                    <span>Some twitter comments from Rick Palacios Jr., Director of Research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting:
Analyzing June new home sales &amp; pricing figures from our monthly builder survey. As one builder noted: “It’s not fun to be a builder anymore.” Lumber relief is nice but pick your poison on other issues. Market commentary from across the country to follow... 
#Richmond builder: “It&#x27;s not fun to be a builder anymore. Cost pressure is killing us. Not only will builders like myself who take 12-24 months to build a house lose margin from increases, but the affordability is becoming a major issue.” 
#Atlanta builder: “Costs have driven up prices &amp; we’re no longer preselling. We will not sell a home until frame stage, so our sales numbers are off for June while awaiting framing stage.”

                    <span>Tracking existing home inventory will be very important this year.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of July 2nd, inventory was at 373 thousand (7 day average), compared to 666 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 44.0%.


A week ago, inventory was at 359 thousand, and was down 46.9% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 21.8% above the record low in early April.

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases, although still well below a normal rate for June.</span>

                    <span>The employment diffusion indexes are useful in gauging how widespread job gains are in a given month.

The BLS diffusion index for total private employment was at 66.1 in June, up from 63.0 in May.
For manufacturing, the diffusion index was at 62.0, down from 63.3 in May.
Think of this as a measure of how widespread job gains or losses are across industries. The further from 50 (above or below), the more widespread the job losses or gains reported by the BLS.  From the BLS: 
Figures are the percent of industries with employment increasing plus one-half of the industries with unchanged employment, where 50 percent indicates an equal balance between industries with increasing and decreasing employment.

Both indexes declined sharply in March 2020, and collapsed to new record lows in April 2020 due to the impact from COVID-19.  Then the indexes increased as the economy bounced back.

Both indexes were solid in June, indicating job growth was widespread across industries.</span>

                    <span>Cyber risk poses serious threats for businesses around the world. This column develops a new text-based measure of cyber risk exposure by leveraging computational linguistics and quarterly earnings transcripts for 12,000+ firms from 85 countries over the past 20+ years. Cyber threats have tripled since 2013 and affected a lot more countries and industries. Cyber risks are priced into the stock market and are contagious. The authors conclude that cyber risk is a source of systemic risk for firms and markets.</span>

                    <span>The pandemic has caused the ECB to push its tools to their extremes. Despite considerably expanding its balance sheet and maintaining negative interest rates, inflation in the euro area remains below target. This column argues that direct transfers by the ECB to individuals, or ‘helicopter money’, should be considered as a viable contingent policy. It estimates that a transfer of 1% of GDP would increase inflation by 0.5 percentage points. A well-communicated policy with a clear exit strategy would be consistent with the ECB’s inflation targeting objective and maintain a clear boundary with fiscal policy.</span>

I&#x27;ve received a number of requests lately to post this again, so here is another update of tracking employment during Presidential terms.  We frequently use Presidential terms as time markers - we could use Speaker of the House, Fed Chair, or any other marker.
Important: There are many differences between these periods.  Overall employment was smaller in the &#x27;80s, however the participation rate was increasing in the &#x27;80s (younger population and women joining the labor force), and the participation rate is generally declining now.  But these graphs give an overview of employment changes.

                    <span>Households’ tendency to hold liquid savings at low interest rates and, at the same time, revolving debt at high interest rates is a long-standing puzzle in household finance. This pattern of behaviour has been observed across many countries, on a variety of revolving credit products including credit cards and overdrafts. Using increasingly available transaction-level data sourced from financial services providers, this column shows that co-holding is often short-lived, and may be best explained by consumers keeping separate ‘savings’ and ‘debt’ accounts earmarked for different forms of expenditures, a form of mental accounting.</span>

                    <span>Faced with extreme old age and even dementia among its judges, some US states have imposed a mandatory retirement age. But this policy may remove experienced judges who are still productive in their jobs. This column examines the overall effect of mandatory retirement on court productivity in US states during 1947–1994 and finds that court productivity increased by more than 25% after the introduction of mandatory retirement. There may even be a team effectof ageing whereby the presence of older judges slows down the pace of work in the court.</span>

Exports and imports increased in May. 
Exports are up 41% compared to May 2020; imports are up 38% compared to May 2020.
Both imports and exports decreased sharply due to COVID-19, and have now bounced back (imports  more than exports),
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit, with and without petroleum.
 The blue line is the total deficit, and the black line is the petroleum deficit, and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products.
Note that net, imports and exports of petroleum products are close to zero.
The trade deficit with China decreased to $26.3 billion in May, from $26.9 billion in May 2020.</span>

This graph shows light vehicle sales since 2006 from the BEA (blue) and the BEA&#x27;s estimate for June (red).
The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
Since April 2020, sales have increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic). 


Sales-to-date are down 1.3% compared to the same period in 2019.

Leisure and hospitality gained 343 thousand jobs.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 2.2 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back almost 73% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment declined 7 thousand in June, and manufacturing added 15 thousand jobs.


NOTE: State and Local education added 230 thousand jobs, seasonally adjusted.  But this is a seasonal quirk - there were actually 413 thousand education jobs lost in June NSA, but…</span>

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 850,000 in June, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.9 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, public and private education, professional and business services, retail trade, and other services.
...
The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised down by 9,000, from +278,000 to +269,000, and the change for May was revised up by 24,000, from +559,000 to +583,000. With these revisions, employment in April and May combined is 15,000 higher than previously reported.

The first graph shows the year-over-year change in total non-farm employment since 1968.
In June, the year-over-year change was 7.919 million jobs.  This was up significantly - since employment collapsed in April 2020.
Total payrolls increased by 850 thousand in June.  Private payrolls increased by 662 thousand.
Payrolls for April and May were revised up 15 thousand, combined.
The second graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but currently is not as severe as the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.
The third graph shows the employment population ratio and the participation rate.
The Labor Force Participation Rate was unchanged at 61.6% in June, from 61.6% in May. This is the percentage of the working age population in the labor force. 
The Employment-Population ratio was unchanged at 58.0% from 58.0% (black line).
I&#x27;ll post the 25 to 54 age group employment-population ratio graph later.
The fourth graph shows the unemployment rate.  
The unemployment rate increased in June to 5.9% from 5.8% in May. 
This was above consensus expectations, and April and May were revised up by 15,000 combined.

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of June 29th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Mild Forbearance Improvement as Quarterly Reviews Continue
As we mentioned last week, there were still more than 300,000 homeowners in forbearance whose plans were scheduled for review by the end of June. Well, of the roughly 146,000 plans reviewed for extension or removal over the past week, 44,000 homeowners left forbearance, while the plans of the other 102,000 were extended.
All in all, we wound up with a net decline of 6,000 plans. Not overly impactful, but it does set us up nicely for what could be a larger improvement next week as some 218,000 plans were still scheduled for review by Wednesday, June 30.
  
Our weekly snapshots run through Tuesday, though. As of June 29, our McDash Flash daily loan-level performance dataset showed 2.05 million homeowners – representing 3.9% of mortgaged properties – remaining in COVID-19 related forbearance plans.
  
Click on graph for larger image.
  
This puts the overall number of active plans down 145,000, a 6.6% decline from the same time last month with the rate of improvement picking up from 6% last week and 5.4% the week before.
  
A 5,000 reduction in the number of active GSE forbearance plans and a 2,000 drop in FHA/VA plans were partially offset by a rise of 1,000 among portfolio and privately held mortgages.
  
Plan starts continued to fall over the last seven days. In fact, last week saw the lowest total starts in five weeks (since the shortened business week of Memorial Day). There have been about 9% fewer starts over the last four weeks than there were in the preceding four-week period..

이벤트:  황만순 대표의 바이오 랜선특강 / 초판 한정 저자 사인본




2020년 벤처 투자 시장은 펀딩 6조 원 시대를 여는 새로운 역사를 썼다. 코로나19는 팬데믹이라는 유례없는 위기를 몰고 왔지만 동시에 많은 기업에게 기회의 장도 제공한 것이다. 많은 일반 투자자들의 관심이 특히 바이오 종목으로 집중되었지만 사실 수년째 바이오는 벤처 캐피털 업계(VC)에서 가장 핫한 투자 섹터로 자리 잡고 있었다. 

그중에서도 황만순 한투파 대표는 남다른 존재감을 발휘해왔다. 2020년만 해도 3,500억 원대의 바이오 섹터 펀드를 결성했고 지놈앤컴퍼니, 젠큐릭스, 엔젠바이오 등의 기업을 상장시키는 등 지금까지 바이오 헬스케어 분야에만 190여 개 기업에 7,500억 원 이상을 투자해왔다.

『대한민국 바이오 투자』는 바이오 섹터에 생소한 일반 개인 투자자의 질문에 대한 답변 형식으로 구성되었으며 바이오 섹터 투자에 있어 꼭 알아야 할 기초적인 관련 지식과 절대 실패하지 않는 투자 방식, 그리고 지녀야 할 마음가짐까지 친절하게 설명한다. 저자는 지난 20년 벤처 캐피털리스트로서 쌓은 경험을 나누고 싶어 이 책을 쓰게 되었으며 독자분들께 조금의 도움이라도 되길 원한다고 담담하게 이야기한다.

                    <span>The notion than an independent central bank reduces a country’s inflation has been embraced by academics, central bankers, and politicians all over the world. This is somehow puzzling, giving the ambiguity reported in empirical studies. This column argues that overall there is only a weak causal link from independence to inflation, if at all. Even a strong inflation-boosting impact from introducing central bank independence cannot be ruled out. These results are obtained from a statistical approach that has not yet been used in analyses of macroeconomic processes, although it exhibits properties well-suited to this end.</span>

                    <span>To gauge the efficacy of policies aimed at spurring growth, we must first fully understand the sources of aggregate growth. This column argues that understanding the drivers of economic growth requires paying attention not only to productivity and R&amp;D dynamics at the firm level, but also to changes in demand for firms’ products. The authors provide a new perspective on commonly used supply-side pro-growth policies and open the door to analysing demand-side policies such as public procurement or product market regulation, which have been present in the policy debate but have largely escaped academic circles.</span>

The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but is now better than the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.

We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 750k in June (mom sa) ... Coupled with very strong labor demand and continued progress on vaccinations and reopening, we believe job growth probably picked up further in the month. ... We estimate a two-tenths drop in the unemployment rate to 5.6%, reflecting a strong household employment gain but a further rise in the participation rate.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 7.3% compared to the same week in 2019.  Leisure (weekend) occupancy has recovered, but weekday (more business) is still down double digits.

From CoStar: STR: Weekly US Hotel Occupancy Inches Closer to 70%
U.S. weekly hotel occupancy hit its highest level since late October 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through June 26.
June 20-26, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 69.9% (-7.3%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$133.36 (-0.5%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$93.19 (-7.8%)
 In addition to occupancy reaching its highest point since the week ending 26 October 2019, ADR and RevPAR were the highest of the pandemic-era. Weekend occupancy surpassed the 2019 comparable for the second time in three weeks, while ADR was 13% higher than the corresponding weekend from June 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the next two months should have decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.</span>

                    <span>From the Census Bureau reported that overall construction spending decreased:
Construction spending during May 2021 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,545.3 billion, 0.3 percent below the revised April estimate of $1,549.5 billion. The May figure is 7.5 percent above the May 2020 estimate of $1,437.7 billion.

Private spending increased and public spending decreased:
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,203.3 billion, 0.3 percent below the revised April estimate of $1,206.8 billion. ...
In May, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $342.0 billion, 0.2 percent below the revised April estimate of $342.7 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 11% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 9% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been weak recently.
Public construction spending is 5% above the previous peak in March 2009, and 30% above the austerity low in February 2014, but weak recently.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 28.7%.  Non-residential spending is down 5.8% year-over-year.  Public spending is down 8.7% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service in most areas and did not decline sharply like many other sectors, but some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 23.2% YoY, multi-retail down 18.0% YoY, and office down 8.3% YoY.

This was below consensus expectations of a 0.4% increase in spending, however construction spending for the previous months was revised up.</span>

세상을 움직이는 33가지 핵심 경제이론을 깔끔하게 정리한 경제 입문서다. 리처드 세일러의 ‘넛지 이론’, 대니얼 카너먼의 ‘전망 이론’, 쉬나 아이엔가의 ‘상품 선택의 법칙’ 등 행동경제학과 게임이론에서부터 현대 화폐 이론(MMT)과 피케티의 21세기 자본론까지 꼭 알아야 할 최신 경제이론을 한 권에 담았다. 

또한 애덤 스미스의 ‘보이지 않는 손’, 리카도의 비교우위론, 케인스의 유효수요론, 슘페터의 경기순환론 등 역사적으로 중요한 경제이론들이 어떻게 발전해오며 세계를 변화시켰는지 살펴본다. 경제이론과 실물 경제가 어떤 지점에서 어긋나는지, 경제이론의 한계도 지적한다. 이 책은 세상을 움직이는 경제의 원리를 쉽지만 제대로 이해하고 싶은 사람들에게 유용한 가이드가 될 것이다.

지금은 버블인가, 아닌가? 현재 상황을 두고 개인 투자자들은 물론 전문가들도 의견이 팽팽하게 맞선다. 급변하는 현재를 어떻게 해석하고 행동을 취해야 하는가? 거대한 전환점에 서 있는 우리는 이익을 얻는 사람이 될 것인가, 잃는 사람이 될 것인가? 이 책은 인류 최초의 버블부터 현재까지 300년 역사를 뒤흔든 버블의 사태를 살펴본다. 왜, 무엇이, 버블을 만들었으며 누가 그것을 이용해 부를 잃고 누군가는 이익을 얻었는지 반복되는 호황과 불황의 주기를 바탕으로 통찰력을 제공한다.

저자들은 ‘시장성·자본·투기’가 만드는 거품 경제를 ‘버블 트라이앵글’이라고 분석하며 새로운 프레임워크를 제시한다. 역사상 버블의 사태는 이 3가지 요건의 비이성적 패턴을 가졌다는 것이다. 사회적 변화와 이슈가 있을 때마다 전 세계 경제는 대전환기를 맞아왔다. 코로나 19가 지핀 전 세계 경제 변화는 씨앗의 형태가 다를 뿐, 역사상 최초의 현상이 아니다. &#x27;파이낸셜타임스&#x27;가 선정한 올해의 책이자, 급변하는 경제 상황을 분석하고 새로운 프레임워크를 제시하는 을 통해 거인의 어깨, 놀라운 통찰에서 그 답을 구해보자.

                    <span>Over the past two decades, governments and regulators have worked to foster competition among trading venues, leading to market fragmentation and contributing to a drastic reduction in the cost of trading. But this also led exchanges to heighten their reliance on revenue generating activities such as the sale of market data, co-location space, and fast connections to matching engines. This column argues that a connectivity fee or entry regulations could work well from a regulatory perspective, and highlights the important role of exchanges’ technological capacity decisions as a driver of liquidity.</span>

This column uses data on Kenyan horticulture suppliers to explore whether suppliers from the Global South are benefitting from increased opportunities for economic upgrading as trade in these value chains grow. It finds that suppliers who develop multi-chain strategies across both the global North and South diversify production more and achieve higher economic returns than those who do not.</span>

차세대 산업혁명인 4차 산업혁명은 지금껏 상상만 해 왔던 기술들을 점차 현실화시키고 있다. 많은 이들이 우려하는 대로 이러한 기술의 진보가 인간의 일자리를 빼앗는 일이 이미 벌어지고 있다. 얼마 전까지만 해도 사람이 제공하던 서비스들을 이제 AI(인공지능)나 로봇 등의 기계가 대신 하는 일이 급속히 늘고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 본격적으로 진행될수록 이런 현상은 더욱 가속화할 것이다.

저자는 일과 일자리 관점에서 볼 때 4차 산업혁명은 인간의 사고를 뿌리까지 바꾸게 함으로써 이전과는 완전히 다른 세상을 도래하게 만드는 ‘변곡점’이 될 것이라 확신하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명을 통해 발전할 기술들로 인해 기존의 일자리 대다수가 사라질 가능성이 농후하기 때문이다. 

많은 이들이 4차 산업혁명의 기술적 성취에 취해 장밋빛 미래를 그리고 있는 지금, 저자는 다음과 같은 질문을 던진다. 4차 산업혁명이 성공적으로 마무리되고 나면 우리는 기술 진보의 혜택을 마음껏 향유할 수 있을까? 현재와 같은 우리 일자리는 남아 있을까? 그때에도 우리는 먹고살기 위해 일해야 할까? 모든 면에서 인류를 능가하는 AI가 등장해도 우리는 지금처럼 생태계 최정상의 지위를 유지할 수 있을까?

이 책은 인류 문명 탄생부터 AI와 로봇까지, 일과 일자리 변천사를 일목요연하게 정리하고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 앞선 산업혁명들과 본질적으로 어떤 차이가 있으며 어느 정도의 파급력을 가질지에 대해 통찰력 있는 전망을 내놓고 있다. 그리고 기술 진보가 예고된 미래 세상을 디스토피아가 아닌 유토피아로 만들기 위해 지금 인류가 어떤 준비를 해야 하는지에 대해서도 구체적인 방안을 제시한다.

[라이노 파이썬]은 라이노 환경과 사용법에 어느 정도 익숙한 독자를 대상으로 하고 있으며, 파이썬 언어를 활용한 라이노 프로그램의 조형 연구 및 제어를 다루고 있다. 이 책의 근본적인 목적은 특정 언어 및 프로그램의 사용법을 익히게 하는 것이 아니라, 건축 디지털 디자인과 관련된 프로그래밍에 대한 기본적인 이해를 돕고 3D 프로그램과의 연동 및 그 가능성을 탐구하도록 하는 것이다. 

건축 디자이너로서 프로그래밍을 어떻게 받아들여야 하는지, 프로그래밍은 무엇을 할 수 있는지, 스크립트를 쓸 때는 어떻게 생각해 나가야 하는지, 기본적인 바탕으로 숙지해야 되는 내용은 무엇인지 등 디지털 디자인에 대한 생각을 정리하고, 직접 뛰어들어 써 나갈 수 있도록 방향을 제시할 수 있는 조력자의 역할을 수행하고자 한다.

본 연구는 북한당국이 발표하는 지역별 토지가격이나 토지의 특성에 관한 자료들이 없는 조건에서 북한지역의 토지가격과 토지자산의 규모를 추정하는 방법론과 모형을 제시하고 이를 이용하여 북한 시가화지역 전체를 대상으로 시장가격 기준의 토지자산 규모를 실험적으로 추정하였다.   우선 관련 사회경제적 변수를 이용가능하면서 최근의 북한과 소득수준의 격차가 상대적으로 크지 않았던 것으로 평가되는 남한의 1970년대 중후반, 그리고 도시화 수준이 유사했던 1980년대 초반 남한의 시, 군, 구별 실거래가격을 기준으로 시가화지역 토지에 대한 지가결정함수를 도출하였다. 다음으로 북한지역에 대한 지리정보분석을 통해 도출되는 지가결정요인의 대리변수들을 대입하여 2015년경 북한 시가화지역 토지의 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율을 산출하였다. 더 나아가서 최근 북한지역 일부 도시들을 대상으로 조사된 주택거래가격과 본고에서 추정한 상대가격비율을 결합하여 북한전역을 대상으로 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모를 추정하였다.  추정결과 북한 시가화지역의 토지가격은 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율로 볼 때 평양시 동대원구역이 100으로 제일 높고 양강도 풍서군이 1.70으로 가장 낮은 것으로 평가되었다. 한편 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모는 2015년 기준 216억 달러로 추정되었는데, 이는 동년 북한GDP의 1.2~1.3배에 달하는 규모이다.  이 비율은 남한의 1978~1980년과 비슷한데, 해당시기의 남한의 경제성장률이 평균 6%인데 반해 북한은 1%대 수준인 것을 고려하면 상당히 높은 것으로 보인다.</span>

본 연구에서는 2017년과 2019년 이민자 체류실태 및 고용조사 자료를 이용하여 직업훈련 프로그램이 외국인의 노동시장 성과에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 성향점수매칭(propensity score matching)을 적용한 분석 결과를 살펴보면, 직업훈련은 평균적으로 외국인들의 고용률을 6.4%p 높였으며 월평균임금을 상승시키는 효과도 있었다. 또한, 체류자격에 따라 상이한 효과가 나타났는데 먼저 취업비자로 들어온 외국인은 훈련참여의 결과로 고용률이 크게 높아지지 않았지만 임금 상승효과는 상당히 컸다. 반면, 결혼이민자의 경우 임금에 대한 긍정적 효과가 관찰되지 않았다. 정주비자 소지자는 훈련을 통해 고용률과 임금이 모두 증가하였다.</span>

본 연구는 1981년부터 2019년까지 한국의 생산가능인구 1인당 실질 GDP 추세성장률을 추정하기 위해 추세성장률이 임의보행을 따르는 비관측요인모형을 사용한다. 추정 결과, 추세성장률은 외환위기를 극복하던 시기인 2000년 전후를 제외하고 1980년대 후반부터 2010년대 초반까지 지속해서 하락하였다. 추세성장회계를 통해 추세성장률 하락요인을 분석한 결과, 지속적인 추세성장률 하락은 노동생산성 둔화와 관련이 깊은 것으로 나타났다. 구체적으로 살펴보면, 1988년부터 1998년까지의 추세성장률 1차 하락기는 외환위기 이전부터 둔화되기 시작한 노동증강 총요소생산성에 가장 큰 영향을 받았다. 이러한 결과는 외환위기로 추세성장률이 하락했다는 가설과는 배치되는 것이다. 한편 부진한 투자는 2002년부터 2012년까지의 2차 하락기의 중요한 배경인 것으로 나타났다.</span>

오랫동안 학자들은 인간 행동도 바이러스처럼 우연한 접촉을 통해 전파된다고 믿었다. 그러나 새로운 믿음이나 행동, 규범의 확산은 질병의 확산과는 다른 규칙을 따른다. 무엇보다 이러한 변화들은 개인의 삶을 뒤바꿀 뿐 아니라 기업과 정부, 세계 질서에 거대한 전환을 불러온다. 아무도 경험하지 못한 대변혁의 길목에서 이제는 ‘변화는 어떻게 일어나는가’라는 근본적인 질문을 던져야 하는 이유다.

이 책은 우리 주변에서 발생하는 크고 작은 변화의 메커니즘을 과학적으로 밝힌다. 변화는 어떻게 일어나고, 찻잔 속 태풍으로 끝나는 일이 왜 그토록 많은가? 가망 없어 보이던 혁신이 안착하고, 논란을 동반한 홍보 캠페인이 승리를 거두고, 비주류로 불리던 운동이 세상을 뒤흔든 데에는 어떤 비밀이 숨어 있는가?

20년 넘게 방대한 연구를 이어온 저자는 그 핵심이 소셜 네트워크, 즉 사회적 연결망에 있음을 증명해낸다. 복잡한 전염(complex contagion)이라는 개념에 따르면, 기존의 믿음과 규범을 흔드는 변화일수록 가족이나 친구, 동료처럼 끈끈하게 연결된 관계가 확산의 성패를 좌우한다. 소수의 유명 인플루언서와 오피니언 리더가 다수를 움직인다는 통념이 뒤집히는 순간이다.

전 세계를 강타한 코로나19 바이러스의 대유행으로 수억 명의 감염자와 수백만 명의 사망자가 발생하면서 지구촌 전체가 큰 위기를 맞고 있다. 4차 산업혁명과 인공지능을 기반으로 한 과학기술의 발전으로 인류는 보다 편리하고 풍요로운 미래를 맞이하게 되었지만 디지털 전환과 맞물려서 가속화된 비대면 방식의 삶과 급격한 일자리 변화는 그동안 우리 사회를 움직여왔던 메커니즘에 상당한 충격을 안겨 주었다.    

《팬데믹과 한국 사회의 대전환》은 국내를 대표하는 5인의 석학들이 코로나 이후 한국 사회를 진단하고 뉴노멀을 향한 시대의 갈림길에서 인간, 사회 그리고 세상에 대한 근원적인 질문을 던진다. 고(故) 박태준 포스코 명예회장 10주기 추모 학술 연구로 2020년 12월 진행된 ‘포스텍 미래 전략 좌담회’ 내용을 정리한 이 책에서는 팬데믹 상황에서 위기에 처한 우리의 안전과 자유’를 다시 생각해 보고 시장경제의 변화가 민주주의에 어떠한 영향을 미치는지 살펴본다. 

또한 인류가 처했던 역사적 위기 상황을 현재와 비교하고 해결책을 제시하며, 팬데믹으로 가속화된 불평등과 양극화 현상의 이유와 탈진실의 시대에 우리가 어떻게 생각하고 행동해야 이러한 위기를 극복할 수 있는지 살펴본다.

60만 명. 쉬이 가늠되지 않는 숫자다. 15만 8,000명. 구체적으로 그려지지 않는 건 마찬가지다. 앞의 숫자는 1999년부터 2017년 사이에 사망한 사람의 수고, 뒤의 숫자는 그중 2017년 한 해에 해당하는 사망자 수다. 

15만 8,000명의 사망자는 매일 세 대의 보잉 737 여객기가 추락해 승객 전원이 죽는 사고가 발생하는 것과 같다. 그런데, 이 사망자 숫자가 의미하는 것은 무엇일까? 미국 중년 백인층의 사망률에 돌연 반전이 일어나지 않았다면, 즉 20세기 들어 멈춤 없이 낮아지던 사망률의 흐름이 계속 유지되었다면 죽지 않았을 사람의 수다. 

노벨경제학상을 받은 경제학자 앵거스 디턴과 보건경제학의 귄위자 앤 케이스는 이처럼 일어나지 말았어야 하는 죽음에 ‘절망사’라는 이름을 붙인다. 이는 저소득·저학력 백인층에서 나타나는 현상으로 자살, 약물 중독, 알코올 중독으로 인한 죽음이다. 경제학의 두 거장은 오늘날 미국을 강타한 절망사라는 비극, 어쩌면 머지않아 다른 나라와 다른 세대의 문제가 될지 모르는 전염병에 대해 이야기한다.

나아가 두 저자는 절망사라는 단서에서 출발해 미국의 경제 시스템과 사회 전반을 해부하고 문제의 근본 원인을 파고들어, 우리…</span>

우리 사회를 휩싸고 있는 사회불평등, 실업과 고용불안정, 생태계 파괴와 기후위기 등은 시장만능주의와 맹목적인 경제성장의 결과이다. 이러한 자본주의의 고삐 풀린 질주와 획일성에 맞서는 것으로서 제3섹터 실천들이 새롭게 조명 받고 있다. 이 실천들에 대한 명칭은 사회적경제, 연대경제, 사회적기업, 비영리부문, 결사체부문 등 국가와 지역에 따라 다양하다. 하지만 이 실천들을 ‘사회연대경제’로 포괄할 수 있는데, 이 책은 이를 통해 시장논리와 비시장논리, 나아가 비화폐논리를 조율하는 제3섹터가 지닌 다원적 경제의 관점과 실천을 명확히 이해하는 길을 열어준다.

&#x27;사회연대경제&#x27;는 사회연대경제에 대한 학술연구 발전에서 주요한 역할을 담당했던 불어권 유수의 연구자들이 참여한 공동작업의 결과물로, 각 장은 해당 실천 범주에 대한 종합정리라 할 수 있다. 우리 사회의 학술적 토론뿐만 아니라 현장의 실천을 위해 필요한 개념적이고 분석적인 토대를 강화하는 데 큰 도움이 될 것이다.

인간다운 삶을 위한 최소 소득을 보장하기 위해 국가나 지방자치단체가 모든 개인에게 조건 없이 정기적으로 현금을 지급하는 기본소득. 양극화 해소와 4차 산업혁명에 따른 사회경제적 변화에 대처할 수 있는 획기적인 정책으로 기대된다. 그러나 이 같은 취지의 제도도 재원 마련이라는 난관을 해결하는 것이 관건이다. 

기본소득 재원으로 ‘국토보유세’를 제시한 이 책은 개인과 법인이 가진 모든 토지에 세금을 매겨 전 국민에게 똑같이 나누면 불평등의 주요 원인인 토지 불로소득도 잡고 기본소득의 재원도 마련할 수 있어 ‘일석이조’라고 설명한다. 또한 과세대상자의 95%는 내는 세금보다 기본소득으로 받는 금액이 더 많은 순수혜가구인 ‘기본소득형 국토보유세’는 조세 저항의 부담도 적다는 것.  

『답이 있는 기본소득』은 이 같은 기본소득형 국토보유세 설계를 위해 부동산 실태 및 보유세제 개편 방향과 경제적 영향력을 치밀하게 분석했으며 입법안까지 제시하는 등 국토보유세를 둘러싼 모든 쟁점들에 대해 상세히 답을 밝히고 있다. 

기본소득형 국토보유세를 통해 ‘부동산 공화국’, ‘불로소득 공화국’이라는 오명을 벗고 21세기형 경제정의를 구현할 기본소득을 현실화시킬 수 있을지 길을 보여주는 책이다.

파이썬은 초보자부터 전문가까지 사용자층을 보유하고 있는데 그 이유는 누구나 쉽게 접근하여 대부분의 응용 소프트웨어에서 사용 가능하기 때문이다. 동적 타이핑(Dynamic typing) 범용 프로그래밍 언어로, 펄 및 루비가 있는데 파이썬과 자주 비교되지만 다양한 플랫폼에서 쓸 수 있고, 라이브러리(모듈)가 풍부하여, 대학 및 다양한 교육기관, 연구 기관 및 산업계에서 이용이 증가하고 있다.

지난해 하반기 이후 우리나라의 금융시스템은 대체로 안정된 모습을 유지하였다. 코로나19 재확산 움직임에도 불구하고 경기회복 기대가 커지면서 금융시장은 비교적 안정세를 보였고, 금융중개기능도 원활히 작동하였다. 전반적인 금융시스템 상황을 보여주는 금융안정지수(FSI)는 작년 4월 위기단계 진입 이후 하락세를 지속하여 금년 5월에는 주의단계 임계치(8)를 하회하는 1.8(잠정)까지 낮아졌다.
    


    
금융안정 상황을 부문별로 살펴보면, 신용시장의 경우 가계와 기업 모두 차입을 늘리면서 민간신용의 높은 증가세가 이어지는 가운데 명목GDP 성장률이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 명목GDP 대비 민간신용 비율이 큰 폭 상승하였다. 가계신용은 주택 매매·전세 관련 대출 증가 등의 영향으로 증가세가 확대된 반면 가계의 처분가능소득 증가율이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 가계의 채무상환부담이 늘어났다.
    


    
기업신용도 코로나19 장기화 등에 따른 자금수요 지속 등으로 증가세를 이어갔다. 기업의 전반적인 재무상황이 개선되고 있으나 기업간 채무상환능력의 차이는 심화되었다. 한편 가계 및 기업 대출 연체율이 낮은 수준을 유지하고 있으나 향후 경기회복이 부문간·업종간 차별화되는 양상을 보일 경우 가계와 기업의 취약부문을 중심으로 부실 위험이 커질 수 있다.

이 책은 단순히 머신러닝의 알고리즘 사용법을 알려주는 것이 아니라 파이썬을 이용해 알고리즘을 처음부터 구현해봄으로써 알고리즘의 동작 원리를 이해하는 것을 목표로 한다. 따라서 현업에서 프레임워크나 라이브러리를 사용하면서 잊기 쉬운 머신러닝의 기초와 기반 구조를 이해할 수 있다. 또한 머신러닝 알고리즘을 설명하기에 앞서 머신러닝에 필수적인 수학의 기본기를 탄탄히 쌓아가기 때문에 머신러닝에 대한 응용과 문제해결 능력을 키우는 데 힘을 실어준다.

미래차의 등장과 함께 자동차 산업은 하루가 다르게 급변하고 있다. 주가도 하루가 다르게 변하고 있다. 1950년대 자동차 산업의 대호황기 때와 비교할 수도 없을 만큼 화려하고 거대한 호황기가 오고 있다. 자동차 산업의 패러다임이 송두리째 변하기 때문이다. 심지어 플랫폼, 승차 공유 등 모빌리티의 영역은 그 끝을 알 수 없을 만큼 빠르게 확장되는 중이다.

이제 지금까지의 자동차 산업 투자 전략은 의미가 없다. 근본부터가 변했다. 산업이 변하고 시선이 변한 만큼 투자 지도도 새롭게 그려야 한다. 말 그대로 판을 다시 짜야 하는 셈이다. 새롭게 전략을 짜는 방법은 『지금, 모빌리티에 투자하라』에 모두 담겨 있다.

증권가에서 가장 뛰어난 자동차 분야 애널리스트 유지웅이 친절하게 그려주는 투자 지도가 궁금하다면 지금 바로 펼쳐보자. 상상하지 못했던 냉철한 산업 분석과 명쾌한 모빌리티 투자 전략을 따라가다 보면 어느새 당신만의 투자 전략이 세워져 있을 것이다.

ESG는 현재 경제·경영계와 자본시장 전반을 지배하는 핵심 화두 중 하나다. 일반인들조차 TV나 기사 등으로 심심찮게 이 용어를 접할 정도다. 그러나 빠른 전파 속도만큼 ESG에 대한 오해나 불신 또한 널리 퍼져있다.

경제학자 출신으로 국내 최정상 IT 기업의 경영자와 정부 정책 입안자라는 독보적인 경력을 가진 저자는, ESG를 기존의 기업이나 경영자가 아닌 투자자의 관점에서 새롭게 접근한다. 지금까지의 ESG 관련 이론과 현황을 설명하는 것은 물론, ESG를 촉발시킨 배경, 혼용되는 여러 개념 등을 깔끔하게 정리하고 비교하며 체계적으로 ESG를 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다. 

그뿐만 아니라 실무적으로 유용한 ESG 평가 방식과 한계까지 꼼꼼히 다룬다. 마지막에는 ESG 시대를 준비하는 세계 각국 정부와 기업의 대응 방식, ESG 투자시장 전망까지 폭넓게 다룸으로써 독자 스스로가 자본주의의 미래를 그려볼 수 있게 한다.
