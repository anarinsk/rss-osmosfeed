                    <span>Persuasive communication relies not only on content but also on its delivery. This column uses machine learning algorithms to examine the persuasiveness of delivery in startup pitches to venture capitalists. Positive (i.e. passionate, warm) pitches increase the probability of funding, but on receiving funding, high-positivity startups tend to underperform. Women are more heavily judged on delivery when evaluating single-gender teams, but they are neglected when pitching alongside men. The results of an experiment suggest that persuasion delivery works mainly through leading investors to form inaccurate beliefs.</span>

California’s housing market moderated for the third straight month in July with both home sales and prices tempering from the heated market conditions seen over the past year, while still staying above pre-pandemic levels, the CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS® (C.A.R.) said today.
Closed escrow sales of existing, single-family detached homes in California totaled a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 428,980 in July, according to information collected by C.A.R. from more than 90 local REALTOR® associations and MLSs statewide.

                    <span>From BofA: 
3Q GDP growth is currently coming in at 4.5%, leaving annual growth to slip to 5.9% this year. We think the Delta variant is a large reason for the soft patch as can be seen by the pullback in spending on leisure services.  But we also have to consider the possibility of more permanent supply-side constraints and greater precautionary savings.  [August 20 estimate]
emphasis added
From Goldman Sachs: 
We have lowered our Q3 GDP forecast to +5.5%, reflecting hits to both consumer spending and production. Spending on dining, travel, and some other services is likely to decline in August, though we expect the drop to be modest and brief. Production is still suffering from supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto industry, and this is likely to mean less inventory rebuild in Q3. [August 18 estimate]
From the NY Fed Nowcasting Report
The New York Fed Staff Nowcast stands at 3.5% for 2021:Q3. News from this week’s data releases decreased the nowcast for 2021:Q3 by 0.3 percentage point. [August 20 estimate]
And from the Altanta Fed: GDPNow
The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the third quarter of 2021 is 6.1 percent on August 18, down from 6.2 percent on August 17. [August 18 estimate]</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 17th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances Edge Slightly Higher
After dropping by more than 150,000 over the past two weeks, we once again saw active forbearance plans edge up slightly in what has become a well-established mid-month trend. 
  
The week’s 11,000 overall increase was driven entirely by a 12,000 rise in plans among Portfolio/PLS loans and offset by a 1,000 decline in GSE forbearances. FHA/VA plan volumes held flat from the week prior. 
  
 According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, 1.75 million (3.3% of) borrowers remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans as of August 17. That population includes 1.9% of GSE, 5.8% of FHA/VA and 4.0% of portfolio-held and privately securitized mortgages.
Plan volumes are now down 110,000 (-5.9%) from the same time last month, with the rate of improvement slowing slightly in recent weeks.
Total plan starts were higher this week, primarily from a rise in re-start activity. New plan starts, though up slightly from last week, remain below the 5-week moving average.  
   Click on graph for larger image.
  
Meanwhile, plan removals hit their lowest weekly total since late May, but mainly due to the fact that review activity was low in general this past week.
 Of those plans reviewed since last Tuesday, 41% resulted in exits, up from the 36% removal rate the same time last month. Activity is poised to pick up significantly with the first wave of final forbearance expirations only weeks away.  
   
 Some 200,000 plans are currently slated for review through the final two weeks of August, with approximately one-third of those reaching their final expiration based on current allowable forbearance term lengths. Volumes of final expirations will increase significantly in September and October.

                    <span>In 1932, Hitler and his followers believed that marching through the streets in uniform would convince the German public to vote them into power. But did the flags, songs and stomping boots actually persuade people? Hans-Joachim Voth tells Tim Phillips how polling data (and the spread of a pandemic) reveal whether this type of propaganda actually worked.

                    <span>I&#x27;m gathering existing home data for many local markets, and I&#x27;m watching inventory very closely this year.

The table below shows some local market data for July.
As I noted in Some thoughts on Housing Inventory 
The key for housing in 2021 will be inventory. If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in house prices. However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.
Although inventory in these areas is down about 33% year-over-year, inventory is up 13.5% month-to-month (and up 26.5% over the last two months).  Seasonally we&#x27;d usually expect a small increase in inventory from June to July - so some of this increase is seasonal (as opposed to a shift in the market).   

It does appear inventory bottomed seasonally in March.  And inventory is still historically very low, but increasing more than just seasonal.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 8.3% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: Seasonal Demand Trends Weigh Down Weekly US Hotel Occupancy
U.S. hotel occupancy and average daily rate (ADR) dipped from previous weeks, according to STR‘s latest data through August 14.
August 8-14, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 65.7% (-8.4%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $139.18 (+5.9%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $91.45 (-3.0%)
While the metrics were down week over week, comparisons with 2019 remained consistent, which is further evidence of seasonality in the data as more schools return to class and leisure demand wanes. Concern around COVID-19 cases also persists.
...
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, is starting to &quot;wane&quot; seasonally.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - especially with the sharp increase in COVID pandemic cases and hospitalizations.</span>

For the purposes of the survey, MBA asks servicers to report loans in forbearance as delinquent if the payment was not made based on the original terms of the mortgage. The delinquency rate was down 91 basis points from the first quarter of 2021 and down 275 basis points from one year ago.

이제껏 세상에 나온 탈성장론들은 체제비판론, 탈성장 미래사회 스케치 수준을 넘지 못했었다. 반면, 탈성장 운동은 이 책 덕분에 비로소 사회경제 시스템 전환 계획을 품은 현실 정치 운동으로 진화하고 있다. 경제성장 없는 그린뉴딜, UBI(보편 기본 소득), UCI(보편 돌봄 소득), UBS(보편 기본 서비스), 커먼스 회복, 노동시간 단축, 공공 금융 제도. 평등한 탈탄소사회라는 미래로 이행하는 데 필요하다고 저자들이 말하는 사회 개혁 정책들이다.

또한 이 책은 우리 시대를 역사적 대전환기라는 인식하에, 어떤 대전환의 비전이 필요한지, 그 청사진을 분명히 제시하고 있어서 눈길을 끈다. 그것은 행복, 평등, 지속가능성, 공동체적 삶, 돌봄, 소박함의 가치를 우선시하며 더 적은 것으로 더 잘 사는 삶이다.

                    <span>The muted reaction of inflation to the initial extreme slump in economic activity would appear to suggest that the Phillips curve is flat or has flattened further during the Covid-19 pandemic. This column argues that in fact there are currently too many confounding factors for an assessment of how the pandemic has affected the Phillips curve relationship. It also finds evidence that underlying inflationary pressures have been dampened by the build-up of economic slack and models that better account for tail events reveal more stable Phillips curve parameters. Taken together, all of this suggests that the Phillips curve is harder to grasp, but still at play.</span>

                    <span>Government support in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the misallocation of public funds and the creation of ‘zombie’ firms. This column uses firm-level data from CompNet for four EU countries to show that Covid-19 support was distributed rather efficiently. Government subsidies were distributed towards medium productive firms, and only marginally towards the undeserving ‘zombies’. However, the negative impact of the pandemic on productivity growth was large and resource reallocation sluggish, which calls for a removal of the blanket as soon as the situation allows.</span>

                    <span>From housing economist Tom Lawler (see important comments on inventory):
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million in July, unchanged from June’s preliminary pace and down 0.7% from last July’s seasonally adjusted pace. Unadjusted sales should show a larger YOY decline, reflecting this July’s lower business day count compared to last July.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that while the inventory of existing homes for sale remained low last month, inventories on the month increased by substantially more than the seasonal norm, and the YOY decline in July was significantly less than in June.  What this means for the NAR’s inventory estimate for July, however, is unclear  As I’ve noted before, the inventory measure in most publicly-released local realtor/MLS reports excludes listings with pending contracts, but that is not the case for most of the reports sent to the NAR (referred to as the “NAR Report!”),  Since the middle of last Spring inventory measures excluding pending listings have fallen much more sharply than inventory measures including such listings, and this latter inventory measure understates the decline in the effective inventory of homes for sale over the last several months.  Having said that, however, it is clear that seasonally adjusted inventories have been trending higher over the past several months.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 16.1% from last July.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release July existing home sales on Monday, August 23, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 5.84 million SAAR.</span>

Participants discussed aspects of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s asset purchases, including progress made toward the Committee&#x27;s maximum-employment and price-stability goals since the adoption of the asset purchase guidance in December 2020. They also considered the question of how asset purchases might be adjusted once economic conditions met the standards of that guidance. Participants agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the Committee&#x27;s future decisions about modifying asset purchases. No decisions regarding future adjustments to asset purchases were made at this meeting.

From the AIA: Demand for design activity continues to expand
The Architecture Billings Index (ABI) recorded its sixth consecutive positive month, according to a new report today from The American Institute of Architects (AIA).
  
The ABI score for July was 54.6. While this was down slightly from June’s score of 57.1, it still indicates very strong business conditions overall (any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings from the prior month). Scoring for new project inquiries also declined in July but remained near its all-time high at 65.0. The score for new design contracts was essentially unchanged from June to July with a score of 58.0.

                    <span>The BLS released the preliminary annual benchmark revision showing 166,000 fewer payroll jobs as of March 2021. The final revision will be published when the January 2022 employment report is released in February 2022. Usually the preliminary estimate is pretty close to the final benchmark estimate.
The annual revision is benchmarked to state tax records.  From the BLS: 
In accordance with usual practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is announcing the preliminary estimate of the upcoming annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey employment series. The final benchmark revision will be issued in February 2022 with the publication of the January 2022 Employment Situation news release.
Each year, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey employment estimates are benchmarked to comprehensive counts of employment for the month of March. These counts are derived from state unemployment insurance (UI) tax records that nearly all employers are required to file. For National CES employment series, the annual benchmark revisions over the last 10 years have averaged plus or minus one-tenth of one percent of total nonfarm employment. The preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision indicates a downward adjustment to March 2021 total nonfarm employment of -166,000 (-0.1 percent).
emphasis added
Using the preliminary benchmark estimate, this means that payroll employment in March 2021 was 166,000 lower than originally estimated. In February 2022, the payroll numbers will be revised down to reflect the final estimate. The number is then &quot;wedged back&quot; to the previous revision (March 2020).
Construction was revised down by 44,000 jobs, and manufacturing revised down by 39,000 jobs.
This preliminary estimate showed 421,000 fewer private sector jobs, and 255,000 more government jobs (as of March 2021).</span>

                    <span>Earlier: Housing Starts decreased to 1.534 Million Annual Rate in July

Total housing starts in July were above expectations, however starts in May and June were revised up slightly


Single family starts increased in July, and were up 12% year-over-year. Starts declined at the beginning of the pandemic, and then increased due to strong demand.


The volatile multi-family sector is down 16% year-over-year.
The housing starts report showed total starts were down 7.0% in July compared to the previous month, and total starts were up 2.5% year-over-year compared to July 2020.

The first graph shows the month to month comparison for total starts between 2020 (blue) and 2021 (red). 
Click on graph for larger image.
Starts were up 2.5% in July compared to July 2020.  The year-over-year comparison are more difficult starting in the second half of 2021.
In 2020, starts were off to a strong start before the pandemic, and with low interest rates, and little competing existing home inventory, starts finished 2020 strong.  


Starts were solid in the first half of 2021.


The second graph shows starts under construction, Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA).
Red is single family units.  Currently there are 711 thousand single family units under construction (NSA).  This is the highest level since 2006.
  
Blue is for 2+ units.  Currently there are 686 thousand multi-family units under construction.  Last month, at 691 thousand units, was the most since 1974.
  
Combined, there are 1.397 million units under construction.  This is the most since July 2006.</span>

Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,534,000.  This is 7.0 percent below the revised June estimate of 1,650,000, but is 2.5 percent above the July 2020 rate of 1,497,000.  Single‐family housing starts in July were at a rate of 1,111,000; this is 4.5 percent below the revised June figure of 1,163,000. The July rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 412,000.
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,635,000.  This is 2.6 percent above the revised June rate of 1,594,000 and is 6.0 percent above the July 2020 rate of 1,542,000.  Single‐family authorizations in July were at a rate of 1,048,000; this is 1.7 percent below the revised June figure of 1,066,000.  Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 532,000 in July

The first graph shows single and multi-family housing starts for the last several years.
Multi-family starts (red, 2+ units) decreased in July compared to June.   Multi-family starts were down 16% year-over-year in July.
Single-family starts (blue) decreased in July, and were up 12% year-over-year (starts slumped at the beginning of the pandemic, but picked up in July 2020).   
The second graph shows total and single unit starts since 1968. 
The second graph shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and then the eventual recovery (but still not historically high).
Total housing starts in July were well below expectations, however starts in May and June were revised up slightly.

‘파이낸스’라고 하면 ‘기업 재무(corporate finance)’만을 떠올리는 사람이 많다. 하지만 자세히 들여다보면 기업뿐만 아니라 가정과 일상에서도 파이낸스 사고(재무적 사고)를 필요로 한다. 파이낸스 사고법이란 미래에 끼칠 모든 영향을 돈으로 환산하여 파악하고, 상정된 안을 비교해서 가장 적절한 안을 선택하는 방법이다. 일본 디즈니와 맥도날드의 공인회계사인 저자와 함께 인생의 다양한 의사결정을 내리는 데 도움을 주는 파이낸스 사고법을 알아보자.

시작하며

STEP 0 회계 vs. 파이낸스
파이낸스는 다양한 의사결정에 활용할 수 있다
회계는 형식, 파이낸스는 사고방식
회계는 과거, 파이낸스는 미래
회계는 의견, 파이낸스는 사실
회계적 사고와 파이낸스적 사고로 내 집 마련을 생각하다

STEP 1 ‘보이지 않는 비용’을 파악한다
선택을 했더라면 얻을 수 있었던 이익을 비용으로 인식하는 것이 ‘기회비용’
기회비용을 파악하여 미래 매출을 창출한다
과거에 지출한 돈인 ‘매몰 비용’에 대해서는 감정을 배제하고 판단한다
매몰 비용을 무시했어야 할 비즈니스 사례
매몰 비용의 함정을 피하려면 ‘중간 점검’ 시기를 설정해야 한다
매몰 비용을 역으로 이용한다
‘인건비’는 비용 그 자체
‘현금’은 돈을 지출하게 만드는 ‘보이지 않는 비용’
‘시간’을 비용으로 환산한다
파이낸스적 사고를 특정 비용 항목에 국한하여 생각하지 않는다
비용은 신중하게 예측한다

STEP 2 시간가치를 고려한다
장기간에 걸쳐 영향을 미치는 ‘고정비’는 최소한으로 줄인다
고정비보다 더 고정적인 ‘초기 투자 비용
‘회수 기간’은 가능한 짧게 생각한다
‘현금’을 마련하는 데는 비용이 든다
‘언제?’에 따라 돈의 가치는 다르다

STEP 3 차이를 비교한다
비교란 ‘차이점’에 주목하는 것
‘판단 기준’을 정한다
선택지를 빠짐없이 열거하고, 마지막에 비교한다
복수의 안건을 검토할 때는 ‘허들 레이트’를 사용한다
‘금액 &#x3D; NPV’와 ‘이율 &#x3D; IRR’을 구분하여 비교한다

STEP 4 수치를 변환하고 이미지를 연상한다
큰 숫자일수록 쉬운 단위로 변환하여 생각한다
단위를 변환하면 ‘방법’이 보인다
단위를 변환하여 구분하면 시기적절한 ‘정기적 관측’이 가능하다
관리 항목을 구분하면 ‘개인의 목표’가 보인다
회사 내에는 수많은 KPI가 존재한다
KPI는 업종의 특성을 고려하여 정한다
‘비중’과 ‘수익’의 관점에서 매출을 늘린다
부문마다 수익성을 구분하면 개별 ‘부문의 최적화’라는 부작용이 발생한다

경기연구원이 기획하고 이재명 경기도지사가 추천한 ‘공정과 지속가능 프로젝트’ 경제 편이다. 이 책은 포스트 코로나 시대에 한국 경제의 구조적 문제점을 진단하고 이를 극복할 공정하고 지속가능한 경제질서와 새로운 경제 패러다임을 모색한다.

코로나19로 인해 한국 경제의 극심한 이중구조가 고스란히 드러나고 있다. 비정규직 노동자, 영세 자영업자, 저소득 계층은 더 큰 고통을 감내해야 하는 상황이다. 대기업이 성장을 기록하는 동안 중소기업은 매출과 이익 저하에 시달리며 생존을 염려하고 있다. 하위 저소득가구의 근로소득은 10%이상 감소했고, 영세 자영업은 사회적 거리 두기를 견디지 못해 폐업하고 있다. 이런 양극화 심화는 현재 소득의 격차로 끝나지 않고 점점 심화되어 불평등이 대물림될 가능성이 크다. 한국 경제는 새로운 패러다임을 구축해야 할 절박한 시점에 처했다.

《지속가능한 공정경제》는 이런 위기와 기회의 측면을 면밀하게 살펴서 지속가능한 공정경제를 위한 화두에 답하고자 한다. 포스트 코로나 시대에 새로운 경제 패러다임이 지향해야 할 시대적 가치는 무엇인지, 새로운 경제질서는 어떤 모습이고 기존 경제질서는 어떻게 재구조화되어야 하는지, 미래지향적 경제질서를 구현하기 위한 정부의 역할과 정책 기준은 무엇이어야 하는지 등을 탐색한다.

컴퓨터 프로그래밍을 배우는 데에 있어서 기초가 되는 논리들을 이해하고, 이를 활용하여 문제를 풀어가면서 프로그램 제작 훈련을 돕기 위해 만들어진 책이다. 이 훈련의 특징은 프로그래밍의 기초부터 응용까지 15단계로 나누어 각 단계마다 필요한 논리와 개념 설명은 최소한으로 줄이고, 간단한 예제를 통해 이해할 수 있도록 설명한다. 

그러므로 다른 C언어 도서에서 다루는 구체적인 문법들이나 이론적인 설명을 자세하게 다루지 않는다. 각 단계마다 조금씩 수준을 높여 가면서 반복되는 실습문제들을 풀게 되는데, 이런 과정을 거치면서 프로그래밍 논리와 문제해결 능력이 향상되도록 하였다.

                    <span>Medical experts have argued forcefully that using cigarettes harms health, prompting the adoption of myriad anti-smoking policies.  The association between smoking and mortality may, however, be driven by unobserved factors, making it difficult to discern the underlying long-term causal relationship.  In this study, we explore the effects of cigarette taxes experienced as a teenager, which are arguably exogenous, on adult smoking participation and mortality.  A one-dollar increase in teenage cigarette taxes is associated with an 8 percent reduction in adult smoking participation and a 6 percent reduction in mortality.  Mortality effects are most pronounced for heart disease and lung cancer.</span>

                    <span>Motivated by the assessment of racial discrimination in mortgage pricing, we introduce a new methodology for comparing the menus of options borrowers face based on their choices. First, we show how standard regression-based approaches for assessing discrimination in the menus context can lead to misleading and contradictory results. Second, we propose a new methodology that is robust these problems based on relatively weak economic assumptions. More specifically, we use pairwise dominance relationships in choices supplemented by restrictions on the range of plausible menus to define (1) a test statistic for equality in menus and (2) a difference in menus (DIM) metric for assessing whether one group of borrowers would prefer to switch to another group&#x27;s menus. Our statistics are robust to arbitrary heterogeneity in borrower preferences across racial groups, are sharp in terms of identification, and can be efficiently computed using Optimal Transport methods. Third, we devise a new approach for inference on the value of Optimal Transport problems based on directional differentiation. Fourth, we use our methodology to estimate mortgage pricing differentials by race on a novel data set linking 2018--2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to Optimal Blue rate locks. We find robust evidence for mortgage pricing differentials by race, particularly among Conforming mortgage borrowers who are relatively creditworthy.</span>

                    <span>Green energy is produced by relationship-specific assets that are vulnerable to hold-up if contracts are not strictly enforced. I study the role of counterparty risk in the procurement of green energy using data on the universe of solar procurement auctions in India. The Indian context allows clean estimates of how risk affects procurement, because solar power plants set up in the same states, by the same firms, are procured in auctions variously intermediated by either risky states themselves or the central government. I find that: (i) the counterparty risk of an average state increases solar energy prices by 10%; (ii) the intermediation of the central government eliminates this risk premium; (iii) higher prices due to risk reduce investment, because state demand for green energy is elastic. The results suggest that the risk of hold-up places developing countries at a disadvantage in the procurement of green energy.</span>

                    <span>Before the 2020-21 school year, educators, policymakers, and parents confronted the stark and uncertain trade-offs implied by the health, educational, and economic consequences of offering instruction remotely, in person, or through a hybrid of the two. Most public schools in the U.S. chose remote-only instruction and enrollment fell dramatically (i.e., a loss of roughly 1.1 million K-12 students). We examine the impact of these choices on public-school enrollment using unique panel data that combine district-level enrollment trajectories with information on their instructional modes. We find offering remote-only instead of in-person instruction reduced enrollment by 1.1 percentage points (i.e., a 42 percent increase in disenrollment from -2.6 to -3.7 percent). The disenrollment effects of remote instruction are concentrated in kindergarten and, to a lesser extent, elementary schools. We do not find consistent evidence that remote instruction influenced middle or high-school enrollment or that hybrid instruction had an impact.</span>

                    <span>This paper provides experimental evidence showing that members of a majority group systematically shift punishment on innocent members of an ethnic minority.  We develop a new incentivized task, the Punishing the Scapegoat Game, to measure how injustice affecting a member of one’s own group shapes punishment of an unrelated bystander (“a scapegoat”). We manipulate the ethnic identity of the scapegoats and study interactions between the majority group and the Roma minority in Slovakia. We find that when no harm is done, there is no evidence of discrimination against the ethnic minority. In contrast, when a member of one’s own group is harmed, the punishment ”passed” on innocent individuals more than doubles when they are from the minority, as compared to when they are from the dominant group. These results illuminate how individualized tensions can be transformed into a group conflict, dragging minorities into conflicts in a way that is completely unrelated to their behavior.</span>

                    <span>We use a sufficient statistic approach to quantify the general equilibrium effects of population aging on wealth accumulation, expected asset returns, and global imbalances. Combining population forecasts with household survey data from 25 countries, we measure the compositional effect of aging: how a changing age distribution affects wealth-to-GDP, holding the age profiles of assets and labor income fixed. In a baseline overlapping generations model this statistic, in conjunction with cross-sectional information and two standard macro parameters, pins down general equilibrium outcomes. Since the compositional effect is positive, large, and heterogeneous across countries, our model predicts that population aging will increase wealth-to- GDP ratios, lower asset returns, and widen global imbalances through the twenty-first century. These conclusions extend to a richer model in which bequests, individual savings, and the tax-and-transfer system all respond to demographic change.</span>

                    <span>Publishing in economics proceeds much more slowly on average than in the natural sciences, and more slowly than in other social sciences and finance. It is even relatively slower at the extremes. We demonstrate that much of the lag, especially at the extremes, arises from authors’ dilatory behavior in revising their work. The marginal product of an additional round of re-submission at the top economics journals is productive of additional subsequent citations; but conditional on re-submission, journals taking more time is not productive, and authors spending more time is associated with reduced scholarly impact. We offer several proposals to speed up the publication process. These include no-revisions policies; limits on authors’ time revising articles, and limits on editors waiting for dilatory referees.</span>

                    <span>Financial crises have large deleterious effects on economic activity, and as such have been the focus of a large body of research. This study surveys the existing literature on financial crises, exploring how crises are measured, whether they are predictable, and why they are associated with economic contractions. Historical narrative techniques continue to form the backbone for measuring crises, but there have been exciting developments in using quantitative data as well. Crises are predictable with growth in credit and elevated asset prices playing an especially important role; recent research points convincingly to the importance of behavioral biases in explaining such predictability. The negative consequences of a crisis are due to both the crisis itself but also to the imbalances that precede a crisis. Crises do not occur randomly, and, as a result, an understanding of financial crises requires an investigation into the booms that precede them.</span>

                    <span>The Clean Water Act (CWA) significantly improved surface water quality, but at a cost exceeding the estimated benefits. We quantify the effect of the CWA on a direct measure of health and incorporate health benefits into a cost-benefit analysis. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we compare health upstream and downstream from wastewater treatment facilities before and after CWA grant receipt. Pollution only decreased downstream from facilities required to upgrade their treatment technology, and we leverage this additional variation with a triple difference. CWA grants increased average birth weight by 8 grams. A back-of-the-envelope calculation bounds infant health benefits below $29 billion.</span>

                    <span>Publishing takes a long time in economics. Consequently, many authors release “working” versions of their papers. Using data on the NBER working paper series, we show that the dissemination of economics research suffers from an overcrowding problem: An increase in the number of weekly released working papers on average reduces downloads, abstract views, and media attention for each paper. Subsequent publishing and citation outcomes are harmed as well. Furthermore, descriptive evidence on viewership and downloads suggests working papers significantly substitute for the dissemination function of publication. These results highlight inefficiencies in the dissemination of economic research even among the most exclusive working paper series and suggest large social losses due to the slow publication process.</span>

                    <span>To explain the fact that government spending and tax policy are procyclical in emerging and developing countries, we develop a model for the joint behavior of optimal tax rates and government spending over the business cycle. Our set-up relies on financial frictions, which have been shown to be critical features of emerging markets, captured by various degrees of asset market incompleteness as well as varying levels of debt-elastic interest rate spreads. We first uncover a novel theoretical result within a simple static framework: incomplete markets can account for procyclical government spending but not necessarily procyclical tax policy. Explaining procyclical tax policy also requires that the ratio of private to public consumption comoves positively with the business cycle, which leads to larger fluctuations in the tax base. We then show that the procyclicality of tax policy holds in a more realistic DSGE model calibrated to emerging markets. Finally, we illustrate how larger financial frictions, which amplify the business cycle through more procyclical fiscal policies, have sizeable Lucas-type welfare costs.</span>

                    <span>This paper describes the design and analysis of a web-based choice experiment that examines how the demand for earthquake protection in Quebec and British Columbia is influenced by the default option and the structure of the insurance plan. Homeowners in both provinces were given the opportunity to purchase protection against earthquake losses when presented with one of the following options: the current private insurance plan, a high deductible private insurance plan, and a proposed public-private risk pool. The default frame was changed so the homeowner could either opt-in by purchasing this coverage or opt-out of being given this protection and receiving a premium discount.  Assigning participants to a public-private risk pool rather than the current private insurance plan increases the likelihood of purchasing earthquake protection by 151%. The opt-out frame leads to a likelihood greater than 1.6 of purchasing coverage relative to the opt-in frame when given the same plan structure. The policy implications of this finding are discussed.</span>

In the U.S., airborne lead dropped sharply near affected plants, most of which were battery-recycling plants. Exports of used batteries to Mexico rose markedly. In Mexico, production increased at battery-recycling plants, relative to comparable industries, and birth outcomes deteriorated within two miles of those plants, relative to areas slightly farther away.

                    <span>The increased burden of disclosure and governance regulations is often cited as a key reason for the significant decline in the number of publicly-listed companies in the U.S. We explore the connection between regulatory costs and the number of listed firms by exploiting a regulatory quirk: many rules trigger when a firm’s public float exceeds a threshold. Consistent with firms seeking to avoid costly regulation, we document significant bunching around multiple regulatory thresholds introduced from 1992 to 2012. We present a revealed preference estimation strategy that uses this behavior to quantify regulatory costs. Our estimates show that various disclosure and internal governance rules lead to a total compliance cost of 4.1% of the market capitalization for a median U.S. public firm. Regulatory costs have a greater impact on private firms’ IPO decisions than on public firms’ going private decisions. However, heightened regulatory costs only explain a small fraction of the decline in the number of public firms.</span>

                    <span>This paper revisits and proposes a resolution to an empirical and theoretical controversy between Keynes and the “classics” (or monetarists). The controversy dates to Keynes’s General Theory (1936)—most famously formalized in Hicks’s (1937) classic Econometrica article, in which the IS-LM model is first formally stated. We first replicate empirical tests formulated in the late 1960s and ’70s and show that more recent data have more statistical power and resolve the empirical debate in favor of the Keynesians, at least according to the criteria of the literature at that time. We then show, using a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, that the empirical tests suffer from the Lucas (1976) critique, as the conclusion fundamentally depends upon the assumed policy regime. Nevertheless, we argue, this new empirical result is useful: it provides evidence for the existence of a “Keynesian policy regime” according to which traditional monetary expansion loses its impact in the absence of a policy regime change, in the sense of Sargent (1982).</span>

                    <span>We analyze data on tens of thousands of alternating-offer, business-to-business negotiations in the wholesale used-car market, with each negotiation mediated (over the phone) by a third-party company. The data shows the identity of the employee mediating the negotiations. We find that who intermediates the negotiation matters: high-performing mediators are 22.03% more likely to close a deal than low performers. Effective mediators improve bargaining outcomes by helping buyers and sellers come to agreements faster, not by pushing disagreeing parties to persist, and have real effects on efficiency for some negotiations, overcoming some of the inefficiency inherent in incomplete-information settings.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the effect of a restorative justice intervention targeted at youth ages 13 to 17 facing felony charges of medium severity (e.g., burglary, assault).  Eligible youths were randomly assigned to participate in the Make-it-Right (MIR) restorative justice program or to a control group in which they faced criminal prosecution.  We estimate the effects of MIR on the likelihood that a youth will be rearrested in the four years following randomization. Assignment to MIR reduces the likelihood of a rearrest within six months by 19 percentage points, a 44 percent reduction relative to the control group.  Moreover, the reduction in recidivism persists even four years after randomization.  Thus, our estimates show that juvenile restorative justice conferencing can reduce recidivism among youth charged with relatively serious offenses and can be an effective alternative to traditional criminal justice practices.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the optimal design of second-best corrective regulation, when some agents or activities cannot be perfectly regulated. We show that policy elasticities and Pigouvian wedges are sufficient statistics to characterize the marginal welfare impact of regulatory policies in a large class of environments. We show that the optimal second-best policy is determined by a subset of policy elasticities: leakage elasticities, and characterize the marginal value of relaxing regulatory constraints. We apply our results to scenarios with unregulated agents/activities and with uniform regulation across agents/activities. We illustrate our results in applications to shadow banking, scale-invariant regulation, asset substitution, and fire sales.</span>

                    <span>India&#x27;s Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947 requires firm with more than 100 workers to pay large costs if they shrink their employment. Since the early 2000s, large Indian manufacturing firms have increasingly relied on contract workers who are not subject to the IDA. By 2015, contract workers accounted for 38% of total employment at firms with more than 100 workers compared to 20% in 2000. Over the same time period, the thickness of the right tail of the firm size distribution in formal Indian manufacturing plants increased, the average product of labor for large firms declined, the job creation rate for large firms increased, and the probability that large firms introduce new products rose.  We provide evidence that these outcomes were caused by an increased reliance on contract labor among large establishments. A model of firm growth subject to firing costs suggests the rise of contract labor increased TFP in Indian manufacturing by 7.6%, occurring all through a one-time reduction in misallocation between large and small firms with negligible change in the long-run growth rate.</span>

This column examines the long-term impact of the 2011 earthquake in Japan on auto and electronics supply chains using data on imports of Japanese products worldwide. Imports shifted to new suppliers, especially in products where dependence on Japan was greater. The new suppliers tended to be developing and large countries, suggesting cost and scale were important. The observed pattern of switching may be relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

The July 2021 CfM survey asked the members of its UK panel to evaluate the impact of central banks on inequality and whether the Bank of England should consider income and wealth distribution in its monetary policy decisions. The majority the panel thinks monetary policy has only a small impact on wealth and income inequality.

Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation&#x27;s container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average.

On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was up 0.2% in July compared to the rolling 12 months ending in June.   Outbound traffic was down 2.2% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports.
Imports were up 2% YoY in July (recovered last year in July following the early months of the pandemic), and exports were down 24.0% YoY.</span>

From the NAHB: Builder Confidence at 13-Month Low on Higher Material Costs, Home Prices
Builder sentiment in the market for newly-built single-family homes fell five points to 75 in August, according to the latest National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI). The index is at its lowest point since July 2020.
Higher construction costs and supply shortages have led to significant price growth, which in turn has caused prospective buyers to experience sticker shock. The decline in the buyer traffic index to its lowest level since July 2020 is evidence that supply-side constraints have begun to hold consumers back.
...
The HMI index gauging current sales conditions fell five points to 81 and the component measuring traffic of prospective buyers also posted a five-point decline to 60. The gauge charting sales expectations in the next six months held steady at 81.
Looking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast fell one point to 74, the Midwest dropped two points to 68, the South posted a three-point decline to 82 and the West registered a two-point drop to 85.

Industrial production increased 0.9 percent in July after moving up 0.2 percent in June. In July, manufacturing output rose 1.4 percent. About half of the gain in factory output is attributable to a jump of 11.2 percent for motor vehicles and parts, as a number of vehicle manufacturers trimmed or canceled their typical July shutdowns. Despite the large increase last month, vehicle assemblies continued to be constrained by a persistent shortage of semiconductors; the production of motor vehicles and parts in July was about 3-1/2 percent below its recent peak in January 2021. The output of utilities decreased 2.1 percent in July, while the index for mining rose 1.2 percent.
At 101.1 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production in July was 6.6 percent above its year-earlier level but 0.2 percent below its pre-pandemic (February 2020) level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose 0.7 percentage point in July to 76.1 percent, a rate that is 3.5 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

This graph shows Capacity Utilization. This series is up from the record low set in April 2020, but still below the level in February 2020.
Capacity utilization at 76.1% is 3.5% below the average from 1972 to 2020.
Note: y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the change.

The second graph shows industrial production since 1967.
Industrial production increased in July to 101.1.  This is 0.2% below the February 2020 level.
The change in industrial production was above consensus expectations, probably due to vehicle manufacturers not shutting down in July.</span>

자본주의 물질문명이 형성되는 역사의 과정을 쉽고 친절하게, 역사학계의 최신 연구 성과를 바탕으로 깊이 있게 제시하는 책. 지금 우리가 누리는 물질문명이 어떻게 출현하고 발전했는지 동ㆍ서양과 한국을 가로지르고 과거와 현재를 넘나들며 폭넓게 조망한다. 그럼으로써 세계사적 관점에서 현재의 세계를 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다. 

이 책은 300년 동안 급속도로 진행된 이 세계의 변화가 도대체 무엇이었는지 구체적 사실(史實)로 톺아보는데, 저자는 물질문명을 이루어낸 원동력의 범주를 세 가지로 분석한다. 하나는 물질생활을 풍요롭게 만드는 제일 조건인 ‘생산 증대’, 그리고 생산 증대를 가능하게 한 ‘과학 기술의 비약적 발전’, 나머지 하나는 윤택한 생활의 최종 결과이자 오늘날 문명을 지배하는 ‘소비’다.

                    <span>The empirical evidence on the relationship between trade orientation and growth in developing countries has been hotly contested for over half a century. This column focuses on the dynamic effects of trade liberalisation on tax revenue. Using a worldwide panel dataset, it shows a statistically negative effect of liberalisation on (non-resource) tax revenues in the short term and no significant effect in the medium term. Implementing a VAT prior to liberalisation mitigates its negative effects on tax revenues.</span>

The database can be used in a variety of contexts. A few potential applications are illustrated, analysing the evolution of inflation since 1970, the behaviour of inflation during global recessions, and the synchronisation of inflation across countries and over time,</span>

                    <span>Note: This is as of August 8th.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Decreases to 3.26%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 14 basis points from 3.40% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 3.26% as of August 8, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.6 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 5 basis points to 1.69%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 23 basis points to 3.95%, while the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) decreased 32 basis points to 7.05%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers decreased 17 basis points to 3.46%,  and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased 13 basis points to 3.36%.
“The largest decrease in a month in the share of loans in forbearance came from a jump in forbearance  exits, as many homeowners are nearing the end of their forbearance terms. The forbearance share  declined for all investor and servicer categories,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and  Chief Economist. “New forbearance requests picked up slightly this week, particularly for Ginnie Mae  loans, but overall trends remain positive. Incoming data continues to support our forecast of an  improving job market in the months ahead.”

Active Listings in July 2021 were 3,719, down 23.4% from 4,853 in July 2020.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of August 13th, inventory was at 422 thousand (7 day average), compared to 602 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 29.8%.


A week ago, inventory was at 412 thousand, and was down 32.8% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 37.7% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of about 19% from the low).  


So inventory is less than half of what we&#x27;d normally expect, however inventory has increased (as a percentage) more than normal.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - back to the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.</span>

                    <span>Over the past three decades, post-crisis inflation in OECD economies has only picked up once the gap between current wages and peak pre-crisis wages has closed. This column explores the role of the cumulative wage gap in driving inflation, with a particular focus on Covid-19. The authors argue that the increase in inflation in recent months, which appears driven by one-off increases in income and supply bottlenecks, will not be sustained, as long as the as cumulative wage gaps remain wide.</span>

This column investigates the effect of one of history’s longest-running and most intrusive forms of religious persecution – the Spanish Inquisition. In areas without measured persecution, annual GDP per capita is significantly higher than in areas where the Inquisition was most active. Local levels of persecution continue to influence economic activity and basic attitudes some 200 years after the abolition of the Inquisition, undermining trust, reducing investments in human capital, and impoverishing hardest-hit areas.</span>

                    <span>Despite the commonly held views of economists on regulatory capture, our profession has been much more hesitant in recognising similar conflicts of interests that may exist in economics research. This column reports on the related discussions and research presented at the second London Political Finance (POLFIN) workshop, including work on the interaction between political power and corporate favouritism, the influence of partisanship on international capital flows, and political polarisation in financial news as well as in corporate boards. It lays out some of the important takeaways and suggests directions for further research that can shed light on the remaining issues.</span>

                    <span>Experts currently think we need somewhere between 70% and 85% of the total population fully vaccinated to achieve &quot;herd immunity&quot;.  Vermont has the highest percentage of fully vaccinated at 67.0% - so there is a long way to go.

The 7-day average cases is the highest since February 5th.


The 7-day average hospitalizations is the highest since February 14th.
The 7-day average deaths is the highest since May 14th.

This data is from the CDC.

                    <span>There are multiple mechanisms that drive aggregate increasing returns to scale. This column argues that the higher aggregate efficiency in larger markets may principally arise from a ‘Darwinian effect’ that causes high-markup firms to expand relative to low-markup firms as market size increases. This effect, which does not depend on the shape of the demand curve, means that additional firm entry can be valuable because it helps mitigate cross-sectional misallocation. Policymakers can harness this effect by incentivising entry, for example with a subsidy on entry costs.</span>

The total number of active plans declined by 83,000 since last Tuesday, pushing the total number of homeowners in forbearance below 1.8 million for the first time since early in the pandemic.

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic hit some firms and sectors especially hard. As economies bounce back, a key question is whether the recovery will re-employ all of the workers shed during the downturn, and whether they will go back to similar jobs. Using data from the Decision Maker Panel survey of UK businesses and the Survey of Business Uncertainty in the US, this column examines the ongoing impact of the Covid shock on cross-firm resource reallocation, summing the pandemic’s effects thus far and firms’ expectations for future reallocation of jobs and sales. The combined backward and forward-looking rate of job reallocation has roughly doubled in both countries, and sales reallocation has risen by even more, particularly in the UK. Businesses expect this accelerated pace of reallocation to persist into 2022, which raises the chance that mismatch unemployment will slow recovery in the medium term.</span>

전설적인 투자가 피터 린치는 이런 말을 했다. “주식을 공부하지 않고 투자하는 것은, 카드를 보지 않고 포커를 치는 것과 같다.” 주식시장이 어떻게 움직이는지, 그리고 투자하려는 기업이 어떤 성격을 지녔는지 모르는 채로 투자한다면 눈을 감고 경기에 참여하는 것만큼 위험하다는 뜻이다. 

그러나 주식을 처음 시작하는 사람들은 대부분 주식을 공부하지 않고 남들이 추천하는 종목을 무작정 따라 산다. 언제 공부를 해서, 언제 수익을 내느냐는 조급한 마음 때문이다. 게다가 유튜브, 블로그 등 주식 정보는 어디를 가나 넘쳐흐르니, 스스로 판단하기보다 고수들의 의견을 따르는 것이 더 현명한 투자일 것 같다. 하지만 과연 이러한 정보들을 무작정 모으고, 남들이 추천하는 종목을 따라 산다고 수익을 낼 수 있을까?

저자 권순우는 경제 유튜브 ‘삼프로TV’와 KBS1 라디오 ‘성공예감 김방희입니다’에서 주식시장에서 일어나는 다양한 이슈의 맥락을 날카롭게 짚어주면서 주식 투자자들의 열렬한 신뢰를 얻고 있는 경제부 기자다. 그는 “주식 투자에서 가장 중요한 것은 정보의 맥락을 이해하는 것”이라고 강조한다. 아무리 양질의 정보가 있다 해도 주식 투자를 전체적으로 바라보는 밑그림이 없다면 올바로 해석하고 적용할 수 없기 때문이다.

자료 구조를 좀 더 쉽게 공부하기 위해 단순히 자료 구조의 구현에 집중하기보다는 “인덱스는 어떻게 작동하기에 데이터베이스의 성능을 좋게 만들 수 있을까?”라는 한 가지 질문을 던져 놓고 이 질문의 답을 찾아가는 과정을 담았다. 모든 자료 구조를 다루진 않지만 이 과정에서 다룰 수 있는 여러 가지 자료 구조를 배우며, 개념을 확장해 나가는 방식으로 설명한다. 

빅오, 재귀 함수에서부터 다양한 그래프 알고리즘까지 그림 184개로 필수 자료 구조의 핵심 개념을 익힌 후 파이썬으로 구현한 코드도 직접 확인하고 실행해 볼 수 있다. 또한, 실제 자료 구조를 어디에 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지도 엿볼 수 있다. 이 책이 자료 구조를 학습하려는 분들에게 시작점이자 다른 유명한 자료 구조 책을 볼 수 있게 해주는 징검다리 역할을 해줄 것이다.

《Do it! 클론 코딩 영화 평점 웹서비스》 출간 이후 1년 만에 &#x27;트위터&#x27;를 클론하는 책이 나왔다. 첫 번째 책 출간 이후 &#x27;다른 웹 서비스도 클론하고 싶다&#x27;는 독자의 요청이 많았다. 이에 노마드 코더는 책을 만들기 위해 &#x27;트위터 클론 코딩&#x27;을 촬영을 마치고 전체 강의를 무료로 전환했다. 노마드 코더는 &quot;HTML, CSS, 자바스크립트, 리액트, 파이어베이스까지 프런트엔드부터 백엔드 개발 과정을 모두 포함한 알찬 강의임에도 지식 나눔을 위해 과감하게 결단을 내렸다&quot;고 했다. 

해당 강의는 현재 10,000명이 넘는 수강자를 기록하고 있으며, 강의를 통해 &#x27;실제 웹 서비스를 만들어 제공할 수 있게 되었다&#x27;는 훈훈한 후기가 많다. 넷플릭스와 비슷한 영화 평점 웹 서비스를 만들든, 트위터를 만들든 상관없다. 어떤 클론 코딩 책이든 관심이 있는 서비스로 웹 개발에 입문해 보자.

                    <span>A combination of empirical facts and economic theory suggest rising employer concentration contributed to wage stagnation in industrialized economies. Economic theory shows how labor market concentration can suppress wages by reducing workers’ bargaining leverage vis-à-vis powerful employers. Empirical evidence suggests that labor markets have become more concentrated since the late 20th century, shifting from a […]

저자가 그간 국책연구기관에서 수행했던 연구와 정부정책 수립 경험, 대학에서 경제정책론을 강의하면서 공부했던 내용에 바탕을 두고 정리한 책이다. 전통적인 학문과 정책의 세계를 넘나들면서 인적자원을 ‘시간, 공간, 인간’의 3간이 서로 융합되는 간학문적인 관점에서 논의한다. 인적자원으로서 사람의 역량을 기르는 것뿐만 아니라 길러진 역량을 활용하는 것도 중요하게 다룬다. 특히 한 인간의 삶 전체를 인적자원의 관점에서 조망한다.

현대 소프트웨어는 하드웨어의 성능 발전에 힘입어 많은 부분에서 추성화된 덕택에 코딩에 입문하기도 쉬워졌고 원하는 프로그램을 만들기도 쉬워졌다. 하지만 컴퓨터를 더 잘 이해하고 싶고 프로그래밍을 더 잘 하고 싶은 사람들에게는 불투명한 벽이 생긴 셈이다. 이 책은 그 어떤 다른 도구나 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 인터프리터, 컴파일러, 가상머신을 직접 구현해보며 추상화라는 벽 뒤에서 실제로 일어나고 있는 일들을 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다.

《밑바닥부터 만드는 인터프리터 in Go》의 후속편. 인터프리터와 컴파일러의 가장 큰 차이점은 중간코드, 즉 목적코드의 존재 유무에 있다. 전편처럼 테스트 주도 개발 방법을 이용해, 컴파일러의 작은 부품에서부터 시작하여 점차 고급 기능으로 확장해간다. 

이런 전개의 장점은 컴파일러의 구조와 코드를 독자가 매우 쉽게 이해하게 된다는 점입니다. 레고 부품을 조립해 하나의 완성된 테마를 만들 때처럼, 구현물이 테스트를 통과할 때마다 컴파일러의 동작 원리를 깨치는 재미가 제법 쏠쏠하다.

드래곤북 류의 방대한 이론을 담은 책도, 50줄의 코드로 장난감 같은 인터프리터를 뚝딱 만드는 블로그 수준의 글을 모아놓은 책도 아니다. 저자는 그 중간 어느 지점에서 이론보다는 구현을, 여러 기능의 나열보다는 인터프리터를 제대로 이해하기 위한 본질적이면서 교육적인 기능에 초점을 맞추어 책을 집필하였다.

사상 최악의 주가 폭락은 과연 코로나 팬데믹 탓인가? 그렇지 않다. 이미 주가가 최대치로 부풀어 올랐기 때문에 터진 것일 뿐이다. 버블의 진리. 한껏 부풀어오르면 그다음에는 터질 일만 남는다. 코로나는 계기일 뿐이었다. 그런데 각국 정부는 다시금 양적 완화로 경제위기를 틀어막았다. 그로 인해 또 다른 버블이 생겼다. 이제 막다른 길이 코앞에 다가왔다. 코로나 이후 우리는 어떻게 해야 할까? 

일본 경제학계의 대표 석학이자 행동파 경제학자인 오바타 세키 교수는 코로나 이후 혼란스러운 경제상황을 냉정히 분석하고 앞으로의 변화를 날카롭게 예측한다. 아무도 경험하지 못한 &#x27;애프터 코로나&#x27;의 세계는 어떻게 변화해 갈까? 앞으로 세계경제는 성장할까, 아니면 버블의 최종 국면으로 터져버리고 말까?
 
저자는 근대 자본주의가 연명할 수 있을지, 정부와 개인이 더 나은 세상을 위해 무엇을 해야 하는지 놀랍도록 직관적인 통찰과 대담한 솔루션을 제시한다. 저자의 통찰을 따라가다 보면 일본 경제를 넘어 &#x27;포스트 코로나&#x27; 시대 세계 경제가 나아갈 방향을 알려주는 이정표를 만날 수 있을 것이다.

프롤로그 버블이 만들어낸 경제성장, 버블이 파괴한 경제성장
버블 애프터 버블｜근대 자본주의는 버블이다｜버블의 세 가지 순환｜경제성장은 버블의 확대｜
코로나 위기와 버블의 마지막 국면

제1장 버블 애프터 버블의 30년_사상 최악의 주가 폭락은 왜 일어났는가
코로나 위기와 주가 대폭락은 무관하다｜리먼 사태 후에 왜 다시 버블이?｜모든 시장에서 버블 발생｜냉전 종료와 30년 버블｜시장 자본주의는 유동화를 통한 수탈이다｜버블에 이은 버블｜코로나 위기 버블｜실물경제 버블에서 시작된 재정파탄

제2장 코로나 위기는 사상 최대급 위기인가_&#x27;급변하는 사회&#x27;는 있을 수 없다
애프터 코로나는 없다｜대공황이 아니라 마지막 버블이 다가온다｜&#x27;평범한&#x27; 불황에 그친다｜스톡 쇼크가 아닌 플로 쇼크｜공급 쇼크는 존재하지 않는다｜이기주의에서 비롯된 마스크 문제｜끄떡없는 금융시스템｜정크본드 버블과 금융위기｜버블이 &#x27;또&#x27;&#x27;다시&#x27; 찾아왔다

제3장 모든 가격은 버블이다_원유 선물 -40달러는 무엇을 의미하는가
전대미문의 원유 선물 마이너스 가격｜수요와 구매는 별개｜원유의 적정가격은 없다｜원유가 비싼 것은 우연의 일치다｜금도 다이아몬드도 가치는 없다｜가치가 없는 것일수록 비싸진다｜금은 가격 상승으로 가치를 잃었다｜가격이 오르는 것이 리스크｜산업구조를 결정짓는 것은 가격｜가격 설정 혼란이 가져온 것｜가격은 대부분 버블

제4장 새로운 차원의 금융정책이 필요하다_양적 완화는 시대착오
전무후무한 경제 대책｜불요불급은 불요｜기업이 아닌 사람을 지킨다｜대기업이 아닌, 사람과 경제를 지킨다｜코로나 이전의 관광은 버블이었다｜금융정책의 근본적인 변경｜부채의 화폐화는 이미 시작되었다｜양의 세 가지 해로움｜인플레는 일어나지 않고 일으킬 수도 없다｜새로운 차원의 금융완화｜금융정책은 자산시장도 타깃으로｜리스크프리미엄 타깃

제5장 &#x27;안심&#x27; 신화가 재정을 파탄으로 내몬다_코로나 대책이 산으로 가는 이유
코로나 리스크는 제로가 될 수 없다｜제로 리스크 신화｜안심을 위해 안전을 희생하는 나라｜제로 리스크 지향에 의한 사고 정지｜전 국민 PCR 검사는 왜 틀렸는가｜검사가 안심을 가져다주지는 않는다｜거리 두기의 세 가지 행동 패턴｜...

부동산 중개업 시장에서 최고 난이도는 빌딩 시장이다. 그만큼 누구나 하고 싶어 하지만 아무나 도전할 수 없는 영역이기도 하다. 현재 주택에 대한 대출이 막혔고, 다주택자 및 고급주택에 대한 고세율 부가정책 등 주택을 투자재로서 매력을 잃게 만든 여러 규제로 인해 꼬마빌딩 투자 시장이 화두가 되고 있다. 이처럼 경기불황 속 빌딩매매에 대한 관심은 꾸준히 이어질 것으로 예상된다. 

이 책에서는 주택이 없는 근린생활시설 꼬마빌딩의 매매에 관해 다루었다. 빌딩 매입 사전지식부터 필수 실무지식을 거쳐 구매 이후 관리까지 건물 투자와 관련한 저자만의 실전 경험과 지식 노하우를 아낌없이 담았다. 학군, 교통, 편의시설, 집값을 주도하는 서울 강남구 지역을 전격 분석했으며, 책 속 지도에는 QR코드를 삽입하여 해당 위치를 그 자리에서 바로 살펴볼 수 있다. 부동산 전문가의 시선에서 바라본 빌딩매매 시장을 디테일하게 분석하여 ‘전문성’도 살렸다. 부디 부동산 재테크에 뛰어든 초보 투자자들에게 이해하기 쉽고 술술 읽히는 책이 되길 바란다.

fastai 라이브러리는 딥러닝 응용에 일관된 인터페이스를 최초로 제공하며 &#x27;모두를 위한 딥러닝&#x27;을 가능하게 한다. 이제 더 이상 딥러닝은 구글, 페이스북, 마이크로소프트 등 거대 기술 기업의 전유물이 아니다. 파이썬에 친숙한 프로그래머라면 약간의 수학적 배경지식, 소규모 데이터, 짧은 코드만으로도 딥러닝을 구현하는 놀라운 경험을 얻을 수 있다. 이 책에서 fastai 라이브러리의 창시자인 제러미와 실뱅은 fastai와 파이토치로 다양한 작업에 대한 모델을 학습시키는 방법을 소개한다. 또한 내부적인 알고리즘을 완전히 이해하는 데 필요한 딥러닝 이론도 설명한다.

신(新)중국 성립부터 지금까지의 중국 국가발전전략과 규획의 수립 및 실행적 과정을 돌이켜 보며, 국제적인 시각과 시대의 변화에 끊임없이 동조하는 자세로 그 중의 경험과 교훈에 대하여 평가와 총결을 진행하는 책이다. 국가발전전략의 분석 방면에서 저자는 전략적 패러다임 및 유파의 개념을 제시하였고, 이를 근거로 중국과 외국의 전략 유형에 대해 이론적 귀납을 진행하였으며 새로운 시대적 관점에서 앞으로의 중국 국가발전전략의 선택 및 방향을 분석하였다.

국가발전규획의 분석 방면에서 저자는 규획의 변천, 경험과 규획의 실행 과정에서 존재하는 문제를 실마리로 삼아 어떻게 국가규획사업의 품질을 제고하고, 규획체계를 완비할 것인지에 대해 연구하였는데 구체적으로 국가의 총체적 규획의 개선, 지역 규획의 완비와 그에 따른 기타 규획과의 관계, 시?현급(市縣級) 규획체제의 개혁, 주체기능구역 규획의 완비 및 규획의 법제화 등이다.

자본주의와 산업화의 역사를 꼼꼼히 살펴본다. 또한 이 현대문명의 사상적 · 기술적 기초가 된 다양한 철학자들과 과학자들의 영향과 기여들에 대해서도 소개한다. 이렇게 살펴본 산업자본주의의 발자취를 토대로, ‘스마트 공동체 사회’라는 희망적 대안을 제시한다. 

이곳은 욕망의 경제권력과 지식권력을 내려놓고 완전고용을 달성하여 빈부의 격차가 없고, 재화와 쾌락이 평등하게 분배되는 사회이다. 이 사회는 인류의 밝은 미래를 가져오기 위해 스마트주의에 입각하여 발전된 기술혁신의 인공지능, 생명공학, 그리고 로봇이 현생인류의 생존을 위협하지 않고 인간을 위해 봉사하고, 지구환경을 회복시켜 이룩한 지속가능의 미래가 보장되는 사회이다. 

인류가 역사를 시작하며 끊임없이 질문해온 ‘어떻게 하면 자연재해, 전쟁, 기아, 질병이 사라진 이상향을 만들 수 있을까?’ 하는 물음에 대한 해답의 실마리를 이 책을 통해 찾아볼 수 있을 것이다.

코로나 팬데믹이 세계 경제시장을 휩쓸고 있다. 한국경제라고 하여 예외는 아니다. 전 세계 사람들의 국가 간 이동이 막혔다. 세계 모든 나라들이 빗장을 걸어 잠그고 자국의 이익 여하에 따라 이합집산한다. 세계 경제의 패권싸움이 새로운 국면을 맞고 있는 것이다. 이 책은 4차 산업혁명 시대의 도래, 코로나 팬데믹 후 세계 그리고 20대 대선 등 굵직한 선택의 기로에 놓인 한국경제에 대한 전망서다.

투자은행 골드만삭스는 2050년 한국경제 규모가 세계 5위권에 진입할 것으로 예측했다. 새로운 10년 안에 과연 무엇이, 어떻게, 얼마나 빨리, 얼마만큼 변할 것인가? 우리는 무엇을 준비하고, 어떻게 대응해야 하는가? 이는 우리나라와 사회의 ‘지속 가능한 생존’ 문제와 직결된다. 

저자는 국민 화해, 통합과 공존과 경제, 교육, 외교 혁명을 통해 경제성장의 속도를 높인다면 이를 15년 빨리 2030년대까지 달성할 수 있을 것이라 본다. 그가 제안하는 10년 후 한국, 우리가 선택해야 할 3가지 핵심이슈를 알아본다.

4차 산업혁명은 시간과 공간의 경계를 허물고, 금융시장의 국제화도 가속화하였다. 투자의사결정은 장기적이고, 전략적인 의사결정이다. 국내시장만 바라볼 것이 아니라 국제금융시장을 이해하고, 해석할 수 있는 힘을 키워야 투자에 성공할 수 있다. 누구나 아는 투자의 기본원칙은 있다. 분산투자, 장기투자 등이 그것이다. 이러한 기본원칙들에 대한 기초적인 이론들을 정리한 책이다. 이러한 이론들은 실제 국제금융투자에서 접하는 질문들에 대한 답을 찾는 데 필요한 필수적인 틀을 제공할 것이다.

21세기의 극적인 자산불평등은 최근 그 어느 때보다 많은 논쟁의 대상이 되고 있다. 세계적으로 자산집중은 점차 거대해지는 추세이다. 수많은 사람들이 하루 1달러로 생계를 유지하는 동안 극소수의 과도한 부자들이 수백억 달러의 자산을 소유하고 있는 상황은 감정적 동요를 불러일으킨다. 

정치가 부자들의 자산집중에 소극적으로 대응하고 부자들에게 유리한 감정정치를 펼친 결과 사람들은 과도한 부자들의 특혜를 수용하는 경향을 갖게 된다. 질투와 증오는 가난한 사람들의 몫이 되고 아량과 동정은 부자들의 미덕이 된다. 그러나 부유한 자들의 박애주의는 과도한 부의 사회적 문제를 보이지 않게끔 만든다. 정의로운 사회를 바라는 사람이라면 자산집중 현상이 어떻게 인식되는지를 이해해야 한다. 과도한 부는 정의원칙을 훼손할 뿐만 아니라 민주주의를 위협하기 때문이다. 

그렇다면 과도한 부에 대항하여 일보 전진하는 방법은 무엇일까? 가난한 사람들의 자산자료는 여러 곳에서 얻을 수 있는 반면, 과도한 부자들의 자산자료는 아주 기초적인 정보조차 숨겨져 있는 상황이다. 저자 마르틴 쉬르츠는 편중된 부에 대한 올바른 논의가 사회적으로 일어나기 위한 선결조건으로서 명확한 자산자료의 확보를 제시한다.

그리고 이를 통해 경제적 불평등에 대한 논의를 활성화시키고자 한다. 한편 이 책은 부유함이라는 딱딱한 주제를 다루면서도 여러 시대를 아우르는 철학자, 문학가들을 소환하여 부유함을 주제로 이야기를 나누는 것도 충분히 즐거운 경험이 될 수 있음을 우리에게 보여 준다.

코로나19 팬데믹은 정말 많은 것들을 바꿔놓았다. 어떤 개인과 기업들은 어쩌면 21세기에 처음이자 마지막으로 부자가 될 기회를 맞이했을 것이고, 또 어떤 개인과 기업들은 전혀 생각지도 못했던 위기를 맞아야 했다. 이는 국가도 마찬가지다. 

저자인 곽수종 박사는 코로나19 팬데믹으로 인해 국가도 무한경쟁 시대를 맞이하게 됐다고 말한다. 이 변화에 빠르게 대처하지 못한다면 대한민국은 글로벌 경쟁에서 뒤처지게 된다는 것이다. 시대의 역동성을 자연스러운 성장과 발전 과정으로 이해하고 반응하는 법을 익히는 것이 무엇보다 중요하다고 말한다.

이 책은 시대의 변화와 목표를 이해하기 위해 인문학적으로도 접근한다. 미국의 독립전쟁 이후 미국이 주도한 ‘국가와 시민의 변화’, 일본 메이지유신으로 대변되는 ‘개혁적 변화’, 뉴질랜드의 ‘위에서 아래로의 변화’를 살펴본다. 

각국의 시대적 상황과 그에 따른 변화와 개혁의 과정을 살펴보면서 대한민국의 현재 상황을 점검하고 변화의 방향을 가늠할 수 있을 것이다. 글로벌 질서 전환의 시대에 대한민국의 현재 좌표는 물론 기업과 개개인이 나아가야 할 방향을 이해하며 경쟁력을 갖추는 데 이 책이 도움이 될 것이다.

들어가는 말 한국경제의 미래를 말한다

프로그래머는 동작하는 코드를 작성하는 법은 알지만, 그저 동작만 한다는 사실은 알지 못한다. 잘 작성된 코드, 이해하기 쉬운 코드, 요구사항의 균형점에 있는 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법은 대부분 알지 못한다. 이 책에서는 동작하는 코드가 아니라 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법을 설명한다. 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법을 하나씩 익히다 보면 수습생에서 전문가로 변화할 수 있을 것이다.

코드를 작성하는 일관된 스타일을 익히는 것이 중요하다. 코드의 표현 스타일, 변수 이름 짓기, 오류 처리, 보안 같이 코딩에 필요한 요소들을 익혀서 정말 한 사람이 작성한 게 맞느냐는 얘기는 듣지 않게 하자. 전반부가 코드 작성 그 자체에 대한 이야기라면 후반부는 팀, 개발 프로세스, 명세서 작성, 팀 리뷰, 외부의 제약 조건을 다룬다. 훌륭한 코드는 프로그래머 개인의 코드 작성뿐 아니라 팀, 개발 프로세스, 명세서 작성, 팀 리뷰의 과정을 거친다는 사실을 놓치지 않는다.
