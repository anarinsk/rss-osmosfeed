                    <span>Previous research in economics has focused on the causes of conflict, while the ending of military interventions has received less attention. This column examines the recent security transition from international troops to local forces in the ongoing civil conflict in Afghanistan using declassified data on conflict outcomes and perceptions of local security. It finds that a decline in violence during the initial phase of the security transfer was followed by an upsurge in violence once foreign troops physically withdrew, suggesting that the Taliban’s attacks have been highly strategic.</span>

                    <span>Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 account for a large part of the resurgence of infections in many OECD countries since the latter part of 2020. By relating country-level daily reproduction numbers for OECD countries to several potential explanatory factors, this column shows that vaccination has been very effective at curbing COVID-19 infections and that a quick vaccine rollout can substitute for lockdown policies at much lower costs to the economy. However, policymakers should be aware that failure to vaccinate a sufficient share of the population could lead to a resurgence of the virus in the winter.</span>

                    <span>The Covid pandemic has helped to loosen the binds that previously tied a job to a specific geography and created a new class of work in the UK. ‘Anywhere jobs’ are non-routine service sector jobs that can be done from anywhere in the world, potentially for cheaper. This column shows that one in five workers in the UK are in an anywhere job and, in contrast to the past when the pressure was on semi-skilled workers, it is relatively highly skilled workers in non-routine roles that are now vulnerable to the pressures of technology and globalisation.</span>

                    <span>From the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Rail Time Indicators.  Graphs and excerpts reprinted with permission. 
U.S. rail volumes in June 2021 and Q2 2021 were consistent with an economy that’s growing but  has more growing to do. Total U.S. carloads in June 2021 and Q2 2021 were up 19.1% and 23.8%,  respectively, over the same periods in 2020 as easy comps led to big year-over-year percentage gains.  That said, total carloads in Q2 2021 were the most for any quarter since Q4 2019.
...
On the intermodal side, U.S. originations in Q2 2021 were the most ever for a quarter, and  intermodal volume in the first six months of 2021 were the most ever for the first six months of a year. 
   emphasis added
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
Total originated carloads were 1.18 million in  June 2021, up 19.1% (188,164 carloads) over June 2020  and down 5.5% from June 2019.
...
Carloads excluding coal were up 14.1% in June 2021 over June 2020 and down 4.3% from June 2019. 
The second graph shows the six week average of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
U.S. intermodal originations, which are not  included in carloads, rose 10.9% in June 2021 over June  2020, their 11th straight year-over-year gain. In June,  intermodal averaged 277,349 containers and trailers per  week, the second most for June on record (behind June  2018).</span>

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 0.1% compared to the same week in 2019 (easy comparison due to the timing of July 4th).  Leisure (weekend) occupancy has recovered, but weekday (more business) is still down.

From CoStar: STR: Weekly US Hotel Occupancy Dips as June Yields to July
U.S. hotel occupancy dipped while average daily rate (ADR) was up from previous weeks and the comparable period in 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through July 3.
June 27 through July 3, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 65.4% (-0.1%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$135.35 (+5.8%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$88.51 (+5.7%)
 While occupancy was down because of the holiday week, overall comparisons were more favorable because of low performance during the corresponding week from 2019. That week in 2019 was lower due to the 4th of July falling on a Thursday.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months should have decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.</span>

From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Significant Improvement in Active Forbearances
In our last post, we mentioned that last week’s minor reduction in forbearance plans had “set us up nicely for what could be a larger improvement next week as some 218,000 plans were still scheduled for review by Wednesday, June 30.”
Well, that larger improvement arrived this week.
Since last Tuesday, the overall number of active plans has dropped by 189,000, pushing the population of homeowners in forbearance down below 2 million for the first time early in April of last year.
The decline, as mentioned above, was driven by the large volume of early entrants reaching their 15-month quarterly review, and significant declines were seen across all investor classes.

Loans held in bank portfolios and private label securities led the way with a 78,000 reduction in plans, while FHA/VA and GSE forbearance volumes dropped by 67,000 and 44,000 respectively.
All in all, that puts us down 254,000 (-12%) from the same time last month.
  
Nearly two thirds of the more than 325,000 plans reviewed for extension or removal over the prior week resulted in exits. That’s the highest weekly exit rate in more than six months and the highest weekly removal volume since the first wave of plans went through their 12-month reviews a few months ago.
Forbearance plan starts also continue to fall, with both new and repeat starts down this week for a total of fewer than 26,000, a new pandemic-era low.
As of July 6, 1.86 million (3.5% of) homeowners remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans including 2.2% of GSE, 6.8% of FHA/VA and 4.6% of Portfolio/PLS loans. Another 400,000 plans are scheduled to be reviewed for extension/removal over the next 30 days.

                    <span>The economic shock triggered by Covid-19 shut down thousands of businesses and cost millions of workers their jobs. The goal of government response to this shock was simple: keep the lights on for as long as possible. This column describes how while some advanced economies have moved ahead with changes in their bankruptcy law to make it easier for distressed companies to keep running, developing countries have not reformed their procedures. A possible solution is to devise policies that reduce the share of the informal economy and put more pressure on reforming formal institutions.</span>

                    <span>Although epidemics are frequently cited as inducing changes in economic behaviour and accelerating technological and behavioural trends, there may be important differences across socioeconomic groups in ability to utilise such new technologies. This column studies these issues in the context of fintech adoption and finds strong evidence of epidemic-induced changes in economic and financial behaviour, of differences in the extent of such shifts by more and less economically advantaged individuals, and of a role for IT infrastructure in spreading or limiting the benefits of technological alternatives.  The results highlight both the behavioural response to epidemics and the digital divide.</span>

                    <span>If economists are going to be able to offer clear guidance about the appropriate ambition of climate change policy, we need firmer damage estimates. This column introduces a new model that prices farmers’ ex-post and ex-ante adaptations to weather changes and forecasts. When applied to US agriculture, the model shows a much more pessimistic outcome than currently expected, and encourages the consideration of substantial changes to agricultural policies.</span>

                    <span>From the NMHC: NMHC Rent Payment Tracker
The National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC)’s Rent Payment Tracker found 76.5 percent of apartment households made a full or partial rent payment by July 6 in its survey of 11.7 million units of professionally managed apartment units across the country.
  
This is a 0.9 percentage point decrease from the share who paid rent through July 6, 2020 and compares to 79.7 percent that had been paid by July 6, 2019. This data encompasses a wide variety of market-rate rental properties across the United States, which can vary by size, type and average rental price.

This graph from the NMHC Rent Payment Tracker shows the percent of household making full or partial rent payments by the 6th of the month compared to 2019 and to the first COVID year. 

Although payments are down from 2019, rent payments are mostly unchanged from last year.
This is mostly for large, professionally managed properties.
The second graph shows full month payments through June compared to the same month the prior year.

For June, rent payments were down compared to June 2019 and 2020.

CR Note: There are some timing issues month to month.</span>

                    <span>From Dodge Data Analytics: Dodge Momentum Index Loses Steam In June
 Following six months of consecutive gains, the Dodge Momentum Index fell to 165.8 (2000&#x3D;100) in June, down 5% from the revised May reading of 175.1. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Data &amp; Analytics, is a monthly measure of the first (or initial) report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year.
  
The decline in June was the result of losses in both institutional planning, which fell 7%, and commercial planning, which lost 4%.
  
Uncertain demand for some building types (such as retail and hotels), higher material prices, and continued labor shortages are weighing down new project planning. Even with June’s decline, however, the Momentum Index remains near a 13-year high and well above last year. Compared to a year earlier, both commercial and institutional planning were significantly higher than in June 2020 (39% and 46% respectively). Overall, the Momentum Index was 41% higher.

This graph shows the Dodge Momentum Index since 2002. The index was at 165.8 in June, down from 175.1 in May.
According to Dodge, this index leads &quot;construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year&quot;.  This index suggests a decline in Commercial Real Estate construction through most of 2021, but a pickup towards the end of the year, and growth in 2022 (even with the decline in the June index).</span>

우리는 부동산 문제 해결이 그저 ‘정책’으로는 되지 않는다는 사실을 깨달아야 한다. 오늘날 한국 사회는 부동산으로 이득을 보는 걸 당연시하며, 그런 관점 아래 법제도와 사회구조 및 관습 등이 구성돼 있다. 한마디로 이것은 ‘체제’의 문제인 것이다. 그리하여 한국은 ‘불로소득 유발형 부동산체제’가 굳게 자리잡고 말았다. 당연히 한두 가지 정책 도입만으로 이런 체제는 꿈쩍도 하지 않는다. 분명한 철학과 확고한 원칙, 그리고 체계적이고 종합적인 정책 패키지가 결합된 토탈 솔루션이 필요하다. 이 책 『불로소득 환수형 부동산체제론』은 체제의 관점에서 부동산 문제에 접근한 최초의 시도로, 부동산체제의 코페르니쿠스적 전환을 제안하고 있다.

&#x27;중국 특색의 사회주의&#x27;가 신시대에 접어들면서 아름다운 생활을 갈망하는 인민들의 요구는 날고 강렬해졌고, 날로 광범해졌다. 동시에 발전 불균형과 불충분으로 나타난 문제들을 해결하지 못했기에 발전 품질과 효익이 높지 못했다. 민생영역에는 아직도 많은 단점들이 있다. 사회문명은 향상되어야 하고 사회모순과 문제도 중첩되어 있다. 이 책은 시진핑 신시대 &#x27;중국 특색의 사회주의&#x27; 사상 연구를 담았다.

제1장 경제체제 개혁을 끝까지 진행하자
 1. 경제체제 개혁은 중국의 모습을 변화시켰다
  (1) 개혁은 중국경제 총량이 부단히 새로운 단계에 오르도록 했다
  (2) 개혁은 인민들의 생활을 최저생활 수준에서 전면적인 샤오캉사회로 발전시켰다
  (3) 개혁은 중국의 국제경쟁력을 현저하게 향상시켰다
  (4) 중요 영역과 관건적인 부분에서의 개혁은 돌파적인 진척을 가져왔다
 2. 개혁은 이미 관건적인 단계에 진입했다
  (1) 중국의 경제성장은 여전히 체제적 요소의 영향을 크게 받고 있다
  (2) 점진적 개혁에서 전면적 개혁의 심화로
  (3) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 일부 사람들의 이익을 건드릴 수 있다
 3. 반드시 실속 있게 개혁을 추진해야 한다
  (1) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 혁명과도 같은 것이기에 반드시 실속 있게 진행해야 한다
  (2) 개혁을 돌파할 수 있는 관건은 실시하는 데에 있다
  (3) 개혁을 하려는 자를 등용하고, 개혁을 하려하지 않는 자를 해임하는 인재등용의 방식을 지향해야 한다
 4. 오직 개혁개방 만이 중국을 발전시키고, 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다
  (1) 개혁개방은 백년 목표의 실현을 결정하는 관건이다
  (2) 경제체제 개혁은 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 중점이다
  (3) 발전을 포용하고 지속시키려면 개혁을 심화시키는 것에 의존해야 한다
  (4) 오직 개혁개방만이 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다

제2장 경제체제 개혁의 총체적 요구와 기본방향
 1. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키기 위한 총체적 요구
 2. 사회주의 공평 정의와 인민복지의 증진은 개혁의 출발점이고 목표점이다
 3. 사회주의 기본 경제제도를 견지하고 개선해야 한다
 4. 사회주의 시장경제의 개혁방향을 견지해야 한다
 5. 체제개혁의 목적과 조건
 6. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 노선도

제3장 정확하게 전면적으로 경제체제의 개혁을 심화시키기 위해서는 약간의 중대한 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 1. 사상해방과 실사구시의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 2. 신중하게 일을 처리하는 것과 상부 설계와의 관계를 잘 처리 해야 한다
 3. 증량을 추진하는 국부적인 개혁과 전면적으로 추진하는 전반적인 개혁과의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 4. 개혁ㆍ발전ㆍ안...

중국인민대학 과학연구처, 중국인민대학 국가발전과 전략연구원, 중국인민대학 “시진핑 신시대 ‘중국 특색의 사회주의’ 사상” 학습연구원 등이 공동으로 기획한 기구에서 중국인민대학 각 전공 별 영역의 전문가들을 모아 편찬했으며, 테마연구를 위해서는 국내 유관 연구기구의 연구원들을 모집했다. “시진핑 신시대 ‘중국 특색의 사회주의’ 사상”은 심오하고 내용도 풍부하므로 국내 학술계에서는 이 사상을 깊이 있게 연구해야 한다는 생각으로 이 사상을 연구하였다. 이렇게 하여 얻어낸 성과인 이 총서는 중국인민대학의 초보적인 결과물이라고 할 수 있다. 장차 중국인민대학은 중국인민대학 자체가 가지고 있는 전통적인 장점과 학과별 장점, 훌륭한 인재에 의지하여 이 사상을 더욱 깊이 있게 연구하여 더욱 우수한 연구 성과를 낼 수 있도록 당대 중국의 마르크스주의와 21세기 마르크스주의를 논술할 것을 기대해 마지않는다.

세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사까지 한 번에 명화로 쉽고 재미있고 빠르게 이해하는 경제 교양서. 역사를 잘 몰라도, 미술에 조예가 깊지 않아도, 경제 까막눈이어도 누구나 부담 없이 즐길 수 있는 명화 속 경쾌한 ‘경제’ 이야기. 재미있는 회계 강의로 유명한 현직 회계사인 저자답게 편안하고 재치있는 입담으로, 어렵게 느껴지던 세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사의 주요 흐름을 쉽고 재미있게 들려준다. 중세 이탈리아에서부터 현대 미국까지 가난과 역병, 전쟁, 혁명의 위기와 불안을 극복해온 각 나라의 경험은 물론, 화가들의 반전 있는 마케팅 전략같이 생각지 못한 미술과 관련된 경제 이야기가 경쾌하게 펼쳐진다. 또 수없이 많은 위기를 되풀이해온 역사 속 인간의 다양한 경제 활동과 명화에 담긴 사람들의 욕망과 지혜에서 불안의 시대를 살아나갈 용기와 희망을 찾아볼 수 있다.

약 30년을 경제부처에 몸담았던 신윤수 저자의 정치·사회에 관한 세 번째 도서. 현재 우리 사회의 문제들을 꼬집으며 어떻게 하면 더 좋은 사회로 발전할 수 있을지, 자유민주주의, 시장경제와 ‘행복한 나라’를 위한 제언을 담았다. 이 시대에 가장 뜨거운 이슈인 ‘기본소득’을 포함하여 사회의 다양한 방향에 대한 의견을 네 파트로 나눠 이야기한다. 중간중간 저자가 직접 쓴 시도 함께 실었다.

                    <span>COVID-19 caused a “recession like no other”, which triggered an unprecedented economic policy response in the EU. As the European Commission’s Summer 2021 Economic Forecast points to a quick return to the pre-pandemic output levels, attention shifts to the post-pandemic years. Will the recovery be short-lived, or will the COVID-19 crisis prove to be a transformative event for the EU? Much will depend on the course of economic policy in the years ahead. NextGenerationEU, with its centrepiece the Recovery and Resilience Facility, provides a unique possibility to turn the challenges of the crisis into opportunities. The first set of National Recovery and Resilience Plans give reason for optimism, but much will depend on their implementation by the member states.</span>

                    <span>Central banks are thinking about whether they should substitute publicly issued digital currency for the bank-issued digital money that people use every day. How this plays out can profoundly reshape the financial system and make it less stable. This column argues that we don’t need CBDC to solve financial system problems, but with China already headed down the CBDC road, perhaps the best hope is that central banks will all proceed very slowly and stop well short of universal, elastically supplied, interest-bearing digital currency.</span>

                    <span>Financial stability is at the core of central banking. This column assesses the various risks to financial stability stemming from climate change, which arise from physical risks, transition risks, and the chosen transition path towards a net zero economy. Additional risks arise from the changes in government policies, risks in green investments, mispricing of assets, and potential changes in metrics. The channels for financial instability are, as usual, the sustainability of government debt, the vulnerability of banking, and the volatility and liquidity of securities markets. Awareness of these additional financial stability risks could increase financial stability.</span>

In discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook, participants commented that the process of reopening the economy was unprecedented and likely to be uneven across sectors. Some participants judged that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages complicated the task of assessing progress toward the Committee&#x27;s goals and that the speed at which these factors would dissipate was uncertain. Accordingly, participants judged that uncertainty around their economic projections was elevated. Although they generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced, a substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projectio…</span>

                    <span>From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings was little changed at 9.2 million on the last business day of May, the U.S.  Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires were little changed at 5.9 million. Total separations  decreased to 5.3 million. Within separations, the quits rate decreased to 2.5 percent. The layoffs and  discharges rate, while little changed over the month, hit a series low of 0.9 percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for May, the most recent employment report was for June.
 Click on graph for larger image.
Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spikes in layoffs and discharges in March and April 2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings increased in May to 9.209 million from 9.193 million in April.  This is a new record high for this series.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 69% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 63% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for &quot;quits&quot;).</span>

But during the autumn of 2020 this number grew substantially, a trend that continued through the winter months and warrants the attention of policymakers.</span>

                    <span>(Posted with permission).  The June ISM® Services index was at 60.1%, up from 64.0% last month. The employment index decreased to 49.3%, from 55.3%.  Note: Above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction. 
From the Institute for Supply Management: June 2021 Services ISM® Report On Business® 
Economic activity in the services sector grew in June for the 13th month in a row, say the nation’s purchasing and supply executives in the latest Services ISM® Report On Business®.
The report was issued today by Anthony Nieves, CPSM, C.P.M., A.P.P., CFPM, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management® (ISM®) Services Business Survey Committee: “The Services PMI registered 60.1 percent, which is 3.9 percentage points lower than May’s all-time high reading of 64 percent. The June reading indicates the 13th straight month of growth for the services sector, which has expanded for all but two of the last 137 months.
“The Supplier Deliveries Index registered 68.5 percent, down 1.9 percentage points from May’s reading of 70.4 percent. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM® Report On Business® index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Prices Index registered 79.5 percent, 1.1 percentage points lower than the May reading of 80.6 percent, indicating that prices increased in June, and at a slightly slower rate.
“According to the Services PMI®, 16 services industries reported growth. The composite index indicated growth for the 13th consecutive month after a two-month contraction in April and May 2020. The rate of expansion in the services sector remains strong, despite the slight pullback in the rate of growth from the previous month’s all-time high. Challenges with materials shortages, inflation, logistics and employment resources continue to be an impediment to business conditions,” says Nieves.

The employment index decreased to 49.3%, from 55.3% in May.</span>

Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $76.62 per barrel and Brent at $77.45 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $41, and Brent was at $43 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 90% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic).

                    <span>Inflation shortfalls across the developed world have raised concerns about the possibility of low-inflation traps. This column presents a simple model of inflation to analyse the role of stabilisation policy in preventing them. It suggests that decisive countercyclical fiscal policy can protect economies from falling into a low-inflation trap by offsetting low inflation expectations.</span>

                    <span>The G7 recently reached an agreement on the taxation of multinational corporations. The IGM Forum at Chicago Booth invited its panels of leading European and US economists to express their views on the challenges ahead. As this column reports, a strong majority (94% of the panelists) agrees that a global minimum corporate tax rate would limit the benefits of profit-shifting to low-tax jurisdictions without biasing where firms invest. But there is considerably more uncertainty among respondents about whether an international tax system with such a global minimum is achievable; and whether taxes based on where firms make their sales would be more efficient than taxes based on where their headquarters and production are located.</span>

Analyzing June new home sales &amp; pricing figures from our monthly builder survey. As one builder noted: “It’s not fun to be a builder anymore.” Lumber relief is nice but pick your poison on other issues. Market commentary from across the country to follow... 
#Richmond builder: “It&#x27;s not fun to be a builder anymore. Cost pressure is killing us. Not only will builders like myself who take 12-24 months to build a house lose margin from increases, but the affordability is becoming a major issue.” 
#Atlanta builder: “Costs have driven up prices &amp; we’re no longer preselling. We will not sell a home until frame stage, so our sales numbers are off for June while awaiting framing stage.”

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of July 2nd, inventory was at 373 thousand (7 day average), compared to 666 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 44.0%.


A week ago, inventory was at 359 thousand, and was down 46.9% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 21.8% above the record low in early April.

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases, although still well below a normal rate for June.</span>

                    <span>The employment diffusion indexes are useful in gauging how widespread job gains are in a given month.

The BLS diffusion index for total private employment was at 66.1 in June, up from 63.0 in May.
For manufacturing, the diffusion index was at 62.0, down from 63.3 in May.
Think of this as a measure of how widespread job gains or losses are across industries. The further from 50 (above or below), the more widespread the job losses or gains reported by the BLS.  From the BLS: 
Figures are the percent of industries with employment increasing plus one-half of the industries with unchanged employment, where 50 percent indicates an equal balance between industries with increasing and decreasing employment.

Both indexes declined sharply in March 2020, and collapsed to new record lows in April 2020 due to the impact from COVID-19.  Then the indexes increased as the economy bounced back.

Both indexes were solid in June, indicating job growth was widespread across industries.</span>

미국의 노동 운동가이자 작가인 리오 휴버먼은 “역사책에는 이런저런 왕들의 야망과 정복 그리고 전쟁에 관한 이야기가 장황하게 이어지는데, 왕들의 이야기보다는 왕권 배후에 있는 진정한 힘, 곧 그 시대의 상인과 금융업자의 이야기에 지면을 할애하는 편이 훨씬 나았을 것이다”라고 말했다.세계 역사를 이끌어온 힘은, 왕이 아닌 상인과 금융업자에게서 나왔다는 얘기다. 실제로 세계를 뒤흔든 전환점이라 일컫는 포르투갈의 대항해, 네덜란드 중상주의 발흥, 영국의 산업혁명과 자본주의의 전개, 신대륙의 부흥, 미국의 눈부신 성장 등은 상인과 금융업자의 역사이자, 특히 유대인에 의해 시작되고 완성된 역사라는 사실을 부정할 사람은 없을 것이다. 『유대인 이야기』의 저자인 경제학자 홍익희는 자본주의를 탄생시키고 세계 경제를 이끌어온 유대인의 역사, 그 가운데서도 오늘날의 금융혁명을 일으키고 세계 산업을 재편한 로스차일드 가문에 주목하였다.

경제대항해 시대, 한국호를 둘러싼 조류와 파도, 바람, 비의 방향과 세기를 점검하고 향후 한국호의 최적 운항 전략과 방법론을 모색하고자 쓰였다. 최적의 솔루션은 외부 위기 요인과 내부 역량에 대한 엄격한 점검에서 나올 수밖에 없다. 따라서 저자는 ‘도전의 실체’와 ‘응전의 능력’을 함께 평가하는 지난한 작업을 벌이고 있다.저자는 지난 10여 년간 언론에 게재한 칼럼들을 주제별로 나눠 이 책에 수록하였다. 칼럼을 취사선택하지 않고 있는 그대로 모두 실었다. 칼럼의 제목(큰 제목, 부제)과 내용 또한 언론에 나간 그대로이다. 단 한 자의 가필도 수정도 없었다. 동일한 주제에 대해 현재에서 과거로 거슬러 올라가는 시간의 여정을 밟고 있다. 과거의 칼럼이 현재 칼럼의 배경이자 역사가 되어 페이지를 더할수록 스스로 설명이 되는 구조를 택했다.칼럼 뒤에는 국제분야 주요 시사용어에 대한 친절하고도 자세한 설명과 함께 현재 시점에서 필자가 칼럼에 대해 느끼는 소회와 관련 경제 지식들을 제시하였다. 특히 ‘지식 한 토막’에서는 유발 하라리와 베르베르, 폴 크루그만, 바그와티, 그레이엄 앨리슨, 마이클 스펜스 등 세계적인 작가와 학자들의 흥미진진한 분석과 이론들이 총망라되어 소개되고 있다.투키디데스 함정과 킨들버그 함정, 세계화 십계명, 포퓰리스트와 파시스트, 가용성 폭포와 인간 지각의 한계, 피케티 법…</span>

                    <span>The US labor market is particularly dynamic for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) jobs, with new technologies proliferating throughout workplaces every year. This technological change is the engine of long-run productivity growth and rising living standards. In the shorter run, however, workers in technology-intensive occupations must constantly learn on the job, or risk becoming […]

                    <span>Cyber risk poses serious threats for businesses around the world. This column develops a new text-based measure of cyber risk exposure by leveraging computational linguistics and quarterly earnings transcripts for 12,000+ firms from 85 countries over the past 20+ years. Cyber threats have tripled since 2013 and affected a lot more countries and industries. Cyber risks are priced into the stock market and are contagious. The authors conclude that cyber risk is a source of systemic risk for firms and markets.</span>

                    <span>The pandemic has caused the ECB to push its tools to their extremes. Despite considerably expanding its balance sheet and maintaining negative interest rates, inflation in the euro area remains below target. This column argues that direct transfers by the ECB to individuals, or ‘helicopter money’, should be considered as a viable contingent policy. It estimates that a transfer of 1% of GDP would increase inflation by 0.5 percentage points. A well-communicated policy with a clear exit strategy would be consistent with the ECB’s inflation targeting objective and maintain a clear boundary with fiscal policy.</span>

I&#x27;ve received a number of requests lately to post this again, so here is another update of tracking employment during Presidential terms.  We frequently use Presidential terms as time markers - we could use Speaker of the House, Fed Chair, or any other marker.
Important: There are many differences between these periods.  Overall employment was smaller in the &#x27;80s, however the participation rate was increasing in the &#x27;80s (younger population and women joining the labor force), and the participation rate is generally declining now.  But these graphs give an overview of employment changes.

                    <span>Households’ tendency to hold liquid savings at low interest rates and, at the same time, revolving debt at high interest rates is a long-standing puzzle in household finance. This pattern of behaviour has been observed across many countries, on a variety of revolving credit products including credit cards and overdrafts. Using increasingly available transaction-level data sourced from financial services providers, this column shows that co-holding is often short-lived, and may be best explained by consumers keeping separate ‘savings’ and ‘debt’ accounts earmarked for different forms of expenditures, a form of mental accounting.</span>

Rates had a good week, with most lenders at or near their best levels since mid June at the very least.  10yr Treasury yields trickled to their best levels in months by Friday afternoon after managing to break the 1.44% floor that had turned away several recent attempts.  [30YR FIXED - 3.16%]

                    <span>Faced with extreme old age and even dementia among its judges, some US states have imposed a mandatory retirement age. But this policy may remove experienced judges who are still productive in their jobs. This column examines the overall effect of mandatory retirement on court productivity in US states during 1947–1994 and finds that court productivity increased by more than 25% after the introduction of mandatory retirement. There may even be a team effectof ageing whereby the presence of older judges slows down the pace of work in the court.</span>

                    <span>From the Department of Commerce reported:
The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced today that the goods and services deficit was $71.2 billion in May, up $2.2 billion from $69.1 billion in April, revised.
May exports were $206.0 billion, $1.3 billion more than April exports. May imports were $277.3 billion, $3.5 billion more than April imports.

Exports and imports increased in May. 
Exports are up 41% compared to May 2020; imports are up 38% compared to May 2020.
Both imports and exports decreased sharply due to COVID-19, and have now bounced back (imports  more than exports),
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit, with and without petroleum.
 The blue line is the total deficit, and the black line is the petroleum deficit, and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products.
Note that net, imports and exports of petroleum products are close to zero.
The trade deficit with China decreased to $26.3 billion in May, from $26.9 billion in May 2020.</span>

                    <span>The BEA released their estimate of light vehicle sales for June this morning.  The BEA estimates sales of 15.36 million SAAR in June 2021 (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate), down 9.8% from the May sales rate, and up 18% from June 2020. 

This was well below the consensus estimate of 17.1 million SAAR.

This graph shows light vehicle sales since 2006 from the BEA (blue) and the BEA&#x27;s estimate for June (red).
The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
Since April 2020, sales have increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic). 


Sales-to-date are down 1.3% compared to the same period in 2019.

The second graph shows light vehicle sales since the BEA started keeping data in 1967.
Note: dashed line is current estimated sales rate of 15.36 million SAAR.

Leisure and hospitality gained 343 thousand jobs.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 2.2 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back almost 73% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment declined 7 thousand in June, and manufacturing added 15 thousand jobs.


NOTE: State and Local education added 230 thousand jobs, seasonally adjusted.  But this is a seasonal quirk - there were actually 413 thousand education jobs lost in June NSA, but…</span>

                    <span>From the BLS: 
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 850,000 in June, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.9 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, public and private education, professional and business services, retail trade, and other services.
...
The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised down by 9,000, from +278,000 to +269,000, and the change for May was revised up by 24,000, from +559,000 to +583,000. With these revisions, employment in April and May combined is 15,000 higher than previously reported.

The first graph shows the year-over-year change in total non-farm employment since 1968.
In June, the year-over-year change was 7.919 million jobs.  This was up significantly - since employment collapsed in April 2020.
Total payrolls increased by 850 thousand in June.  Private payrolls increased by 662 thousand.
Payrolls for April and May were revised up 15 thousand, combined.
The second graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but currently is not as severe as the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.
The third graph shows the employment population ratio and the participation rate.
The Labor Force Participation Rate was unchanged at 61.6% in June, from 61.6% in May. This is the percentage of the working age population in the labor force. 
The Employment-Population ratio was unchanged at 58.0% from 58.0% (black line).
I&#x27;ll post the 25 to 54 age group employment-population ratio graph later.
The fourth graph shows the unemployment rate.  
The unemployment rate increased in June to 5.9% from 5.8% in May. 
This was above consensus expectations, and April and May were revised up by 15,000 combined.

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of June 29th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Mild Forbearance Improvement as Quarterly Reviews Continue
As we mentioned last week, there were still more than 300,000 homeowners in forbearance whose plans were scheduled for review by the end of June. Well, of the roughly 146,000 plans reviewed for extension or removal over the past week, 44,000 homeowners left forbearance, while the plans of the other 102,000 were extended.
All in all, we wound up with a net decline of 6,000 plans. Not overly impactful, but it does set us up nicely for what could be a larger improvement next week as some 218,000 plans were still scheduled for review by Wednesday, June 30.
  
Our weekly snapshots run through Tuesday, though. As of June 29, our McDash Flash daily loan-level performance dataset showed 2.05 million homeowners – representing 3.9% of mortgaged properties – remaining in COVID-19 related forbearance plans.
  
Click on graph for larger image.
  
This puts the overall number of active plans down 145,000, a 6.6% decline from the same time last month with the rate of improvement picking up from 6% last week and 5.4% the week before.
  
A 5,000 reduction in the number of active GSE forbearance plans and a 2,000 drop in FHA/VA plans were partially offset by a rise of 1,000 among portfolio and privately held mortgages.
  
Plan starts continued to fall over the last seven days. In fact, last week saw the lowest total starts in five weeks (since the shortened business week of Memorial Day). There have been about 9% fewer starts over the last four weeks than there were in the preceding four-week period..

이벤트:  황만순 대표의 바이오 랜선특강 / 초판 한정 저자 사인본




2020년 벤처 투자 시장은 펀딩 6조 원 시대를 여는 새로운 역사를 썼다. 코로나19는 팬데믹이라는 유례없는 위기를 몰고 왔지만 동시에 많은 기업에게 기회의 장도 제공한 것이다. 많은 일반 투자자들의 관심이 특히 바이오 종목으로 집중되었지만 사실 수년째 바이오는 벤처 캐피털 업계(VC)에서 가장 핫한 투자 섹터로 자리 잡고 있었다. 

그중에서도 황만순 한투파 대표는 남다른 존재감을 발휘해왔다. 2020년만 해도 3,500억 원대의 바이오 섹터 펀드를 결성했고 지놈앤컴퍼니, 젠큐릭스, 엔젠바이오 등의 기업을 상장시키는 등 지금까지 바이오 헬스케어 분야에만 190여 개 기업에 7,500억 원 이상을 투자해왔다.

『대한민국 바이오 투자』는 바이오 섹터에 생소한 일반 개인 투자자의 질문에 대한 답변 형식으로 구성되었으며 바이오 섹터 투자에 있어 꼭 알아야 할 기초적인 관련 지식과 절대 실패하지 않는 투자 방식, 그리고 지녀야 할 마음가짐까지 친절하게 설명한다. 저자는 지난 20년 벤처 캐피털리스트로서 쌓은 경험을 나누고 싶어 이 책을 쓰게 되었으며 독자분들께 조금의 도움이라도 되길 원한다고 담담하게 이야기한다.

                    <span>The notion than an independent central bank reduces a country’s inflation has been embraced by academics, central bankers, and politicians all over the world. This is somehow puzzling, giving the ambiguity reported in empirical studies. This column argues that overall there is only a weak causal link from independence to inflation, if at all. Even a strong inflation-boosting impact from introducing central bank independence cannot be ruled out. These results are obtained from a statistical approach that has not yet been used in analyses of macroeconomic processes, although it exhibits properties well-suited to this end.</span>

                    <span>On Friday at 8:30 AM ET, the BLS will release the employment report for June.  The consensus is for 675 thousand jobs added, and for the unemployment rate to decrease to 5.6%.
• First, currently there are still about 7.6 million fewer jobs than in February 2020 (before the pandemic).
This graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but is now better than the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.
• ADP Report: The ADP employment report showed a gain of 692,000 private sector jobs, above the consensus estimate of 600,000 jobs added.  The ADP report hasn&#x27;t been very useful in predicting the BLS report, but this suggests the BLS report could be above expecta…</span>

                    <span>A few brief excerpts from a note by Goldman Sachs economist Spencer Hill:
We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 750k in June (mom sa) ... Coupled with very strong labor demand and continued progress on vaccinations and reopening, we believe job growth probably picked up further in the month. ... We estimate a two-tenths drop in the unemployment rate to 5.6%, reflecting a strong household employment gain but a further rise in the participation rate.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 7.3% compared to the same week in 2019.  Leisure (weekend) occupancy has recovered, but weekday (more business) is still down double digits.

From CoStar: STR: Weekly US Hotel Occupancy Inches Closer to 70%
U.S. weekly hotel occupancy hit its highest level since late October 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through June 26.
June 20-26, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 69.9% (-7.3%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$133.36 (-0.5%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$93.19 (-7.8%)
 In addition to occupancy reaching its highest point since the week ending 26 October 2019, ADR and RevPAR were the highest of the pandemic-era. Weekend occupancy surpassed the 2019 comparable for the second time in three weeks, while ADR was 13% higher than the corresponding weekend from June 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the next two months should have decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.</span>

                    <span>From the Census Bureau reported that overall construction spending decreased:
Construction spending during May 2021 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,545.3 billion, 0.3 percent below the revised April estimate of $1,549.5 billion. The May figure is 7.5 percent above the May 2020 estimate of $1,437.7 billion.

Private spending increased and public spending decreased:
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,203.3 billion, 0.3 percent below the revised April estimate of $1,206.8 billion. ...
In May, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $342.0 billion, 0.2 percent below the revised April estimate of $342.7 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 11% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 9% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been weak recently.
Public construction spending is 5% above the previous peak in March 2009, and 30% above the austerity low in February 2014, but weak recently.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 28.7%.  Non-residential spending is down 5.8% year-over-year.  Public spending is down 8.7% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service in most areas and did not decline sharply like many other sectors, but some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 23.2% YoY, multi-retail down 18.0% YoY, and office down 8.3% YoY.

This was below consensus expectations of a 0.4% increase in spending, however construction spending for the previous months was revised up.</span>

지금은 버블인가, 아닌가? 현재 상황을 두고 개인 투자자들은 물론 전문가들도 의견이 팽팽하게 맞선다. 급변하는 현재를 어떻게 해석하고 행동을 취해야 하는가? 거대한 전환점에 서 있는 우리는 이익을 얻는 사람이 될 것인가, 잃는 사람이 될 것인가? 이 책은 인류 최초의 버블부터 현재까지 300년 역사를 뒤흔든 버블의 사태를 살펴본다. 왜, 무엇이, 버블을 만들었으며 누가 그것을 이용해 부를 잃고 누군가는 이익을 얻었는지 반복되는 호황과 불황의 주기를 바탕으로 통찰력을 제공한다.

저자들은 ‘시장성·자본·투기’가 만드는 거품 경제를 ‘버블 트라이앵글’이라고 분석하며 새로운 프레임워크를 제시한다. 역사상 버블의 사태는 이 3가지 요건의 비이성적 패턴을 가졌다는 것이다. 사회적 변화와 이슈가 있을 때마다 전 세계 경제는 대전환기를 맞아왔다. 코로나 19가 지핀 전 세계 경제 변화는 씨앗의 형태가 다를 뿐, 역사상 최초의 현상이 아니다. &#x27;파이낸셜타임스&#x27;가 선정한 올해의 책이자, 급변하는 경제 상황을 분석하고 새로운 프레임워크를 제시하는 을 통해 거인의 어깨, 놀라운 통찰에서 그 답을 구해보자.

차세대 산업혁명인 4차 산업혁명은 지금껏 상상만 해 왔던 기술들을 점차 현실화시키고 있다. 많은 이들이 우려하는 대로 이러한 기술의 진보가 인간의 일자리를 빼앗는 일이 이미 벌어지고 있다. 얼마 전까지만 해도 사람이 제공하던 서비스들을 이제 AI(인공지능)나 로봇 등의 기계가 대신 하는 일이 급속히 늘고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 본격적으로 진행될수록 이런 현상은 더욱 가속화할 것이다.

저자는 일과 일자리 관점에서 볼 때 4차 산업혁명은 인간의 사고를 뿌리까지 바꾸게 함으로써 이전과는 완전히 다른 세상을 도래하게 만드는 ‘변곡점’이 될 것이라 확신하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명을 통해 발전할 기술들로 인해 기존의 일자리 대다수가 사라질 가능성이 농후하기 때문이다. 

많은 이들이 4차 산업혁명의 기술적 성취에 취해 장밋빛 미래를 그리고 있는 지금, 저자는 다음과 같은 질문을 던진다. 4차 산업혁명이 성공적으로 마무리되고 나면 우리는 기술 진보의 혜택을 마음껏 향유할 수 있을까? 현재와 같은 우리 일자리는 남아 있을까? 그때에도 우리는 먹고살기 위해 일해야 할까? 모든 면에서 인류를 능가하는 AI가 등장해도 우리는 지금처럼 생태계 최정상의 지위를 유지할 수 있을까?

이 책은 인류 문명 탄생부터 AI와 로봇까지, 일과 일자리 변천사를 일목요연하게 정리하고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 앞선 산업혁명들과 본질적으로 어떤 차이가 있으며 어느 정도의 파급력을 가질지에 대해 통찰력 있는 전망을 내놓고 있다. 그리고 기술 진보가 예고된 미래 세상을 디스토피아가 아닌 유토피아로 만들기 위해 지금 인류가 어떤 준비를 해야 하는지에 대해서도 구체적인 방안을 제시한다.

[라이노 파이썬]은 라이노 환경과 사용법에 어느 정도 익숙한 독자를 대상으로 하고 있으며, 파이썬 언어를 활용한 라이노 프로그램의 조형 연구 및 제어를 다루고 있다. 이 책의 근본적인 목적은 특정 언어 및 프로그램의 사용법을 익히게 하는 것이 아니라, 건축 디지털 디자인과 관련된 프로그래밍에 대한 기본적인 이해를 돕고 3D 프로그램과의 연동 및 그 가능성을 탐구하도록 하는 것이다. 

건축 디자이너로서 프로그래밍을 어떻게 받아들여야 하는지, 프로그래밍은 무엇을 할 수 있는지, 스크립트를 쓸 때는 어떻게 생각해 나가야 하는지, 기본적인 바탕으로 숙지해야 되는 내용은 무엇인지 등 디지털 디자인에 대한 생각을 정리하고, 직접 뛰어들어 써 나갈 수 있도록 방향을 제시할 수 있는 조력자의 역할을 수행하고자 한다.

본 연구는 북한당국이 발표하는 지역별 토지가격이나 토지의 특성에 관한 자료들이 없는 조건에서 북한지역의 토지가격과 토지자산의 규모를 추정하는 방법론과 모형을 제시하고 이를 이용하여 북한 시가화지역 전체를 대상으로 시장가격 기준의 토지자산 규모를 실험적으로 추정하였다.   우선 관련 사회경제적 변수를 이용가능하면서 최근의 북한과 소득수준의 격차가 상대적으로 크지 않았던 것으로 평가되는 남한의 1970년대 중후반, 그리고 도시화 수준이 유사했던 1980년대 초반 남한의 시, 군, 구별 실거래가격을 기준으로 시가화지역 토지에 대한 지가결정함수를 도출하였다. 다음으로 북한지역에 대한 지리정보분석을 통해 도출되는 지가결정요인의 대리변수들을 대입하여 2015년경 북한 시가화지역 토지의 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율을 산출하였다. 더 나아가서 최근 북한지역 일부 도시들을 대상으로 조사된 주택거래가격과 본고에서 추정한 상대가격비율을 결합하여 북한전역을 대상으로 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모를 추정하였다.  추정결과 북한 시가화지역의 토지가격은 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율로 볼 때 평양시 동대원구역이 100으로 제일 높고 양강도 풍서군이 1.70으로 가장 낮은 것으로 평가되었다. 한편 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모는 2015년 기준 216억 달러로 추정되었는데, 이는 동년 북한GDP의 1.2~1.3배에 달하는 규모이다.  이 비율은 남한의 1978~1980년과 비슷한데, 해당시기의 남한의 경제성장률이 평균 6%인데 반해 북한은 1%대 수준인 것을 고려하면 상당히 높은 것으로 보인다.</span>

본 연구에서는 2017년과 2019년 이민자 체류실태 및 고용조사 자료를 이용하여 직업훈련 프로그램이 외국인의 노동시장 성과에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 성향점수매칭(propensity score matching)을 적용한 분석 결과를 살펴보면, 직업훈련은 평균적으로 외국인들의 고용률을 6.4%p 높였으며 월평균임금을 상승시키는 효과도 있었다. 또한, 체류자격에 따라 상이한 효과가 나타났는데 먼저 취업비자로 들어온 외국인은 훈련참여의 결과로 고용률이 크게 높아지지 않았지만 임금 상승효과는 상당히 컸다. 반면, 결혼이민자의 경우 임금에 대한 긍정적 효과가 관찰되지 않았다. 정주비자 소지자는 훈련을 통해 고용률과 임금이 모두 증가하였다.</span>

본 연구는 1981년부터 2019년까지 한국의 생산가능인구 1인당 실질 GDP 추세성장률을 추정하기 위해 추세성장률이 임의보행을 따르는 비관측요인모형을 사용한다. 추정 결과, 추세성장률은 외환위기를 극복하던 시기인 2000년 전후를 제외하고 1980년대 후반부터 2010년대 초반까지 지속해서 하락하였다. 추세성장회계를 통해 추세성장률 하락요인을 분석한 결과, 지속적인 추세성장률 하락은 노동생산성 둔화와 관련이 깊은 것으로 나타났다. 구체적으로 살펴보면, 1988년부터 1998년까지의 추세성장률 1차 하락기는 외환위기 이전부터 둔화되기 시작한 노동증강 총요소생산성에 가장 큰 영향을 받았다. 이러한 결과는 외환위기로 추세성장률이 하락했다는 가설과는 배치되는 것이다. 한편 부진한 투자는 2002년부터 2012년까지의 2차 하락기의 중요한 배경인 것으로 나타났다.</span>

오랫동안 학자들은 인간 행동도 바이러스처럼 우연한 접촉을 통해 전파된다고 믿었다. 그러나 새로운 믿음이나 행동, 규범의 확산은 질병의 확산과는 다른 규칙을 따른다. 무엇보다 이러한 변화들은 개인의 삶을 뒤바꿀 뿐 아니라 기업과 정부, 세계 질서에 거대한 전환을 불러온다. 아무도 경험하지 못한 대변혁의 길목에서 이제는 ‘변화는 어떻게 일어나는가’라는 근본적인 질문을 던져야 하는 이유다.

이 책은 우리 주변에서 발생하는 크고 작은 변화의 메커니즘을 과학적으로 밝힌다. 변화는 어떻게 일어나고, 찻잔 속 태풍으로 끝나는 일이 왜 그토록 많은가? 가망 없어 보이던 혁신이 안착하고, 논란을 동반한 홍보 캠페인이 승리를 거두고, 비주류로 불리던 운동이 세상을 뒤흔든 데에는 어떤 비밀이 숨어 있는가?

20년 넘게 방대한 연구를 이어온 저자는 그 핵심이 소셜 네트워크, 즉 사회적 연결망에 있음을 증명해낸다. 복잡한 전염(complex contagion)이라는 개념에 따르면, 기존의 믿음과 규범을 흔드는 변화일수록 가족이나 친구, 동료처럼 끈끈하게 연결된 관계가 확산의 성패를 좌우한다. 소수의 유명 인플루언서와 오피니언 리더가 다수를 움직인다는 통념이 뒤집히는 순간이다.

전 세계를 강타한 코로나19 바이러스의 대유행으로 수억 명의 감염자와 수백만 명의 사망자가 발생하면서 지구촌 전체가 큰 위기를 맞고 있다. 4차 산업혁명과 인공지능을 기반으로 한 과학기술의 발전으로 인류는 보다 편리하고 풍요로운 미래를 맞이하게 되었지만 디지털 전환과 맞물려서 가속화된 비대면 방식의 삶과 급격한 일자리 변화는 그동안 우리 사회를 움직여왔던 메커니즘에 상당한 충격을 안겨 주었다.    

《팬데믹과 한국 사회의 대전환》은 국내를 대표하는 5인의 석학들이 코로나 이후 한국 사회를 진단하고 뉴노멀을 향한 시대의 갈림길에서 인간, 사회 그리고 세상에 대한 근원적인 질문을 던진다. 고(故) 박태준 포스코 명예회장 10주기 추모 학술 연구로 2020년 12월 진행된 ‘포스텍 미래 전략 좌담회’ 내용을 정리한 이 책에서는 팬데믹 상황에서 위기에 처한 우리의 안전과 자유’를 다시 생각해 보고 시장경제의 변화가 민주주의에 어떠한 영향을 미치는지 살펴본다. 

또한 인류가 처했던 역사적 위기 상황을 현재와 비교하고 해결책을 제시하며, 팬데믹으로 가속화된 불평등과 양극화 현상의 이유와 탈진실의 시대에 우리가 어떻게 생각하고 행동해야 이러한 위기를 극복할 수 있는지 살펴본다.

인사말

개발자로 일하던 저자가 교사가 되어 학생들에게 프로그래밍을 가르친 경험을 바탕으로 집필한 책이다. 프로그래밍을 힘들어하는 학생들이 좀 더 쉽고 재미있게 프로그래밍을 받아들일 수 있는 방법을 고민한 결과가 오롯이 담겨 있다. 친숙한 실생활 사례를 예제로 구현하고, 이해하기 쉽게 비유를 들어 설명한다. 
또한, 머릿속으로 구상한 아이디어가 코드로 옮겨지는 과정을 최대한 자세히 실어 입문자가 초반에 겪는 코드 구현의 어려움을 극복할 수 있게 돕는다. 자세히 설명하고 직관적으로 이해할 수 있게 내용은 풍부하게 넣고, 가볍게 들고 다니도록 2권으로 분권 구성했다.

우리는 매일 괴로운 문제들의 쳇바퀴를 걷는다. 매일 아침 집을 나설 때마다 차 열쇠나 지갑이 어디 있는지 몰라 허둥대고, 회사에 출근해서는 끝없이 반복되는 잡무에 시달린다. 산업 현장에서는 늘 노동자가 죽거나 다치고, 어린이와 여성이 폭력에 희생됐다는 뉴스도 끊이질 않는다. 노력과 성과가 차곡차곡 쌓여 나아지는 세상을 꿈꾸지만, 현실은 늘 비슷한 문제들이 터지고 또 터지는 지옥도에 가깝다. 왜 그런 걸까? 해결 방법은 있는 걸까?

이 책 제목 『업스트림』은 ‘상류’라는 뜻으로, 문제에 선제적으로 대응하는 사고방식과 시스템을 말한다. 이 책은 우리가 문제의 근본 원인을 예측하거나 대비하는 일이 충분히 가능함에도 불구하고, 문제가 터지면 ‘대응’하는 데에만 급급하면서 수많은 기회를 놓치고 있다고 말한다. 바로 이 차이, 즉 문제를 상류에서 원천적으로 해결하느냐 하류에서 막기만 하느냐에 따라서 조직이, 인생이 달라진다는 점을 보여준다.  

질문 하나로 1억 달러를 아낀 여행 회사에서부터 인당 13달러에 불과한 돈으로 6만 명을 구한 허리케인 시뮬레이션 팀까지, 우리의 상식을 뛰어넘는 놀라운 결과 뒤에는 항상 ‘업스트림’이 있다. 문제의 상류로 가라! 이 책은 현재의 작은 문제에 머무르려는 본능을 이기고 나아가려는 당신에게 새로운 길을 열어주는 도끼가 될 것이다.

한국의 독자들에게

2장. ‘과연 내가 나서도 될까?’라는 의문: 주인의식 부족
내가 아니라면 그 누구도 해결할 수 없어 | 사람들이 문제와 연관된 것처럼 느끼게 만들라 | 소아과 의사들은 어째서 카시트 의무화를 주장했을까 | 주인의식이 가져온 놀라운 결과 | 문제의 피해자에서 벗어나 문제의 소유자로

3장. 조금만 더 이따가, 급한 일부터 처리한 다음에: 터널링 증후군
업스트림 활동은 왜 그리 드물까? | 우리의 눈과 귀를 막는 터널링 증후군 | 똑똑한 사람들이 모여 멍청한 조직을 만드는 이유 | 터널 탈출을 위해선 게으름이 필요하다 | 뇌, 본능, 그리고 위험 회피 | 냄비 속 개구리가 될 뻔한 인류 | 업스트림 활동을 위해 우리 본능을 역이용하는 법



4장. 꼭 필요한 사람을 모집해 문제의 심각성을 각인시켜라: 인재
거리를 장악한 10대들 | 마약과 알코올을 퇴치하기 위한 새로운 비전 | 위험 요소는 줄이고 보호 요인은 늘리고 | 업스트림 개입을 위해서는 문제를 포위하라 | 시스템의 틈새로 추락한 여자들 | 범죄현장 사진 속 깁스가 보여준 비밀 | 가정폭력 해결을 위한 드림팀을 꾸리다 | 조직의 성공과 데이터의 성공 | 록퍼드는 어떻게 1년 만에 노숙자 문제를 해결했을까? | 마인드셋의 변화가 가져온 위대한 승리

60만 명. 쉬이 가늠되지 않는 숫자다. 15만 8,000명. 구체적으로 그려지지 않는 건 마찬가지다. 앞의 숫자는 1999년부터 2017년 사이에 사망한 사람의 수고, 뒤의 숫자는 그중 2017년 한 해에 해당하는 사망자 수다. 

15만 8,000명의 사망자는 매일 세 대의 보잉 737 여객기가 추락해 승객 전원이 죽는 사고가 발생하는 것과 같다. 그런데, 이 사망자 숫자가 의미하는 것은 무엇일까? 미국 중년 백인층의 사망률에 돌연 반전이 일어나지 않았다면, 즉 20세기 들어 멈춤 없이 낮아지던 사망률의 흐름이 계속 유지되었다면 죽지 않았을 사람의 수다. 

노벨경제학상을 받은 경제학자 앵거스 디턴과 보건경제학의 귄위자 앤 케이스는 이처럼 일어나지 말았어야 하는 죽음에 ‘절망사’라는 이름을 붙인다. 이는 저소득·저학력 백인층에서 나타나는 현상으로 자살, 약물 중독, 알코올 중독으로 인한 죽음이다. 경제학의 두 거장은 오늘날 미국을 강타한 절망사라는 비극, 어쩌면 머지않아 다른 나라와 다른 세대의 문제가 될지 모르는 전염병에 대해 이야기한다.

나아가 두 저자는 절망사라는 단서에서 출발해 미국의 경제 시스템과 사회 전반을 해부하고 문제의 근본 원인을 파고들어, 우리…</span>

우리 사회를 휩싸고 있는 사회불평등, 실업과 고용불안정, 생태계 파괴와 기후위기 등은 시장만능주의와 맹목적인 경제성장의 결과이다. 이러한 자본주의의 고삐 풀린 질주와 획일성에 맞서는 것으로서 제3섹터 실천들이 새롭게 조명 받고 있다. 이 실천들에 대한 명칭은 사회적경제, 연대경제, 사회적기업, 비영리부문, 결사체부문 등 국가와 지역에 따라 다양하다. 하지만 이 실천들을 ‘사회연대경제’로 포괄할 수 있는데, 이 책은 이를 통해 시장논리와 비시장논리, 나아가 비화폐논리를 조율하는 제3섹터가 지닌 다원적 경제의 관점과 실천을 명확히 이해하는 길을 열어준다.

&#x27;사회연대경제&#x27;는 사회연대경제에 대한 학술연구 발전에서 주요한 역할을 담당했던 불어권 유수의 연구자들이 참여한 공동작업의 결과물로, 각 장은 해당 실천 범주에 대한 종합정리라 할 수 있다. 우리 사회의 학술적 토론뿐만 아니라 현장의 실천을 위해 필요한 개념적이고 분석적인 토대를 강화하는 데 큰 도움이 될 것이다.

인간다운 삶을 위한 최소 소득을 보장하기 위해 국가나 지방자치단체가 모든 개인에게 조건 없이 정기적으로 현금을 지급하는 기본소득. 양극화 해소와 4차 산업혁명에 따른 사회경제적 변화에 대처할 수 있는 획기적인 정책으로 기대된다. 그러나 이 같은 취지의 제도도 재원 마련이라는 난관을 해결하는 것이 관건이다. 

기본소득 재원으로 ‘국토보유세’를 제시한 이 책은 개인과 법인이 가진 모든 토지에 세금을 매겨 전 국민에게 똑같이 나누면 불평등의 주요 원인인 토지 불로소득도 잡고 기본소득의 재원도 마련할 수 있어 ‘일석이조’라고 설명한다. 또한 과세대상자의 95%는 내는 세금보다 기본소득으로 받는 금액이 더 많은 순수혜가구인 ‘기본소득형 국토보유세’는 조세 저항의 부담도 적다는 것.  

『답이 있는 기본소득』은 이 같은 기본소득형 국토보유세 설계를 위해 부동산 실태 및 보유세제 개편 방향과 경제적 영향력을 치밀하게 분석했으며 입법안까지 제시하는 등 국토보유세를 둘러싼 모든 쟁점들에 대해 상세히 답을 밝히고 있다. 

기본소득형 국토보유세를 통해 ‘부동산 공화국’, ‘불로소득 공화국’이라는 오명을 벗고 21세기형 경제정의를 구현할 기본소득을 현실화시킬 수 있을지 길을 보여주는 책이다.

파이썬은 초보자부터 전문가까지 사용자층을 보유하고 있는데 그 이유는 누구나 쉽게 접근하여 대부분의 응용 소프트웨어에서 사용 가능하기 때문이다. 동적 타이핑(Dynamic typing) 범용 프로그래밍 언어로, 펄 및 루비가 있는데 파이썬과 자주 비교되지만 다양한 플랫폼에서 쓸 수 있고, 라이브러리(모듈)가 풍부하여, 대학 및 다양한 교육기관, 연구 기관 및 산업계에서 이용이 증가하고 있다. 

이 책은 파이썬에 대한 전문지식과 IT 서비스 및 인프라 구축에 필요한 모든 정보를 담았다. 순개념 익히기부터 문제 학습, 능력 넓히기, 실전문제 도전, 마스터 능력 갖추기까지 핵심을 찌르는 개념 익히기와 실전문제로 파이썬을 빠르게 학습한다. 또한 단계별 구성으로 더 체계적인 스스로 학습이 가능하다.

데이터 분석을 다룬 많은 책 중 나에게 맞는 책을 찾는 건 매우 어렵다. 이론 위주의 책을 선택하면 이해하기 어렵고, 응용 위주의 책을 선택하면 기본 개념이 부족하다. 이 책은 이론을 쉽게 설명하고 예제로 응용해 보도록 구성하여 자연스럽게 데이터 분석 과정을 익힐 수 있다.

파이썬 데이터 분석에 필수로 사용되는 라이브러리를 단계적으로 다루어 데이터를 전처리하고 분석하는 능력을 갖춘다. 이 과정에서 넘파이, 판다스, 맷플롯립은 물론 연관 라이브러리까지 상세히 소개한다. 그리고 소개한 라이브러리를 종합하여 활용할 수 있는 세 가지 실전 예제를 담았다.

지난해 하반기 이후 우리나라의 금융시스템은 대체로 안정된 모습을 유지하였다. 코로나19 재확산 움직임에도 불구하고 경기회복 기대가 커지면서 금융시장은 비교적 안정세를 보였고, 금융중개기능도 원활히 작동하였다. 전반적인 금융시스템 상황을 보여주는 금융안정지수(FSI)는 작년 4월 위기단계 진입 이후 하락세를 지속하여 금년 5월에는 주의단계 임계치(8)를 하회하는 1.8(잠정)까지 낮아졌다.
    


    
금융안정 상황을 부문별로 살펴보면, 신용시장의 경우 가계와 기업 모두 차입을 늘리면서 민간신용의 높은 증가세가 이어지는 가운데 명목GDP 성장률이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 명목GDP 대비 민간신용 비율이 큰 폭 상승하였다. 가계신용은 주택 매매·전세 관련 대출 증가 등의 영향으로 증가세가 확대된 반면 가계의 처분가능소득 증가율이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 가계의 채무상환부담이 늘어났다.
    


    
기업신용도 코로나19 장기화 등에 따른 자금수요 지속 등으로 증가세를 이어갔다. 기업의 전반적인 재무상황이 개선되고 있으나 기업간 채무상환능력의 차이는 심화되었다. 한편 가계 및 기업 대출 연체율이 낮은 수준을 유지하고 있으나 향후 경기회복이 부문간·업종간 차별화되는 양상을 보일 경우 가계와 기업의 취약부문을 중심으로 부실 위험이 커질 수 있다.
