                    <span>This study examines the uneven effects of air pollution from maritime ports on physical and mental health across racial groups. We exploit quasi-random variation in vessels in port from weather events far out in the ocean to estimate how port traffic influences air pollution and human health. We find that one additional vessel in a port over a year leads to 3.0 hospital visits per thousand Black residents within 25 miles of the port and only 1.0 per thousand for whites. We assess a port-related environmental regulation and show that the policy can help alleviate racial inequalities in health outcomes.</span>

                    <span>This paper examines how a firm&#x27;s choice of the type of experiment impacts on its potential exploitation of new technological opportunities. It does so in the context of the failure of successful firms (or disruption) where the literature has informally suggested that firms undertake errors in experimental choice (in particular, choosing experiments that involved biased signals). It is shown that firms will generically choose biased over unbiased experiments even when there are no differences in their relative costs. This is done to better inform decisions regarding the exploitation of technological opportunities. It is shown that these choices can differ between incumbents and entrants based on their fundamentals as well as because of the anticipation of competition between them.</span>

                    <span>We develop a theory of bank board risk committees. With this theory, such committees are valuable even though there is no expectation that bank risk is lower if the bank has a well-functioning risk committee. As predicted by our theory (1) many large and complex banks voluntarily chose to have a risk committee before the Dodd-Frank Act forced bank holding companies with assets in excess of $10 billion to have a board risk committee, and (2) establishing a board risk committee does not reduce a bank’s risk on average. Using unique interview data, we show that the work of risk committees is consistent with our theory in part.</span>

                    <span>Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by renewable electricity are a centerpiece of efforts to decarbonize transportation. EV advocates also claim benefits from local pollution reductions, lower life-cycle costs to consumers, and improved energy security. We examine the theory and evidence behind these claims and evaluate when the market will produce the optimal path of EV adoption. Optimal EV policy is nuanced. While EVs driven in some locations reduce pollution, they increase pollution in others. While many consumers enjoy cost savings from EVs, some experience net benefits from choosing gasoline-powered cars, even after accounting for EV subsidies. And depending on the dynamic benefits of stimulating EV adoption today, optimal policy might front-load stimulus, even though the environmental benefits of EV adoption are likely to increase over time as electricity grids become cleaner. Reflecting these nuances, the policy landscape is complicated and often creates conflicting incentives for EV adoption in regions with ambitious adoption goals. We highlight several themes for policy design, including 1) promoting regional variation in EV policies that align private incentives with social benefits, 2) pursuing a time-path of policies that follows the trajectory of marginal benefits, and 3) rationalizing electricity and gasoline prices to reflect their social marginal cost. On the extensive margin, purchase incentives should ramp-down as learning-by-doing and network externalities that may exist diminish; on the intensive margin, gasoline should become relative more expensive than electricity (per mile traveled) to reflect cleaner marginal emissions from electricity generation.</span>

                    <span>This study constructs a large new dataset to investigate whether state policy led to ethnic Ukrainians experiencing higher mortality during the 1932–33 Soviet Great Famine. All else equal, famine (excess) mortality rates were positively associated with ethnic Ukrainian population share across provinces, as well as across districts within provinces. Ukrainian ethnicity, rather than the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian republic, mattered for famine mortality. These and many additional results provide strong evidence that higher Ukrainian famine mortality was an outcome of policy, and suggestive evidence on the political-economic drivers of repression. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that bias against Ukrainians explains up to 77% of famine deaths in the three republics of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and up to 92% in Ukraine.</span>

                    <span>Local policies can have substantial spillovers both across geographies and markets. Little is known about the impact of public health regulations across administrative borders. We estimate U.S. county level direct and spillover effects of Stay-at-Home-Orders (SHOs) aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 on mobility and social interaction measures. We propose a modified difference-in-difference regression design, based on contiguous-county triplets. This approach compares treated counties, which adopted the SHO, and neighbors, to the neighbor&#x27;s neighbors, which we term hinterland, counties. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declined by a third to a half as much as in the treated locations. These spillover effects are concentrated in neighbors that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we decompose the spillover decline in mobility into reductions in external visits coming from the treated county and an even stronger voluntary decline in the neighbor county&#x27;s own traffic. Together, our results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and illustrate the quantitative importance of voluntary social distancing. The finding that the estimated spillovers are in the same direction as the direct effects casts doubt on the prevailing narrative that a more nationally coordinated policy response would have accomplished a greater reduction in mobility and contacts.</span>

                    <span>This paper uses detailed data on sequential offers from seven vastly different real-world bargaining settings to document a robust pattern: agents favor offers that split the difference between the two most recent offers on the table. Our settings include negotiations for used cars, insurance injury claims, a TV game show, auto rickshaw rides, housing, international trade tariffs, and online retail. We demonstrate that this pattern can arise in a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of an alternating-offer game with two-sided incomplete information, but this equilibrium is far from unique. We then provide a robust-inference argument to explain why agents may view the two most recent offers as corresponding to the potential surplus. Split-the-difference offers under this weaker, robust inference can then be viewed as fair. We present a number of other patterns in each data setting that point to split-the-difference offers as a strong social norm, whether in high-stakes or low-stakes negotiations.</span>

                    <span>Puerto Rico operated as a tax haven under U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 936. Firms in the pharmaceutical industry accounted for approximately 50% of tax credits awarded and 20% of employment under the program. The U.S. Congress eliminated the tax exemption program in 2006, creating a natural experiment on the elimination of corporate taxation of intangible assets. We use panel data on establishments from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and a difference in difference methodology to measure the impact of the elimination of IRC Section 936 on pharmaceutical and medical devices using establishments with low, medium and high participation in the program as controls.  Survival rates of all manufacturing establishments declined after the phaseout and elimination of the tax exemption program but pharmaceutical and medical devices establishments experienced an additional 6.9% decline. Approximately 50% of the 34% decline in pharmaceutical and medical devices establishments in Puerto Rico from 1995 to 2017 can be attributed to the elimination of IRC Section 936. Employment in pharmaceutical and medical devices establishments, which also declined by 34%,  decreased at the same rate as that of other industries. Plant closings accounted for most of the decline in their employment.</span>

                    <span>This paper examines the political economy of U.S. trade policy around the time of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, a period when policy was unconstrained by trade agreements. We consider a model of politically-optimal trade policy for a large country that can influence its terms of trade and where workers and firms lobby for protection. The predictions of the model hinge on import demand and export supply elasticities, which we estimate using detailed U.S. import data from 1927-35, as well as industry lobbying data. We find that tariff levels are largely determined by firm lobbies, but about about 5 percentage points of the tariffs are explained by terms of trade considerations. Decomposing the politically-optimal tariff in 1931 reveals an intensification of demand for protection by workers in the Smoot-Hawley tariff.</span>

The goal of this paper is to provide new evidence on the impact of online versus face-to-face instruction on student learning outcomes, using rich, transcript-level longitudinal data from a public university. We pay particular attention to eliminating selection bias by incorporating student and instructor fixed effects into the empirical analysis as well as to separate out the impact of online versus in-person education from COVID-19-related confounding factors. Our results indicate that students in face-to-face courses perform better than their online counterparts with respect to their grades, the propensity to withdraw from the course, and the likelihood of …</span>

                    <span>In recent years, measured TFP growth in the US has declined. We argue that two forces contributed to this decline: the mismeasurement of intangible capital, and rising markups. Markups affect input shares, while intangibles omitted from measures of investment affect measured capital growth, each potentially generating downward bias in measured TFP growth. Most importantly, when both forces are simultaneously present, their effects reinforce each other and amplify the downward bias in measured TFP growth. Using input-output data, we estimate that this mechanism could account for one-third to two-thirds of the decline in measured TFP growth.</span>

                    <span>The rigorous evaluation of anti-poverty programs is key to the fight against global poverty. Traditional approaches rely heavily on repeated in-person field surveys to measure program effects. However, this is costly, time-consuming, and often logistically challenging. Here we provide the first evidence that we can conduct such program evaluations based solely on high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning methods. Our application estimates changes in household welfare in a recent anti-poverty program in rural Kenya. Leveraging a large literature documenting a reliable relationship between housing quality and household wealth, we infer changes in household wealth based on satellite-derived changes in housing quality and obtain consistent results with the traditional field-survey based approach. Our approach generates inexpensive and timely insights on program effectiveness in international development programs.</span>

                    <span>Supply chains for many agricultural products have an hour-glass shape; in between a sizable number of farmers and consumers is a smaller number of processors.  The concentrated nature of the meat processing sectors in the United States implies that disruption of the processing capacity of any one plant, from accident, weather, or as recently witnessed – worker illnesses from a pandemic – has the potential to lead to system-wide disruptions.  We explore the extent to which a less concentrated meat processing sector would be less vulnerable to the risks of temporary plant shutdowns.  We calibrate an economic model to match the actual horizontal structure of the U.S. beef packing sector and conduct counter-factual simulations.  With Cournot competition among heterogeneous packing plants, the model determines how industry output and producer and consumer welfare vary with the odds of exogenous plant shutdowns under different horizontal structures.  We find that increasing odds of shutdown results in a widening of the farm-to-retail price spread even as packer profits fall, regardless of the structure.  Results indicate that the extent to which a more diffuse packing sector performs better in ensuring a given level of output, and thus food security, depends on the exogenous risk of shutdown and the level of output desired; no horizontal structure dominates.  These results illustrate the consequences of policies and industry efforts aimed at increasing the resilience of the food supply chain and highlight that there are no easy solutions to improving the short-run resilience by changing the horizontal concentration of meat packing.</span>

                    <span>Hospitals anchor much of US health care and receive a third of all medical spending, including various subsidies. Nevertheless, some become insolvent and exit the market. Research has documented subsequent access problems; however, less is understood about broader implications. We examine over 100 rural hospital closures spanning 2005-2017 to quantify the effects on the local economy. We find sharp and persistent reductions in employment, but these localize to health care occupations and are largely driven by areas experiencing complete closures. Aggregate consumer financial health is only modestly affected, and housing markets were already depressed prior to hospital closures.</span>

We characterize analytically the transition path of the spatial distribution of economic activity in response to shocks. We apply our framework to the reallocation of US economic activity from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt from 1965-2015. We find slow convergence to steady-state, with US states closer to steady-state at the end of our sample period than at its beginning. We find substantial heterogeneity in the effects of local shocks, which depend on capital and labor dynamics, and the spatial and sectoral incidence of these shocks.</span>

                    <span>Exporting abroad is much harder than selling at home, and overcoming hurdles to exporting takes time. Our goal is to identify specific barriers to exporting and to measure their importance.  We develop a model of firm-level export dynamics that features costly customer search, network effects in finding buyers, and learning about product appeal. Fitting the model to customs records of U.S. imports of manufactures from Colombia we replicate patterns of exporter maturation. A potentially valuable intangible asset of a firm is its customer base and knowledge of a market. Our model delivers some striking estimates of what such assets are worth.  Averaging across active exporters, the loss from total market amnesia (losing its current U.S. customer base along with its accumulated knowledge of product appeal) is US$ 3.4 million, about 34 percent of the value of exporting overall. About half is the loss of future sales to existing customers while the rest is the cost of relearning its appeal in the market and reestablishing visibility as an exporter. As finding buyers takes time, the 5-year response of total export sales to an exchange rate shock exceeds the 1-year response by about 40 percent, with the 1-year response reflecting mostly sales per exporter-importer match and the 5-year response, reflecting the number of matches almost as much as sales per match.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies how structural change in labor supply along the development spectrum shapes cross-country differences in hours worked. We emphasize two main forces: sectoral reallocation from self-employment to wage work, and declining fixed costs of wage work. We show that these forces are crucial for understanding how the extensive margin (the employment rate) and intensive margin (hours per worker) of aggregate hours worked vary with income per capita. To do so we build and estimate a quantitative model of labor supply featuring a traditional self-employment sector and a modern wage-employment sector. When estimated to match cross-country data, the model predicts that sectoral reallocation explains more than half of the total hours decrease at lower levels of development. Declining fixed costs drive the rise in employment rates at higher levels of income per capita, and imply higher hours in the future, in contrast to the lower hours resulting from income effects and expansions in tax-and-transfer systems.</span>

                    <span>We study how inertia interacts with market power and adverse selection in managed competition health insurance markets. We use consumer-level data to estimate a model of the California ACA exchange, in which four firms dominate the market and risk adjustment is in place to manage selection.  We estimate high inertia costs, equal to 44% of average premiums. Although eliminating inertia exacerbates adverse selection, it significantly reduces market power such that average premiums decrease 13.2% and annual per-capita welfare increases $902.  These effects are substantially smaller in settings without market power and/or risk adjustment. Moreover, converting the ACA&#x27;s premium-linked subsidies to vouchers mitigates the impact of inertia by reducing market power, whereas reducing high consumer churn in the ACA exchanges increases the impact of inertia by enhancing market power.  The impact of inertia is not sensitive to provider network generosity, despite greater consumer attachment to plans with more differentiated provider networks.</span>

                    <span>New technologies have enabled firms to elicit granular behavioral data from consumers in exchange for lower prices and better experiences. This data can mitigate asymmetric information and moral hazard, but it may also increase firms’ market power if kept proprietary. We study a voluntary monitoring program by a major U.S. auto insurer, in which drivers accept short-term tracking in exchange for potential discounts on future premiums. Using a proprietary dataset matched with competitor price menus, we document that safer drivers self-select into monitoring, and those who opt in become yet 30% safer while monitored. Using an equilibrium model of consumer choice and firm pricing for insurance and monitoring, we find that the monitoring program generates large profit and welfare gains. However, large demand frictions hurt monitoring adoption, forcing the firm to offer large discounts to induce opt-in while preventing the unmonitored pool from unraveling given the competitive environment. A counterfactual policy requiring the firm to make monitoring data public would thus further reduce the firm’s incentive to elicit monitoring data, leading to less monitoring and lower consumer welfare in equilibrium.</span>

                    <span>A well-being approach requires looking beyond COVID-19 deaths to compare the performance of elimination versus mitigation strategies as measured by other important supports for well-being. What do the data show? Our comparison based on 2020 data shows a virus elimination strategy to be more successful than other options, whether measured in terms of COVID-19 deaths, overall excess deaths, income, unemployment, trust, or mental and physical health. Countries that chose and followed a strategy of reducing community transmission to zero and keeping it there saved lives and better protected income and employment, all without obvious costs to either the social fabric or the mental health of their populations.</span>

The removal ‘worked’ in this sense because it generated a large increase in gender-mismatched applications, and because those applications were treated surprisingly well by employers.  The removal had little or no effect on aggregate matching frictions.  The job titles that were integrated however, were not the most gendered ones, and were disproportionately lower-wage jobs.</span>

                    <span>In 1991, John Maynard Keynes wrote his famous tract The Economic Consequences of the Peace. In that work, he anticipated the collapse of the first era of globalization that began in the mid-nineteenth century. He admonished the short-sighted assumption that these years of relative peace and prosperity for many was a permanent norm, interrupted only briefly by the Great War. The diplomatic failures, lapses in leadership, and promotion of narrow interests and vision outlined by Keynes underpinned his prediction of a backslash of economic nationalism, trade protectionism, and recession.
The paper revisits the turning points in the evolution of the global economic system since 1919 by focusing primarily on the evolution of the international monetary system and policy cooperation/coordination. We identify three disruptions and examine how each prompted a change in the underlying ideology about how the international monetary system should organize: World War I, Bretton Woods, 1970s Great Inflation and Managed Floating. Each turning point was characterized by different forms and institutions of cooperation, how rules (either explicit or implicit) were designed and implemented, and the crucial importance of the historical context.</span>

                    <span>We develop an estimator and tests of a discrete time mixed proportional hazard (MPH) model of duration with unobserved heterogeneity. We allow for competing risks, observable characteristics, and censoring, and we use linear GMM, making estimation and inference straightforward. With repeated spell data, our estimator is consistent and robust to the unknown shape of the frailty distribution. We apply our estimator to the duration of price spells in weekly store data from IRI. We find substantial unobserved heterogeneity, accounting for a large fraction of the decrease in the Kaplan-Meier hazard with elapsed duration. Still, we show that the estimated baseline hazard rate is decreasing and a homogeneous firm model can accurately capture the response of the economy to a monetary policy shock even if there is significant strategic complementarity in pricing. Using competing risks and spell-specific observable characteristics, we separately estimate the model for regular and temporary price changes and find that the MPH structure describes regular price changes better than temporary ones.</span>

                    <span>This paper estimates the value of a statistical life (VSL), or the willingness to trade-off wealth and mortality risk, among 430,000 U.S. Army soldiers choosing whether to reenlist between 2002 and 2010. Using a discrete choice random utility approach and significant variation in retention bonuses and mortality risk, we recover average VSL estimates that range between $500,000 and $900,000, an order of magnitude smaller than U.S. civilian labor market estimates. Additionally, we fulfill Rosen&#x27;s (1974) vision to recover indifference curves between wealth and non-market goods (e.g., mortality risk) and document substantial heterogeneity in preferences across types. We find that the VSL increases rapidly with mortality risk within type, and that soldiers in combat occupations have much lower VSLs than those in noncombat occupations. We estimate that the quadrupling of mortality risk from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars reduced annual welfare by $2,355 per soldier, roughly 8 percent of pay.</span>

                    <span>About one-fifth of paid workdays will be supplied from home in the post-pandemic economy, and more than one-fourth on an earnings-weighted basis. In view of this projection, we consider some implications of home internet access quality, exploiting data from the new Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes. Moving to high-quality, fully reliable home internet service for all Americans (“universal access”) would raise earnings-weighted labor productivity by an estimated 1.1% in the coming years. The implied output gains are $160 billion per year, or $4 trillion when capitalized at a 4% rate. Estimated flow output payoffs to universal access are nearly three times as large in economic disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our survey data also say that subjective well-being was higher during the pandemic for people with better home internet service conditional on age, employment status, earnings, working arrangements, and other controls. In short, universal access would raise productivity, and it would promote greater economic and social resilience during future disasters that inhibit travel and in-person interactions.</span>

                    <span>Upon assuming power for the first time in 1935, the Norwegian Labour Party delivered on its promise of a major schooling reform. The reform raised minimum instruction time in less developed rural areas and boosted the resources available to rural schools, reducing class size and increasing teacher salaries. We document that cohorts more intensively affected by the reform significantly increased their education and experienced higher labor income. Our main result is that the schooling reform also substantially increased support for the Norwegian Labour Party in subsequent elections. This additional support persisted for several decades and was pivotal in maintaining support for the social democratic coalition in Norway. These results are not driven by the direct impact of education and are not explained by higher turnout, or greater attention or resources from the Labour Party targeted towards the municipalities most affected by the reform. Rather, our evidence suggests that cohorts that benefited from the schooling reform, and their parents, rewarded the party for delivering a major reform that was beneficial to them.</span>

The model features a liquid asset and illiquid home equity, which households can use as collateral for borrowing. Because present bias substantially increases households&#x27; marginal propensity to consume (MPC), present bias increases the impact of fiscal policy. Present bias also amplifies the effect of monetary policy but, at the same time, slows down the speed of monetary transmission. Interest rate cuts incentivize households to conduct cash-out refinances, which become targeted liquidity-injections to high-MPC households. But present bias also introduces a motive for households to procrastinate refinancing their mortgages, which slows down the speed with which this monetary channel operates.</span>

We show that repo rates rose above efficient-market levels when the total reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve by the largest repo-active bank holding companies declined and that repo rate spikes are strongly associated with delayed intraday payments of reserves to these large bank holding companies. Intraday payment timing stresses are magnified by early-morning settlement of Treasury security issuances. Substantially higher aggregate levels of reserves than existed in the period leading up to September 2019 would likely have eliminated most or all of these payment timing stresses and repo rate spikes.</span>

                    <span>Recent studies have concluded that state laws legalizing medical marijuana can reduce deaths from opioid overdoses.  Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a survey uniquely suited to assessing drug misuse, we examine the relationship between recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) and the use of opioids.  Standard difference-in-differences (DD) regression estimates indicate that RMLs do not affect the likelihood of misusing prescription pain relievers such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin.  Although DD regression estimates provide evidence that state laws legalizing recreational marijuana can reduce the frequency of misusing prescription pain relievers, event-study estimates are noisy and suggest that any effect on the frequency of misuse is likely transitory.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has posed governments with many ethical questions regarding lockdowns and vaccine prioritisation. Policies involve difficult health and income trade-offs, and the consequences are heterogeneously distributed across the population. This column analyses the implications of benefit-cost analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and social welfare function analysis in the context of Covid-19. It argues that the social welfare function approach is more appealing than traditional methods because it explicitly accounts for societal inequalities and the distribution of policy impacts in the population.</span>

                    <span>Many countries turned to use contact-tracing apps to help control the spread of COVID-19. Despite public policy efforts, however, tracking apps have not been a success because of public concerns over data privacy. This column compares nine countries to explore the conditions behind the successful use of digital technologies and AI for public purposes. Individuals give over personal data to internet companies but are wary of sharing their data for the public interest. Citizen trust in public interventions and commitment to social goals need to be nurtured in normal times to be effective in emergencies.</span>

• Schedule for Week of August 1, 2021
• A Few Comments on Inflation
Monday:
• At 10:00 AM ET, ISM Manufacturing Index for July. The consensus is for the ISM to be at 60.9, up from 60.6 in June. The employment index was at 49.9% in June, and the new orders index was at 66.0%.
• Also at 10:00 AM, Construction Spending for June. The consensus is for a 0.4% increase in construction spending.
• At 2:00 PM, Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices for July.
From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 are up 19 and DOW futures are up 135 (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $73.85 per barrel and Brent at $75.26 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $40, and Brent was at $43 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 80% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic). 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.16 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.18 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $0.98 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t commented much on inflation because I do not consider inflation a serious economic problem. 

However, I&#x27;m aware some people - like Larry Summers and Mohammed El-Erian are concerned.   El-Erian was quoted in a recent Bloomberg article: 
“Inflation is not going to be transitory,” the chief economic adviser at Allianz SE said in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s The Open show ... “I have a whole list of companies that have announced price increases, that have told us they expect further price increases, and that they expect them to stick,” El-Erian said.
First, transitory doesn&#x27;t mean that price increases won&#x27;t &quot;stick&quot;.  It means that year-over-year (YoY) inflation will decline back to the Fed&#x27;s target of 2%.
The first graph shows the PCE price index since January 2020 (before the pandemic), and the dashed blue line is the Fed&#x27;s target of 2%.
 Click on graph for larger image.
As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, there was some deflation at the beginning of the pandemic, and this has increased the YoY change (base effect).   There is some transitory inflation from supply chain issues, and surging rents will probably push up Owners Equivalent Rent (OER) over the next year.

But overall the PCE price index isn&#x27;t that far above what we would have expected 18 months ago!  
 The second graph is from January 2005 (just an arbitrary date).
This shows that inflation has been below target for years.  If we were doing price targeting (we aren&#x27;t) we would be looking for more price increases.
The graphs for core PCE inflation show the same pattern.
The question is not will some prices &quot;stick&quot;, but rather will YoY inflation ease back towards the Fed&#x27;s target?  Or will inflation stay at the current 4.0% (PCE YoY in June)?
My sense is inflation will ease back towards the Fed&#x27;s target.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education requires a solid grasp of the impact of student autonomy on learning. This column examines the impacts of an innovative policy in Greece that provided higher-performing students with more autonomy. Targeted students missed more classes, while lower-performing students’ attendance remained unchanged. The autonomy policy was used more by students in academically diverse classrooms, and is associated with increased performance only in high-stakes subjects for targeted students.</span>

                    <span>Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family Serious Delinquency decreased to 2.08% in June, from 2.24% in May. The serious delinquency rate is down from 2.65% in June 2020.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
Click on graph for larger image
By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 5.04% are seriously delinquent (down from 5.27% in May).  For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 8.75% are seriously delinquent (down from 9.09%),  For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.69% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.82%). So Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once they are employed.
Note: Freddie Mac reported earlier.</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of July 27th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances See Weekly Rise
After the last couple of weeks of volumes remaining flat, we did see some movement in the number of active forbearance plans this past week. According to our McDash Flash daily Forbearance Tracker data, the total number of active plans is up by 31,000 since last Tuesday.
Such upward movement late in the month has been relatively common in the recovery to date. Plan removals are clustered early in the month, which tends to lead to some degree of restart activity as the month progresses.
Despite this increase, there are still 163,000 (-7.9%) fewer plans than at the same time last month. As of July 27, 1.9 million borrowers remain in COVID-19 forbearance plans, making up 3.6% of all active mortgages and 2.0% of GSE, 6.3% of FHA/VA and 4.4% of Portfolio/PLS loans.

Forbearances rose most significantly among loans held in bank portfolios or private label securities – which were up 35,000 for the week – with FHA/VA mortgages seeing a slight uptick in plans as well (+1,000). The 5,000-plan decline among GSE loans offset just a small share of the total weekly rise.
There are still some 179,000 plans are still scheduled to be reviewed for extension/removal in July, which provides some substantial opportunity for improvement next week.
While still low, new forbearance plan starts hit their highest weekly level since late March, with restart activity also remaining elevated. Roughly 2/3 of all starts over the past week were restarts. Removal volumes were the lowest since late May given the low volume of review activity at this time of month.

                    <span>Circular Economy literature recommends longer lasting products, in order to reduce pollution from extraction, production, and disposal. Our economic analysis finds conditions where consumers choose lives that are too short – a “durability gap”. Then policies targeting durability raise welfare. While externalities are corrected by Pigovian taxes that ignore durability, raising the output tax nonetheless induces consumers to pay more for goods that last longer. Second, if the tax is suboptimal, a durability mandate raises welfare. Third, internalities have ambiguous effects. Fourth, a social discount rate less than private discount rate is the strongest case for policy to favor durability.</span>

The program improves outcomes of the first-generation treatment group across the life cycle, which translates into better family environments for the second generation leading to positive intergenerational gains. There are long-lasting beneficial program effects on cognition through age 54, contradicting claims of fadeout that have dominated popular discussions of early childhood programs. Children of the first-generation treatment group have higher levels of education and employment, lower levels of criminal activity, and better health than children of the first-generation control group.</span>

The uncovered dynamics of consumption implies modestly upward sloping real bond and equity curves, upward sloping nominal yield curve, and sign-switching correlation between equities and bonds consistent with the stylized facts. This is achieved without relying on the nominal channel too much. That is, as in the data, the variation of inflation in the model is under 40% as a fraction of variation in nominal yields.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have mobilized targeted social assistance programs. Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need? This challenge is particularly acute in the large number of LMICs that lack recent and comprehensive data on household income and wealth. Here we show that non-traditional “big” data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our approach uses traditional survey-based measures of consumption and wealth to train machine learning algorithms that recognize patterns of poverty in non-traditional data; the trained algorithms are then used to prioritize aid to the poorest regions and mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Novissi, Togo’s flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to determine eligibility for a rural assistance program that disbursed millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes – including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness – under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo at the time, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods that require a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to contribute to humanitarian response efforts, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.</span>

                    <span>Previous studies of the effect of ridesharing on traffic fatalities have yielded inconsistent, often contradictory conclusions. In this paper we revisit this question using proprietary data from Uber measuring monthly rideshare activity at the Census tract level. Most previous studies are based on publicly-available information about Uber entry dates into US cities, but we show that an indicator variable for whether Uber is available is a poor measure of rideshare activity — for example, it explains less than 3% of the tract-level variation in ridesharing, reflecting the enormous amount of variation both within and across cities. Using entry we find inconsistent and statistically insignificant estimates. However, when we use the more detailed proprietary data, we find a robust negative impact of ridesharing on traffic fatalities. Impacts concentrate during nights and weekends and are robust across a range of alternative specifications. Overall, our results imply that ridesharing has decreased US alcohol-related traffic fatalities by 6.1% and reduced total US traffic fatalities by 4.0%. Based on conventional estimates of the value of statistical life the annual life-saving benefits range from $2.3 to $5.4 billion. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that these benefits may be of similar magnitude to producer surplus captured by Uber shareholders or consumer surplus captured by Uber riders.</span>

                    <span>We argue that the Covid epidemic disproportionately affected the economic well-being and health of poor people. To disentangle the forces that generated this outcome, we construct a model that is consistent with the heterogeneous impact of the Covid recession on low- and high-income people. According to our model, two thirds of the inequality in Covid deaths reflect pre-existing inequality in comorbidity rates and access to quality health care. The remaining third, stems from the fact that low-income people work in occupations where the risk of infection is high. Our model also implies that the rise in income inequality generated by the Covid epidemic reflects the nature of the goods that low-income people produce. Finally, we assess the health-income trade-offs associated with fiscal transfers to the poor and mandatory containment policies.</span>

                    <span>Investments in international fixed income securities are exposed to significant currency risks. We collect novel data on mutual fund currency derivatives and document that around 90% of U.S. international fixed income funds use currency forwards to manage their foreign exchange exposure. Funds&#x27; currency forward positions differ substantially based on risk management demands related to portfolio currency exposures, return-enhancement motives such as currency momentum and carry trade, and strategic considerations related to past performance and fund clienteles. Funds that hedge their currency risk exhibit lower return variability, but do not generate inferior abnormal returns.</span>

                    <span>Theoretically, wealthier people should buy less insurance, and should self-insure through saving instead, as insurance entails monitoring costs. Here, we use administrative data for 63,000 individuals and, contrary to theory, find that the wealthier have better life and property insurance coverage. Wealth-related differences in background risk, legal risk, liquidity constraints, financial literacy, and pricing explain only a small fraction of the positive wealth-insurance correlation. This puzzling correlation persists in individual fixed-effects models estimated using 2,500,000 person-month observations. The fact that the less wealthy have less coverage, though intuitively they benefit more from insurance, might increase financial health disparities among households.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies exacted a large economic toll on large portions of the United States population. For older and disabled workers, the effects could be more persistent and fiscally costly than the impacts experienced by young, healthy workers due to the spillovers onto Social Security. We use Current Population Survey, Social Security administrative data on applications for retirement and disability benefits, and Google Trends data to assess the impact of COVID-19 on older adults age 50-70. We find that employment for this group dropped substantially more than would have been predicted prior to the pandemic: employment for 50-61 year olds was 5.7 pp (8.3 percent) lower, while employment for 62-70-year- olds was 3.9 pp (10.7 percent) lower. For people aged 50-61, unemployment and labor force exits due to reasons other than disability and retirement represented 63 and 30 percent of the employment decline, respectively. For those aged 62-70, the two largest components of the reduction were unemployment (50 percent) and retirement-driven labor force exits (30 percent). We find evidence of declines in reporting a labor force exit due to disability (4-5 percent), applications for disability insurance (15 percent), and Google search intensity for disability (7 percent). Retirement benefit claiming remains largely unchanged overall, though we find evidence that applicants substituted towards filing for benefits via the internet. We explore potential mechanisms and find evidence for both supply- and demand-side explanations.</span>

                    <span>How do people arrange themselves when they are free to choose work and residence locations, when commuting is costly, and when increasing returns may affect production? We consider this problem when the location set is discrete and households have heterogenous preferences over workplace-residence pairs. We provide a general characterization of equilibrium throughout the parameter space. The introduction of preference heterogeneity into an otherwise conventional urban model fundamentally changes equilibrium behavior. Multiple equilibria are pervasive although stable equilibria need not exist. Stronger increasing returns to scale need not concentrate economic activity and lower commuting costs need not disperse it. The qualitative behavior of the model as returns to scale increase accords with changes in the patterns of urbanization observed in the Western world between the pre-industrial period and the present.</span>

                    <span>This paper estimates the impact on consumer behavior of a firm’s voluntary disclosure of information. Specifically, we study the impact of Starbucks’ disclosure of calorie information on its menu boards in June 2013. Using data on over 250,000 consumers’ visits to specific restaurant chains, we estimate difference-in-difference models that compare the change in the probability that consumers recently visited Starbucks to the change in the probability that they recently visited a similar chain that did not voluntarily disclose: Dunkin Donuts. Estimates from difference-in-differences models indicate that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that Starbucks’ disclosure of calorie information had no impact on the probability that consumers patronized Starbucks in the past month. However, we find evidence of a transitory negative impact on the probability of visits the first year after disclosure, and evidence that disclosure reduced the probability of visits by men. These results are useful for understanding how consumers respond to the voluntary disclosure of information, a decision faced by many firms.</span>

I first discuss the neuroscientific foundations of experience-based learning and sketch a simple model of its role in the stock market based on Malmendier et al. (2020a,b). I then distill the empirical findings on experience effects in stock-market investment, trade dynamics, and international capital flows, highlighting these four key features. Finally, I contrast models of belief formation that rely on “learned information” with models accounting for the neuroscience evidence on synaptic tagging and memory formation, and provide directions for future research.</span>

                    <span>Are market experts prone to heuristics, and if so, do they transfer across closely related domains—buying and selling? We investigate this question using a unique dataset of institutional investors with portfolios averaging $573 million. A striking finding emerges: while there is clear evidence of skill in buying, selling decisions underperform substantially—even relative to random selling strategies. This holds despite the similarity between the two decisions in frequency, substance and consequences for performance. Evidence suggests that an asymmetric allocation of cognitive resources such as attention can explain the discrepancy: we document a systematic, costly heuristic process when selling but not when buying.</span>

                    <span>The coronavirus is a global event of historical proportions and just a few months changed the time series properties of the data in ways that make many pre-covid forecasting models inadequate. It also creates a new problem for estimation of economic factors and dynamic causal effects because the variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the latter view and use covid indicators as controls to &#x27;de-covid&#x27; the data prior to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020 even though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty has receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or indirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock, and distinguishing between the two types of shocks can be important in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.</span>

We estimate the model using data from almost 10 million retail accounts in the Indian stock market. We find that stock characteristics such as firm age and share price have strong investor clienteles associated with them. Similarly, account attributes such as account age, account size, and extreme underdiversification (holding a single stock) are associated with particular characteristic preferences. Coheld stocks tend to have higher return covariance, suggestive of the importance of clientele effects in the stock market.</span>

In reality, this is only true on a relative basis when compared to other bonds, but is often not true on an absolute basis. Many Treasuries have repeatedly traded at substantial discounts to their intrinsic fair values for extended periods during the past 25 years. Since 2015, Treasuries have consistently been priced at an aggregate discount of $100 to $300 billion below their fair values. Treasuries often actually become cheaper following crises.

                    <span>We study the results of a massive nationwide correspondence experiment sending more than 83,000 fictitious applications with randomized characteristics to geographically dispersed jobs posted by 108 of the largest U.S. employers. Distinctively Black names reduce the probability of employer contact by 2.1 percentage points relative to distinctively white names. The magnitude of this racial gap in contact rates differs substantially across firms, exhibiting a between-company standard deviation of 1.9 percentage points. Despite an insignificant average gap in contact rates between male and female applicants, we find a between-company standard deviation in gender contact gaps of 2.7 percentage points, revealing that some firms favor male applicants while others favor women. Company-specific racial contact gaps are temporally and spatially persistent, and negatively correlated with firm profitability, federal contractor status, and a measure of recruiting centralization. Discrimination exhibits little geographical dispersion, but two digit industry explains roughly half of the cross-firm variation in both racial and gender contact gaps. Contact gaps are highly concentrated in particular companies, with firms in the top quintile of racial discrimination responsible for nearly half of lost contacts to Black applicants in the experiment. Controlling false discovery rates to the 5% level, 23 individual companies are found to discriminate against Black applicants. Our findings establish that systemic illegal discrimination is concentrated among a select set of large employers, many of which can be identified with high confidence using large scale inference methods.</span>

                    <span>Electric vehicles are declining in cost so rapidly that they may claim a large share of the vehicle market by 2030. This paper examines a set of practical regulatory design considerations for fuel-economy standards or greenhouse gas standards in the context of highly uncertain electric vehicle costs in the next decade. The analysis takes a cost-effectiveness approach and uses analytical modeling and simulation to develop insight. I show that counting electric vehicles under a standard with a multiplier or assuming zero upstream emissions can reduce electric vehicle market share by weakening the standards. Further, there are tradeoffs from implementing a backstop conventional vehicle standard along with a second standard that also includes electric vehicles, but such a backstop offers the possibility of ensuring that low-cost conventional vehicle technologies are exploited.</span>

It is shown that policy interventions that directly target costs associated with vaccine adoption may counter vaccine hesitancy while those that manipulate the utility of unvaccinated agents will either lead to the same or lower rates of vaccine adoption. This latter effect arises with vaccine passports whose effects are mitigated in equilibrium by reductions in viral/disease prevalence that themselves reduce the demand for vaccination.</span>

                    <span>This paper shows that local productivity spillovers propagate throughout the economy through the plant-level networks of multi-region firms. Using confidential Census plant-level data, we show that large manufacturing plant openings not only raise the productivity of local plants but also of distant plants hundreds of miles away, which belong to multi-region firms that are exposed to the local productivity spillover through one of their plants. To quantify the significance of plant-level networks for the propagation and amplification of local productivity shocks, we develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model in which plants of multi-region firms are linked through shared knowledge. Our model features heterogeneous regions, which interact through goods trade and labor markets, as well as within-location, across-plant heterogeneity in productivity, wages, and employment. Counterfactual exercises show that while knowledge sharing through plant-level networks amplifies the aggregate effects of local productivity shocks, it widens economic disparities between individual workers and regions in the economy.</span>

                    <span>Many government services are provided at the state level such as unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and SNAP. Given the lack of competition, a natural worry is that customer support provided by states for these services is less than adequate. While there are many different measures of how a state can support beneficiaries, we focus on just one in this short and applied report: the ability to get a live representative on the phone to help with an application question. To do this, we take a “mystery shopping” approach and make 2,000 phone calls to state government offices. We find substantial heterogeneity in the availability of live phone representatives across states and types of service (UI, Medicaid, etc.). For example, live representatives in New Jersey and Georgia were reached less than 20% of the time while representatives in New Hampshire and Wisconsin were reached more than 80% of the time. We hope that this report provides a simple example for how academics, investigative reporters, and watch groups can help states be more accountable for their customer support systems.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies how increasing teacher compensation at hard-to-staff schools can reduce inequality in access to qualified teachers. Leveraging an unconditional change in the teacher compensation structure in Peru, we first show causal evidence that increasing salaries at less desirable locations attracts better quality applicants and improves student test scores. We then estimate a model of teacher preferences over local amenities, school characteristics, and wages using geocoded job postings and rich application data from the nationwide centralized teacher assignment system. Our estimated model suggests that the current policy is helpful but both inefficient and not large enough to effectively undo the inequality of initial conditions that hard-to-staff schools and their communities face. Counterfactual analyses that incorporate equilibrium sorting effects characterize alternative wage schedules and quantify the cost of reducing structural inequality in the allocation of teacher talent across schools. Overall our results show that a policy that sets compensation at each job posting using the information generated by the matching platform is more efficient and can help reduce structural inequality in access to learning opportunities. In comparison, a rigid system that ignores teacher preferences will indirectly reinforce such inequalities.</span>

                    <span>The recent Supreme Court decision NCAA vs Alston (June 2021) has heightened interest in the benefits and costs of participation in sports for student athletes. Anecdotes about the exploitation of student athletes were cited in the opinion. This paper uses panel data for two different cohorts that follow students from high school through college and into their post-school pursuits to examine the generality of these anecdotes. On average, student athletes’ benefit—often substantially so—in terms of graduation, post-collegiate employment, and earnings. Benefits in terms of social mobility for disadvantaged and minority students are substantial, contrary to the anecdotes in play in the media and in the courts.</span>

We estimate the long-run impacts of the urban version of Familias en Acción, the Colombian CCT program on crime, teenage pregnancy, high school dropout and college enrollment using a Regression Discontinuity design on administrative data. ITT estimates show a reduction on arrest rates of 2.7pp for men and a reduction on teenage pregnancy of 2.3pp for women. High school dropout rates were reduced by 5.8pp and college enrollment was increased by 1.7pp for men.</span>

                    <span>Economic activity in developing countries is labor-intensive, low-scale, and family run, with substantial family managerial time spent supervising hired labor. We use a randomized control trial that subsidizes access to rental equipment markets to study the impact of the adoption of mechanized practices on  labor demand, productivity and managerial span of control. The intervention induces greater mechanization in the upstream production stage, and labor savings concentrated in downstream, non-mechanized stages. The reduction in worker supervision needs increases the span of control and allows households to increase non-agricultural income. We use the experimental elasticities to estimate a structural model where farmers make labor supply decisions in the family enterprise and outside of it. The consumption-equivalent welfare from the intervention amounts to 0.9%. The model provides structural estimates of the marginal return to capital at 8.8%, and the shadow value of family labor, 20% below their outside option in non-agriculture.</span>

                    <span>The design and conduct of climate change policy necessarily confronts uncertainty along multiple fronts. We explore the consequences of ambiguity over various sources and configurations of models that impact how economic opportunities could be damaged in the future. We appeal to decision theory under risk, model ambiguity and misspecification concerns to provide an economically motivated approach to uncertainty quantification. We show how this approach reduces the many facets of uncertainty into a low dimensional characterization that depends on the uncertainty aversion of a decision-maker or fictitious social planner.  In our computations, we take inventory of three alternative channels of uncertainty and provide a novel way to assess them. These include i) carbon dynamics that capture how carbon emissions impact atmospheric carbon in future time periods; ii) temperature dynamics that depict how atmospheric carbon alters temperature in future time periods; iii) damage functions that quantify how temperature changes diminish economic opportunities. We appeal to geoscientific modeling to quantify the first two channels. We show how these uncertainty sources interact for a social planner looking to design a prudent approach to the social pricing of carbon emissions.</span>

                    <span>This study estimated the effects of welfare reform in the 1990s, which permanently restructured and contracted the cash assistance system in the U.S., on food insecurity—a fundamental form of hardship—of the next generation of households. An implicit goal underlying welfare reform was the disruption of an assumed intergenerational transmission of disadvantage; however, little is known about the effects of welfare reform on the well-being of the next generation. Using intergenerational data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a variation on a difference-in-differences framework, this study exploits 3 sources of variation in childhood exposure to welfare reform: (1) risk of exposure across birth cohorts; (2) variation of exposure within cohorts because different states implemented welfare reform in different years; and (3) variation between individuals with the same exposure who were more likely and less likely to rely on welfare. We found that exposure to welfare reform led to decreases in food insecurity of the next generation of households, by about 10% for a 5-year increase in exposure, with stronger effects for women, individuals exposed for longer durations during childhood, individuals exposed in early childhood (0-5 years), and individuals whose mothers had a high school education (versus less).</span>

                    <span>Attitudes towards same-sex relationships in the US have changed radically over a relatively short period of time. After remaining fairly constant for over two decades, opinions became more favorable starting in 1992—a presidential election year in which the Democratic and Republican parties took opposing stands over the status of gay people in society. What roles did political parties and their leaders play in this process of cultural change? Using a variety of techniques including machine learning, we show that the partisan opinion gap emerged substantially prior to 1992—in the mid 1980s —and did not increase as a result of the political debates in 1992-&#x27;93. Furthermore, we identify people with a college-and-above education as the potential &quot;leaders&quot; of the process of partisan divergence.</span>

                    <span>In response to the Covid-19 crisis, 186 countries implemented direct cash transfers to households, and 181 introduced in-kind programs that lowered the cost of utilities such as electricity, water, transport, and mobile money. Do cash or in-kind transfers generate greater welfare improvements? And, does a country’s financial infrastructure affect optimal aid disbursement? Through a parallel set of surveys in two urban regions in Africa—with comparable education, cell phone ownership, and electricity connectivity—we show that optimal government aid disbursement hinges on financial infrastructure. In line with economic theory favoring direct cash transfers, in a randomized experiment in Kenya 95% of urban recipients prefer mobile money over electricity transfers of a similar monetary value. But Kenya is an outlier with high mobile money adoption: this increases its value and reduces transaction costs of buying electricity credit. By contrast, in Ghana—where mobile money is less widespread and the transaction costs for buying electricity are higher—half of recipients prefer electricity transfers, and many are willing to forego significant value to receive electricity instead of mobile money. These results have several important policy implications. First, the optimal government policy in response to an economic crisis is not uniform: cash and in-kind transfers have different advantages that make each suitable for specific contexts. Second, the adoption of modern financial technologies will likely increase the efficiency of government cash transfer programs, even as in-kind transfers continue to be preferred in settings where mobile money uptake is slow. Finally, giving recipients a choice harnesses valuable local information that a policy maker may not have access to.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we use a unique two-stage experiment that randomized access to school vouchers across both markets and students in rural India to estimate the revealed preference value of school choice. In the first step of the research design, we develop an empirical model of school choice subject to liquidity and credit constraints that is estimated using data from only the control markets. Based on this exercise, we estimate that the voucher generated welfare gains exceeding four times the average private school&#x27;s annual tuition on average to the students induced into private schooling. The second step of the research design will validate the estimated welfare impacts by comparing model predictions for a simulated voucher program in control markets with the data from the treatment group. The results in this paper are based on the first step (using only control data) and this draft serves as a pre-commitment to the model estimates and predictions before examining the experimental data.</span>

Notably we revisit a randomized CDD program in Sierra Leone 11 years after launch. We estimate large persistent gains in local public goods and market activity, and modest positive effects on institutions. There is suggestive evidence that CDD slightly improved communities’ response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic. We compare estimates to the forecasts of experts from Sierra Leone and abroad, working in policy and academia, and find that local policymakers are overly optimistic about CDD’s effectiveness.</span>

Conglomerate spillovers account for 40% of the output loss of regulated firms and substantially reduce aggregate energy savings. Using a structural model, we show that alternative polices that use public information on business networks could lower the shadow cost of the regulation by more than 40% and increase aggregate energy savings by 10%.</span>

                    <span>A predominant example of moral hazard is the application of limited liability to the shareholders of publicly listed private-sector corporations. This column argues that changing the incentives for senior employees and majority shareholders for listed firms may be the most effective form of regulation. The author suggests that creating a system where managerial staff and other shareholders are incentivised to adhere to best practice to protect themselves, as well as the firm in question, is optimal.</span>

                    <span>With economic globalisation facing a legitimacy crisis fuelled by various scandals associated with globalised value chains, advocacy NGOs and their campaigns are in the limelight. Still, little systematic knowledge has been generated on how global sourcing and exporting decisions of firms interact with the upsurge of this international social activism. This column uses a unique dataset on NGO campaigns against firms to show how the internationalisation and geographical structure of NGO campaigns are closely intertwined with patterns of global production and trade.</span>

Marking the sixth consecutive month of MoM gains, June saw the destination host more than 2.9 million visitors, +3.2% MoM and down ‐17.6% vs. June 2019.
  
While convention and group data continue to be gathered, the return of several conventions including World of Concrete, Surfaces, Nightclub &amp; Bar and the Int&#x27;l Esthetics, Cosmetics &amp; Spa Conference helped support midweek business.
Hotel occupancy continued to improve, reaching 75.9% (up 5.0 pts MoM, down ‐15.8 pts vs. June 2019), as Weekend occupancy neared 90% (89.4%) and Midweek occupancy reached 70.9% (up 8.1 pts MoM, down ‐18.8 pts vs. June 2019.)

The first graph shows visitor traffic for 2019 (blue), 2020 (orange) and 2021 (red).
Visitor traffic was down 17.6% compared to the same month in 2019.
  
There had been no convention traffic since March 2020, but there were a few conventions in June (data not available yet).


I&#x27;ll add a graph of convention traffic once convention data is available.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 7.8% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Occupancy Reaches Highest Level Since October 2019
U.S. weekly hotel occupancy reached its highest level since October 2019, while room rates hit an all-time high, according to STR‘s latest data through July 24.
July 18-24, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 71.4% (-7.8%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $141.75 (+4.0%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $101.24 (-4.2%)
 Historically, the middle weeks of July are the country’s highest occupancy weeks each year, and 2021 has been no different even as demand slows week to week.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months have had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.</span>

                    <span>From the NAR: Pending Home Sales Fall 1.9% in June
Pending home sales declined marginally in June after recording a notable gain in May, the National Association of Realtors® reported. Contract activity was split in the four major U.S. regions from both a year-over-year and month-over-month perspective. The Northeast recorded the only yearly gains in June.
  
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, fell 1.9% to 112.8 in June. Year-over-year, signings also slipped 1.9%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
The Northeast PHSI increased 0.5% to 98.5 in June, an 8.7% rise from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index grew 0.6% to 108.3 last month, down 2.4% from June 2020.
  
Pending home sales transactions in the South fell 3.0% to an index of 132.4 in June, down 4.7% from June 2020. The index in the West decreased 3.8% in June to 98.1, down 2.6% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was below expectations of a 0.5% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in July and August.</span>

The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected increases in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by decreases in private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and federal government spending.

                    <span>Model-based studies on the effect of carbon taxation point to sizeable inflationary effects. This column uses evidence from Canada and Europe over the past three decades to show that carbon taxes changed relative prices but did not increase the overall price level. Instead, they were slightly deflationary. In the case of British Columbia, the driver may have been a fall in household income depressing the prices of non-energy goods, which more than offset rising energy prices. The income compression was most pronounced among the richest households, suggesting that the redistribution scheme achieved its intended aim of favouring low-income households.</span>

                    <span>Historical institutions can have long-lasting effects on societies and economies. The Inca Road has been a linchpin of the colonial economy in the New World, but its impact on current development has not been studied in great depth. This column examines the impact of the road on today’s educational, development, and labour outcomes. Proximity to the Inca Road increased the average level of educational attainment and decreased stunting among children by 5%. It boosted average hourly wages by 20% and reduced informality by six percentage points. Moreover, these eﬀects were around 40% greater among women.</span>

                    <span>Aggregate US bank lending to firms tends to expand following adverse macroeconomic shocks, such as the outbreak of COVID-19 or a monetary policy tightening. Based on detailed loan-level supervisory data, this column shows that these responses are almost entirely explained by large firms drawing on their bank credit lines. However, funding stability for large firms may imply that smaller firms face tighter borrowing conditions. The authors show that such a crowding out effect was at play during the COVID-19 crisis and explore the implications of such spillovers within a structural model.</span>

FOMC Statement: 
The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.
 With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

                    <span>The Case-Shiller house price indexes for May were released yesterday.   Zillow forecasts Case-Shiller a month early, and I like to check the Zillow forecasts since they have been pretty close.
From Matthew Speakman at Zillow: May 2021 Case-Shiller Results &amp; Forecast: Growth Continues Climb
The forces that have propelled home price growth to new highs over the past year remain in place and are offering little evidence of abating.
...
The housing market’s historically tight inventory conditions finally started to ease in May, but that did little to immediately tame the record-strong home price appreciation that the market has experienced in recent months. The number available homes across the nation finally ticked up this spring, albeit from a historically low reference point, after spending most of the last year in a steady decline. Still, price pressures remain very firm and appear ready to stay that way in the months to come. Indeed, sharply-rising prices do appear to have priced out some home shoppers, particularly those looking to enter the market for the first time, and causing fatigue among would-be buyers. But overall demand for homes remains very firm, as bidding wars persist and the still-relatively few homes available for sales continue to fly off the shelves at a historically fast pace. Increased inventory levels should eventually help tame the record-high pace of price appreciation, but it’s going to take a while.
Monthly and annual growth in June as reported by Case-Shiller is expected to decelerate from May and April 2020 in all three main indices. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is expected to release data for the June S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices on Tuesday, August 24.
emphasis added
The Zillow forecast is for the year-over-year change for the Case-Shiller National index to be at 16.2% in June, from 16.6% in May. 
The Zillow forecast is for the 20-City index to be up 16.5% YoY in June from 17.0% in May, and for the 10-City index to be up 16.1% YoY compared to 16.4% YoY in May.</span>

                    <span>A few key points:
1) There is a clear seasonal pattern for house prices.
2) The surge in distressed sales during the housing bust distorted the seasonal pattern.
3) Even though distressed sales are down significantly, the seasonal factor is based on several years of data - and the factor is now closer to normal (second graph below).
4) Still the seasonal index is probably a better indicator of actual price movements than the Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) index.
For in depth description of these issues, see Jed Kolko&#x27;s article from 2014 (currently Chief Economist at Indeed) &quot;Let’s Improve, Not Ignore, Seasonal Adjustment of Housing Data&quot;
Note: I was one of several people to question the change in the seasonal factor (here is a post in 2009) - and this led to S&amp;P Case-Shiller questioning the seasonal factor too (from April 2010).  I still use the seasonal factor (I think it is better than using the NSA data).
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows the month-to-month change in the NSA Case-Shiller National index since 1987 (through May 2021). The seasonal pattern was smaller back in the &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s, and increased once the bubble burst. 
The seasonal swings declined following the bubble, however the recent price surge changed the month-over-month pattern.
The second graph shows the seasonal factors for the Case-Shiller National index since 1987.  The factors started to change near the peak of the bubble, and really increased during the bust.   
The swings in the seasonal factors have decreased, and the seasonal factors has been moving back towards more normal levels.

Note that the recent price surge hasn&#x27;t distorted the seasonal factors.</span>

4차 산업혁명은 시간과 공간의 경계를 허물고, 금융시장의 국제화도 가속화하였다. 투자의사결정은 장기적이고, 전략적인 의사결정이다. 국내시장만 바라볼 것이 아니라 국제금융시장을 이해하고, 해석할 수 있는 힘을 키워야 투자에 성공할 수 있다. 누구나 아는 투자의 기본원칙은 있다. 분산투자, 장기투자 등이 그것이다. 이러한 기본원칙들에 대한 기초적인 이론들을 정리한 책이다. 이러한 이론들은 실제 국제금융투자에서 접하는 질문들에 대한 답을 찾는 데 필요한 필수적인 틀을 제공할 것이다.

                    <span>In order to limit global climate change, the world may eventually need to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it puts in (&#x27;negative emissions&#x27;). Economists almost universally recommend pricing carbon emissions via a tax or cap, but this policy cannot achieve negative emissions unless paired with potentially massive government spending. This column argues that an alternate type of policy, called &#x27;carbon shares&#x27;, can limit emissions as efficiently as carbon taxes or caps while also properly incentivising negative emissions.</span>

This column introduces a new dataset that helps understand the contribution of services to global value chains and their role in the process of exporting goods. Firms with longer experience in exporting goods to a destination tend to source export-related service inputs from there rather than domestically, and do so within the boundaries of the business group rather than at arm’s length.</span>

                    <span>International trade is a key determinant of firm profitability and survival, so it is natural to expect it to influence both incentives to innovate and the rate of creative destruction. This column highlights four key mechanisms through which international trade affects endogenous innovation and growth: market size, competition, comparative advantage, and knowledge spillovers. Each of these mechanisms offers potential static and dynamic welfare gains. Discriminating between alternative mechanisms for these dynamic welfare gains and strengthening the evidence on their quantitative magnitude remain exciting areas of ongoing research.</span>

                    <span>Watching existing home &quot;for sale&quot; inventory is very helpful.  As an example, the increase in inventory in late 2005 helped me call the top for housing.
And the decrease in inventory eventually helped me correctly call the bottom for house prices in early 2012, see: The Housing Bottom is Here.
And in 2015, it appeared the inventory build in several markets was ending, and that boosted price increases.  

In 2020, with the pandemic, inventory dropped to record lows, and prices really increased (record low mortgage rates and demographics were factors too).
I don&#x27;t have a crystal ball, but watching inventory helps understand the housing market.

This graph below shows existing home months-of-supply (inverted, from the NAR) vs. the seasonally adjusted month-to-month price change in the Case-Shiller National Index (both since January 1999 through May 2021).


There is a clear relationship, and this is no surprise (but interesting to graph).  If months-of-supply is high, prices decline.  If months-of-supply is very low (like now), prices rise quickly.


In May, the months-of-supply was at 2.5 months, and the Case-Shiller National Index (SA) increased 1.7% month-over-month (a month-over-month record).  The black arrow points to the May dot.
In the June existing home sales report released last week, the NAR reported months-of-supply increased to 2.6 month in June.  There is a seasonal pattern to inventory, but this is still very low - and prices are increasing sharply.</span>

It has been over fifteen years since the bubble peak.  In the Case-Shiller release today, the seasonally adjusted National Index (SA), was reported as being 38% above the previous bubble peak.  However, in real terms, the National index (SA) is about 6% above the bubble peak (and historically there has been an upward slope to real house prices).  The composite 20, in real terms, is still 2% below the bubble peak.

The year-over-year growth in prices increased to 16.6% nationally.
Usually people graph nominal house prices, but it is also important to look at prices in real terms (inflation adjusted).  Case-Shiller and others report nominal house prices.  As an example, if…</span>

                    <span>The Census Bureau released the Residential Vacancies and Homeownership report for Q2 2021.
It is likely the results of this survey were significantly distorted by the pandemic.  

This report is frequently mentioned by analysts and the media to track household formation, the homeownership rate, and the homeowner and rental vacancy rates.  However, there are serious questions about the accuracy of this survey.
This survey might show the trend, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on the absolute numbers. Analysts probably shouldn&#x27;t use the HVS to estimate the excess vacant supply or household formation, or rely on the homeownership rate, except as a guide to the trend.

It was a slow trading day for the most part until the last 90 minutes.  ...  As the day wound down, yields bumped up to the highs--right in line with the 1.295% technical level--and MBS coughed up a quick eighth of a point.  That was enough for several lenders to reprice for the worse even though the weakness doesn&#x27;t speak to any bigger picture issues.  ... [30 year fixed 2.86%]

21세기의 극적인 자산불평등은 최근 그 어느 때보다 많은 논쟁의 대상이 되고 있다. 세계적으로 자산집중은 점차 거대해지는 추세이다. 수많은 사람들이 하루 1달러로 생계를 유지하는 동안 극소수의 과도한 부자들이 수백억 달러의 자산을 소유하고 있는 상황은 감정적 동요를 불러일으킨다. 

정치가 부자들의 자산집중에 소극적으로 대응하고 부자들에게 유리한 감정정치를 펼친 결과 사람들은 과도한 부자들의 특혜를 수용하는 경향을 갖게 된다. 질투와 증오는 가난한 사람들의 몫이 되고 아량과 동정은 부자들의 미덕이 된다. 그러나 부유한 자들의 박애주의는 과도한 부의 사회적 문제를 보이지 않게끔 만든다. 정의로운 사회를 바라는 사람이라면 자산집중 현상이 어떻게 인식되는지를 이해해야 한다. 과도한 부는 정의원칙을 훼손할 뿐만 아니라 민주주의를 위협하기 때문이다. 

그렇다면 과도한 부에 대항하여 일보 전진하는 방법은 무엇일까? 가난한 사람들의 자산자료는 여러 곳에서 얻을 수 있는 반면, 과도한 부자들의 자산자료는 아주 기초적인 정보조차 숨겨져 있는 상황이다. 저자 마르틴 쉬르츠는 편중된 부에 대한 올바른 논의가 사회적으로 일어나기 위한 선결조건으로서 명확한 자산자료의 확보를 제시한다.

그리고 이를 통해 경제적 불평등에 대한 논의를 활성화시키고자 한다. 한편 이 책은 부유함이라는 딱딱한 주제를 다루면서도 여러 시대를 아우르는 철학자, 문학가들을 소환하여 부유함을 주제로 이야기를 나누는 것도 충분히 즐거운 경험이 될 수 있음을 우리에게 보여 준다.

코로나19 팬데믹은 정말 많은 것들을 바꿔놓았다. 어떤 개인과 기업들은 어쩌면 21세기에 처음이자 마지막으로 부자가 될 기회를 맞이했을 것이고, 또 어떤 개인과 기업들은 전혀 생각지도 못했던 위기를 맞아야 했다. 이는 국가도 마찬가지다. 

저자인 곽수종 박사는 코로나19 팬데믹으로 인해 국가도 무한경쟁 시대를 맞이하게 됐다고 말한다. 이 변화에 빠르게 대처하지 못한다면 대한민국은 글로벌 경쟁에서 뒤처지게 된다는 것이다. 시대의 역동성을 자연스러운 성장과 발전 과정으로 이해하고 반응하는 법을 익히는 것이 무엇보다 중요하다고 말한다.

이 책은 시대의 변화와 목표를 이해하기 위해 인문학적으로도 접근한다. 미국의 독립전쟁 이후 미국이 주도한 ‘국가와 시민의 변화’, 일본 메이지유신으로 대변되는 ‘개혁적 변화’, 뉴질랜드의 ‘위에서 아래로의 변화’를 살펴본다. 

각국의 시대적 상황과 그에 따른 변화와 개혁의 과정을 살펴보면서 대한민국의 현재 상황을 점검하고 변화의 방향을 가늠할 수 있을 것이다. 글로벌 질서 전환의 시대에 대한민국의 현재 좌표는 물론 기업과 개개인이 나아가야 할 방향을 이해하며 경쟁력을 갖추는 데 이 책이 도움이 될 것이다.

들어가는 말 한국경제의 미래를 말한다

프로그래머는 동작하는 코드를 작성하는 법은 알지만, 그저 동작만 한다는 사실은 알지 못한다. 잘 작성된 코드, 이해하기 쉬운 코드, 요구사항의 균형점에 있는 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법은 대부분 알지 못한다. 이 책에서는 동작하는 코드가 아니라 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법을 설명한다. 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법을 하나씩 익히다 보면 수습생에서 전문가로 변화할 수 있을 것이다.

코드를 작성하는 일관된 스타일을 익히는 것이 중요하다. 코드의 표현 스타일, 변수 이름 짓기, 오류 처리, 보안 같이 코딩에 필요한 요소들을 익혀서 정말 한 사람이 작성한 게 맞느냐는 얘기는 듣지 않게 하자. 전반부가 코드 작성 그 자체에 대한 이야기라면 후반부는 팀, 개발 프로세스, 명세서 작성, 팀 리뷰, 외부의 제약 조건을 다룬다. 훌륭한 코드는 프로그래머 개인의 코드 작성뿐 아니라 팀, 개발 프로세스, 명세서 작성, 팀 리뷰의 과정을 거친다는 사실을 놓치지 않는다.

초보자를 위한 쉬운 책이라는 이유로 어려운 개념을 생략하거나 모호한 용어를 사용해 억지로 외우게 하지 않는다. 자바를 자바답게 이해하기 위해 필요하다면 어려운 개념도 다룬다. 그림과 예제를 사용해 최대한 쉽게 설명하고 있다.

                    <span>The strength of the US dollar in currency markets has drawn the attention of researchers, policymakers, and businesses for decades. This column examines the effects of the dollar on international trade, with a particular focus on exports. A strong dollar dampens trade volumes through the financial channel, outweighing any improvement in trade competitiveness. Trade activity is strong when the dollar is weak, but global trade suffers when the dollar is strong.</span>

                    <span>Employers in the US are grappling with whether and how to bring employees back to the office or other place of work. Using survey-based evidence, this column finds that four in ten Americans who currently work from home at least one day a week would seek another job if employers require a full return to business premises, and most workers would look favourably on a new job that offers the same pay with the option to work from home two or three days a week. High rates of quits and job openings in recent months appear to partly reflect a re-sorting of workers based on the scope for remote working.</span>

                    <span>Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in June was 1.86%, down from 2.01% in May.  Freddie&#x27;s rate is down year-over-year from 2.48% in June 2020.
Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.15%, down from 0.19% in May, and down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.</span>

                    <span>Note: This is as of July 18th.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Slightly Decreases to 3.48%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 2 basis points from 3.50% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 3.48% as of July 18, 2021.  According to MBA’s estimate, 1.74 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 2 basis points to 1.81%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 1 basis point to 4.35%, while the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) increased 5 basis points to 7.38%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers remained the same relative to the  prior week at 3.68%, and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased 1 basis point to 3.61%.
“As is typical for mid-month reporting, forbearance exits slowed, and there was a slight increase in new  requests. The net result was a small drop in the share of loans in forbearance – the 21 st consecutive  week of declines,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “The  forbearance share decreased for GSE and Ginnie Mae loans, but increased for portfolio and PLS loans, as  new forbearance requests increased for this category.”

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of July 23rd, inventory was at 403 thousand (7 day average), compared to 640 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 37.1%.


A week ago, inventory was at 391 thousand, and was down 39.6% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 31.4% above the record low in early April.

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - almost back to the level of a year ago - although still well below a normal rate for July.</span>

코로나바이러스감염증-19(이하 코로나19)로 인류는 서로 접촉하지 않는, 이른바 ‘언택트 시대’로 접어들었다. 불과 2년 전까지만 해도 선택의 영역이었던 인공지능과 IT 기술이 코로나19를 기점으로 일상 전반을 지배하게 된 것이다.

2020년 8월, 미국을 대표하는 30개 기업의 주가지수를 보여주는 다우지수가 석유기업 엑슨모빌을 92년 만에 퇴출하고, 그 자리에 클라우드 기업 세일즈포스를 올린 것은 석유 경제로 대표되던 3차 산업혁명 시대가 저물고 4차 산업혁명의 시대가 도래했음을 알린 상징적 사건이었다. 

《에이트》와 《에이트 : 씽크》의 작가 이지성이 ‘에이트 시리즈’의 완결편이자 실천편인 《미래의 부》로 돌아왔다. 유튜브 채널 ‘이지성TV’를 통해 5천만 뷰 이상의 폭발적인 관심을 받은 ‘4차 산업혁명 미국 주식 특강’을 토대로 완성된 이 책은, 코로나19로 이미 우리 삶 깊숙이 들어온 인공지능 시대에 재편될 부의 흐름을 읽고 ‘미래의 부’를 창출할 새로운 방법을 제시한다.

계명대학교 국제학연구소 학술총서 3권. 국제금융론과 게임이론 분야에서 세계적인 권위자인 하마다 고이치가 일본경제의 부활 가능성을 알리는 책이다. 그는 ‘일은류이론’을 표방하는 일본은행이 경제학 200년에 기반하는 보편적인 법칙으로 운영하면 일본경제가 곧바로 부활할 것이라 확신한다. 세계경제하에서 일본경제의 부활은 일본과 근접한 위치에 있는 우리가 민감하게 알아차려야 할 사항이다.

2017년 10월 유니버시티 칼리지 런던의 세계번영연구소가 발표한 보고서에서 처음 소개한 ‘보편적 기본서비스’를 본격적으로 소개하는 책이다. 기본서비스는 최근 주목받고 있는 기본소득 운동에 대응해 제안됐다. 따라서 기본서비스와 기본소득 사이에는 화해할 수 없는 명확한 차이점이 있다. 

그건 모든 사람이 지불 능력이 아니라 필요에 따라 생활필수품을 얻을 수 있도록 함께 자원을 모아 위험 분담하기를 원하는가, 아니면 모든 사람의 주머니 속에 약간 더 많은 돈을 넣어주고 우리의 미래를 시장에 맡기기를 원하는가?하는 문제이다. 그래서 이 책은 기본소득 논쟁 나아가 복지 논쟁에 불을 붙이기를 원하고 있다. 즉 불평등의 확대, 흔들리는 복지제도, 지속불가능한 소비 등과 같은 긴급한 문제들을 어떻게 해결할지 논쟁해보자는 것이다.

한국어판 서문 	
서론 우리는 무엇을 함께 하고 어떻게 서로를 도울 것인가	

1장 왜 지금 복지 패러다임의 변화가 필요한가	
왜 부자 나라에 가난한 사람이 늘어나는가	
생존하는 데 필요한 것과 원하는 것은 다르다	
누구나 기본적 필요를 충족할 수 있어야 한다	
사회임금의 가치는 화폐로 환산한 가치보다 크다 	

2장 어떻게 보편적 기본서비스를 운영할 것인가
어떻게 운영되는가	
누구에게 책임이 있는가	
누구에게 권한이 있는가	
어떤 조직 모델이 유용한가	
자금 지원은 어떻게 하는가 	
어떻게 참여를 끌어내는가	
어떤 기준으로 운영하는가	
어떤 자격 조건이 필요한가	
공무원은 무엇을 해야 하는가	
보편적 기본서비스만의 주요 특징은 무엇인가	

3장 보편적 기본서비스의 장점은 무엇인가
평등: 소득 불평등을 줄여준다	
효율성: 투입 대비 산출로 보면 안 된다	
효율성: 인간 삶의 번영이 기준이 된다	
연대: 공감과 책임의식이 높아진다		
지속가능성: 지속 역량으로 작동한다	
기본소득과 보편적 기본서비스를 비교해보자	

4장 보편적 기본서비스의 시작: 돌봄 서비스
의료 서비스와 학교 교육에서 교훈을 얻고 배우자	
‘아동 돌봄’은 조기 교육이자 집단 책임으로 해야 한다	
‘성인 사회적 돌봄’은 성숙한 사회라면 반드시 해야 한다	

5장 보편적 기본서비스의 시작: 주거, 교통, ICT
모든 사람에게는 ‘주거’가 필요하다	
모든 사람에게는 ‘교통’ 수단이 필요하다	
ICT는 새로운 시대의 생활 필수 서비스다	
그 누구도 굶는 일은 없어야 한다	

6장 더 나은 보편적 기본서비스를 만들어가자
정부의 권한과 역량이 바뀌어야 한다	
민주적 의사결정 체제를 갖춰야 한다	
대기업의 독점과 폭리를 막아야 한다	
자본주의하에서 보편적 기본서비스는 가능하다	
보편적 기본서비스 비용이 늘어나지만 감당할 수 있다	
기본소득과 보편적 기본서비스 둘 다를 할 수는 없다

결론 궁극의 복지 시스템으로 나아가자	

역자 후기 보편적 복지국가를 향해 가자

더욱 구체적인 사례 중심의 실무서. 추상적인 이론과 실제 M&amp;A 및 LBO 사례를 연결해 실무에 당장 활용할 수 있도록 해준다. 성공적인 M&amp;A, LBO 투자의 실질적 경제성을 수학적·재무적으로 분석하게끔 알려준다. 각종 회계·재무분석의 이론을 알아도, 이를 엑셀 프로그램을 사용해 실제 밸류에이션 모델까지 구축해 분석하기는 어려운 것이 현실인데, 이 책은 구체적인 사례 중심의 설명들로 그 방법을 속 시원히 알려준다. 그 어디에서도 알려주지 않는, 현업 실무자들만이 알고 있는 내용이다. 

사모펀드 조성 및 기업 투자 절차와 부록에 소개한 S&amp;P Capital IQ의 구체적인 사용방법 등, 업계 전반적인 생태에 대한 이해뿐 아니라 실무진 레벨에서 사용하는 유용한 분석 도구 활용 역시 두루 설명하고 있다. 이번 개정판에서는 실제 사례 중심의 추가로 더욱 이해가 쉽도록 도와주고 있다. 광범위하고 다양한 알짜배기 내용을 많이 포함하고 있어 금융계 입성을 꿈꾸는 대학생부터 M&amp;A 업무에 관한 좀 더 전문적인 지식 습득을 원하는 직장인 모두에게 최고의 선택이 될 것이다.

바야흐로 투자의 시대가 도래한 요즘, 좀 더 안정적이고 꾸준한 수익을 얻을 수 있는 금융 상품이 인기다. 저자인 김우석 작가는 《행동재무학자 알 선생이 들려주는 선박금융 이야기》에 행동재무학자로서 그리고 항해학을 전공한 사람으로서 많은 이에게 전하고 싶은 이야기를 담았다. 

이 책은 우리에게 다소 생소한 투자 상품인 ‘선박금융 상품’에 한 걸음 더 다가갈 수 있는 기회를 줄 것이다. 또한, 행동재무학을 바탕으로 하여 우리가 경제적으로 비합리적인 선택을 하는 이유 등 흥미로운 주제를 포함하고 있어 경제 분야에 지식이 없는 사람들에게 친숙하게 다가갈 수 있는 친절한 책이라고 할 수 있다. 금융업에 종사하며 본인이 겪은 지식적인 어려움을 십분 반영하였기에 같은 업계에 종사하는 초보 금융인들에게도 도움이 될 것이다.

해양에 살고 해양에 죽었던 저자의 인생 스토리 또한 많은 이의 눈길을 사로잡을 만하다. 살아남기 위해서 유학길에 오르고 처절하게 공부했던 이야기부터 저자가 추구하는 한국형 선주 사업에 대한 설명, 파이어족이 되어야 하는 이유까지 알찬 내용으로 구성되어 다방면으로 독자의 수요를 만족하는 책이 될 것이다.

국내 3대 신용평가사인 NICE신용평가의 크레딧 전문가들이 모여 펴낸 경제 및 산업 분석서다. 신용평가사의 딱딱한 리포트 형식을 벗어나 경제사와 산업사 속의 재미있는 사건과 일화 중심으로 서술되어 전문 투자자는 물론 일반 독자들도 쉽게 읽을 수 있다. 특히 최근 국제경제환경의 변화, 4차 산업혁명의 의미에 대한 신용평가사의 통찰이 돋보인다.

경제학은 무미건조하다. 이것이 사람들이 경제학을 바라보는 시선이다. 그러나 무미건조한 경제학의 겉모습은 위장에 불과하다. 돈 버는 학문을 넘어서 경제학은 인간에 대한 학문이다. 제한된 자원으로 인간의 무한한 필요와 욕구를 충족시키는 방법을 연구하는 것이 경제학이다. 

이렇듯 어렵고 냉정해보이기만한 경제학을 《하루 3분, 생각의 깊이를 더하는 경제학 100문장》에서는 100개의 유명하고 영감을 줄 수 있는 명언들을 연대기 순으로 정리했다. 경제학의 역사와 함께 주요 개념과 이론에 대해 설명한다. 이를 통해 경제학이 ‘인간의 일상생활을 연구하는 학문’이라는 경제학자 마셜의 말을 다시금 깨달을 수 있을 것이다. 

세상에 존재하는 다양한 경제이론들을 100개의 인용문들로 완벽히 설명할 수는 없을 것이다. 하지만 이 책은 경제학이 무엇인지 전반적인 개요를 설명함으로써 경제학에 대한 편견을 깨는 것에 목적이 있다. 또한 명언들의 의미를 직관적으로 파악할 수 있도록 다양한 이미지들과 그래프들이 함께 소개되고 있다는 것이 이 책의 가장 큰 매력이다. 어렵게만 느껴졌던 경제학에 한 발 가까이 갈 수 있는 좋은 경제학 입문서가 될 것이다.

대만 사상 최연소 장관이자 소프트웨어 프로그래머라는 특이한 이력의 소유자인 오드리 탕은, 2020년 닥친 전대미문의 전지구적 재난 속에서 전 세계 미디어의 주목을 받았다. 많은 나라가 마스크 수급과 방역에 어려움을 겪고 있을 때, 대만은 조기에 마스크 실명 배급제를 실시하고, 수십여 가지의 &#x27;마스크 지도 애플리케이션&#x27;을 개발하여 초기 방역에 성공했다. 

오드리 탕은 입각한 뒤에도 &#x27;디지털 담당 정무위원&#x27;으로서 정부 부처의 온라인 협업을 조율하는 것은 물론, 자신이 직접 만든 숙의민주주의 플랫폼 브이타이완(vTaiwan), 조인(Join) 등을 통해 시민들을 정치에 참여시키고, 모두의 발언에 귀기울이며 시민사회의 집단지성을 공공의 영역에 끌어들이고 있다. 

디지털과 인터넷, 인공지능이 어떻게 더 사회를 진전시키고, 소외된 이들의 문제를 해결하고, 사람들이 자발적으로 어울려 서로를 이해할 수 있게 하는지, 직접 행동으로써 보여주고 있는 것이다. 이 같은 행보는 그의 삶 전체에 걸쳐, 디지털 기술로써 모두의 이익에 이바지하고자 하는 자세로 일관되어 왔다.

분배 결과의 공정성만을 해소하기 위한 싸움에서 이길 수 있는 정부는 없다. 기회의 공정성을 훼손하고 있는 교육, 지역균형발전 등에 관한 시책이 선행되거나 최소한 동시적으로 진행되어야 정책효과를 극대화시킬 수 있다.

튼실한 사회안전망을 갖춘 성장잠재력이 높은 경제구조를 우리 후손에게 물려주어야 할 막중한 책무가 우리에게 주어져 있다. 국민이 먼저 변해야 한다. 그러면 정치의 모습도 당연히 변하게 된다.

지구가 몸살을 앓고 있다. 빙하의 해빙뿐 아니라 폭염과 폭설, 산불, 허리케인 등 이상기후 현상이 세계 곳곳에서 일어나고 있다. 이 모든 것이 지구온난화로 인해 벌어진 현상이다. 지구온난화의 주범으로 지목되는 온실가스, 이를 해결하기 위해 세계는 ‘탄소제로’를 선언했다. 지금까지 사용해오던 화석연료에서 벗어나 그린 에너지로의 전환에 모든 기업이 주목하고 있다. 이러한 ‘그린 혁명’의 흐름에 우리 기업들은 어떻게 준비하고 있을까? 

이 책은 수소경제를 비롯해 재생에너지, 에코 모빌리티 등 탈탄소 시대에 우리가 주목해야 할 미래 산업을 소개한다. 이와 함께 세계 경제가 친환경 에너지 산업으로 빠르게 이동하는 과정과 현대자동차, 한국전력, SK이노베이션, 현대중공업, 롯데케미칼, 두산퓨얼셀, SK가스, 고려아연 등 한국 대표 기업들이 이러한 변화에 어떻게 대응하고 있는지 짚어본다.

역사와 현실을 종횡무진하며 다양한 규제의 세목과 그 이면들을 살핀다. 수백 년 역사를 넘나들며, 미국, 영국, 프랑스부터 루마니아, 리비아, 베네수엘라, 그리고 대한민국까지 세계 각지의 엉뚱하고 황당한 규제 정책들을 다룬다. ‘하룻밤에 읽는 규제의 역사’라 할 정도로 사례들 하나하나가 흥미진진하다.

가상화폐, 코인 시장이 무섭게 흔들리고 있다. 2020년 하반기부터 시작된 맹렬한 상승세에, 2021년 4월에 7만 달러를 넘보던 비트코인이 6월 들어 3만 달러 밑으로까지 떨어지며 요동쳤다. 중국이 채굴장을 폐쇄하고 각국 정부가 규제책을 내놓으면서 ‘코인 시장은 끝났다’는 자조도 나온다. 그런가 하면 돈나무 언니로 불리는 캐시 우드(아크 인베스트먼트 CEO)를 위시로 한 투자자들은 ‘비트코인 50만 달러 간다’면서 ‘떨어질 때가 오히려 사야 할 적기’라고 호언한다. 평범한 투자자로선 불안하기 짝이 없다. 

지금 코인에 투자해도 되는지, 어떤 코인에 투자해야 하는지 혼란스럽다. 수백 배씩 오르며 ‘돈 복사기’로 불렸던 알트코인조차 거래소가 연이어 상장폐지하면서 폭락한다. 상승과 하락 폭이 너무도 커서 시장에 대응하는 게 위태롭고 초조하다. 

그러나 변덕스런 도박판으로 치부하기에는 가상자산 시장은 이미 너무 커져 버렸다. 각국이 중앙은행 디지털 화폐(CBDC)를 속속 도입하고, 코인 비즈니스 모델은 모든 첨단 산업(메타버스, 게임, 플랫폼)과 연결되기에 미래가치가 무궁무진하다. 무작정 무시하기엔 가능성이 너무 큰 시장이다. 3년 전 1차 코인붐이 꺼질 때 코인 시장이 망할 거라 비웃던 이들은 어떻게 되었나? 2020년 눈앞에 펼쳐진 2차 …</span>

지난 30여 년간 6번의 정권이 바뀌는 동안, 그 어떤 정부도 말하지 않은 ‘한국 경제 불변의 법칙’이 있다. 경제의 진짜 성장능력을 나타내는 장기성장률이 1990년대 초 이후 매 5년마다 1%포인트씩 미끄럼틀 타듯이 지속적으로 추락해온 ‘한국 경제 5년 1% 하락의 법칙’이 그것이다. 

이 암울한 법칙은 매우 강력하여 보수, 진보 정권에 상관없이 그 위력을 발휘해왔을 뿐만 아니라, 2003년 사스, 2015년 메르스 등 전염병 사태가 발발하고 1997년 외환위기, 2008년 글로벌 금융위기 등 경제위기가 있었지만 이 위기들 이전과 이후 상관없이 한국 경제를 주도해왔다. 

그럼에도 어떤 정부도 지속적 경제 하락 추세를 국민들에게 알리지 않았고, 표를 얻기 위해 ‘신기루 경제정책’을 펼치고도 정권을 잡았다. 그런 다음 임기 동안 단기적 성장률을 높이는 데만 집중하며 경기부양정책을 펼쳐왔다. 고통스러운 제로성장의 도래를 그 다음 정부로 떠넘기고자 ‘폭탄 돌리기’를 지속해온 것이다.

저자인 서울대학교 경제학부 김세직 교수는 첫 단독저서 『모방과 창조』를 통해 한국 경제에 이 퇴행의 법칙이 계속 작동하면 향후 장기성장률이 0%대의 제로성장에 처해 디스토피아적 상황을 맞이하게 됨을 강력히 경고한다. 소득의 극심한 감소를 피하기 위해서는, 하루 빨리 추락의 원인을…</span>

우리는 부동산 문제 해결이 그저 ‘정책’으로는 되지 않는다는 사실을 깨달아야 한다. 오늘날 한국 사회는 부동산으로 이득을 보는 걸 당연시하며, 그런 관점 아래 법제도와 사회구조 및 관습 등이 구성돼 있다. 한마디로 이것은 ‘체제’의 문제인 것이다. 그리하여 한국은 ‘불로소득 유발형 부동산체제’가 굳게 자리잡고 말았다. 

당연히 한두 가지 정책 도입만으로 이런 체제는 꿈쩍도 하지 않는다. 분명한 철학과 확고한 원칙, 그리고 체계적이고 종합적인 정책 패키지가 결합된 토탈 솔루션이 필요하다. 이 책 『불로소득 환수형 부동산체제론』은 체제의 관점에서 부동산 문제에 접근한 최초의 시도로, 부동산체제의 코페르니쿠스적 전환을 제안하고 있다.

&#x27;중국 특색의 사회주의&#x27;가 신시대에 접어들면서 아름다운 생활을 갈망하는 인민들의 요구는 날고 강렬해졌고, 날로 광범해졌다. 동시에 발전 불균형과 불충분으로 나타난 문제들을 해결하지 못했기에 발전 품질과 효익이 높지 못했다. 민생영역에는 아직도 많은 단점들이 있다. 사회문명은 향상되어야 하고 사회모순과 문제도 중첩되어 있다. 이 책은 시진핑 신시대 &#x27;중국 특색의 사회주의&#x27; 사상 연구를 담았다.

제1장 경제체제 개혁을 끝까지 진행하자
 1. 경제체제 개혁은 중국의 모습을 변화시켰다
  (1) 개혁은 중국경제 총량이 부단히 새로운 단계에 오르도록 했다
  (2) 개혁은 인민들의 생활을 최저생활 수준에서 전면적인 샤오캉사회로 발전시켰다
  (3) 개혁은 중국의 국제경쟁력을 현저하게 향상시켰다
  (4) 중요 영역과 관건적인 부분에서의 개혁은 돌파적인 진척을 가져왔다
 2. 개혁은 이미 관건적인 단계에 진입했다
  (1) 중국의 경제성장은 여전히 체제적 요소의 영향을 크게 받고 있다
  (2) 점진적 개혁에서 전면적 개혁의 심화로
  (3) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 일부 사람들의 이익을 건드릴 수 있다
 3. 반드시 실속 있게 개혁을 추진해야 한다
  (1) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 혁명과도 같은 것이기에 반드시 실속 있게 진행해야 한다
  (2) 개혁을 돌파할 수 있는 관건은 실시하는 데에 있다
  (3) 개혁을 하려는 자를 등용하고, 개혁을 하려하지 않는 자를 해임하는 인재등용의 방식을 지향해야 한다
 4. 오직 개혁개방 만이 중국을 발전시키고, 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다
  (1) 개혁개방은 백년 목표의 실현을 결정하는 관건이다
  (2) 경제체제 개혁은 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 중점이다
  (3) 발전을 포용하고 지속시키려면 개혁을 심화시키는 것에 의존해야 한다
  (4) 오직 개혁개방만이 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다

제2장 경제체제 개혁의 총체적 요구와 기본방향
 1. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키기 위한 총체적 요구
 2. 사회주의 공평 정의와 인민복지의 증진은 개혁의 출발점이고 목표점이다
 3. 사회주의 기본 경제제도를 견지하고 개선해야 한다
 4. 사회주의 시장경제의 개혁방향을 견지해야 한다
 5. 체제개혁의 목적과 조건
 6. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 노선도

제3장 정확하게 전면적으로 경제체제의 개혁을 심화시키기 위해서는 약간의 중대한 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 1. 사상해방과 실사구시의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 2. 신중하게 일을 처리하는 것과 상부 설계와의 관계를 잘 처리 해야 한다
 3. 증량을 추진하는 국부적인 개혁과 전면적으로 추진하는 전반적인 개혁과의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 4. 개혁ㆍ발전ㆍ안...

『C++로 나만의 운영체제 만들기』의 후속편으로, 저자가 직접 제작한 YUZA OS라는 OS를 파헤쳐 보면서 운영체제의 구조와 원리를 설명한다. 리눅스 같은 기존의 운영체제 개발환경에서 벗어나 윈도우 운영체제에서 OS를 개발하며 비주얼 스튜디오 2019와 C++로 운영체제 개발 방법을 설명하는 것이 특징이다. 아울러 저자가 게임 개발자 출신답게 다양한 게임을 자신만의 OS에서 쉽게 제작할 수 있는 방법을 설명하는 것에 심혈을 기울였다.
