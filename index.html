                    <span>Treatment intensity varies remarkably across physicians, yet the key drivers are not well understood. Meanwhile, the organization of healthcare is undergoing a secular transformation as physicians increasingly work in groups. This paper tests whether physicians&#x27; group affiliation matters for practice styles and patient health. Using Medicare inpatient claims data, we compare these outcomes before and after physicians switch between groups of varying treatment intensity while remaining in the same hospital to control for practice setting. Event studies show that internists who join more-intensive groups immediately increase their own treatment intensity, with an elasticity of approximately 0.3; the opposite is found for internists who switch to groups that are less intensive. This change in Medicare spending largely stems from greater quantities of care provided, with some evidence of a change in coding behavior.  We do not detect a change in health outcomes, suggesting that treatment intensity induced by group affiliation may not be productive.</span>

                    <span>This paper documents novel evidence on the influence of political incentives in the regulatory enforcement of foreign bribery. Using exogenous variation in the timing and geographic location of U.S. Congressional elections, we find that the probability of a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement action against foreign firms located in the Senator’s jurisdiction increases significantly pre-election, spiking 23%, with zero equivalent move for equivalently global (but domestic-headquartered) firms in the Senator’s jurisdiction. Using hand-collected case-level data from the U.S. SEC and DOJ, we also observe larger discretion in regions where foreign firms are larger global competitors of in-state firms, operate in locally important industries, and when Senators serve as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee (which oversees the DOJ). Anti-bribery enforcement has electoral implications, leading to spikes in media coverage of the FCPA enforcement coupled with greater vote shares for the Senator. Moreover, the cases pushed through against these foreign firms just prior to elections appear to be weaker cases. The enforcements result in real effects, as in response to strategic timing in enforcement, firms reallocate business segments and sales.</span>

                    <span>We provide the first evidence that spatial variation in all-cause mortality risk is capitalized into US housing prices. Using a hedonic framework, we recover the annual implicit cost of a 0.1 percentage-point reduction in mortality risk among older Americans and find that this figure is both relatively low and decreasing in age, from $1,346 for a 67 year old to $246 for an 87 year old. These estimates are one-fifth of the size of comparable estimates found in the labor market, suggesting that the housing market provides an alternative, substantially cheaper channel to reducing mortality risk.</span>

                    <span>In the mid-19th century, the urban milk supply in the United States was regularly skimmed or diluted with water, reducing its nutritional value. At the urging of public health experts, cities across the country hired milk inspectors, who were tasked with collecting and analyzing milk samples with the goal of preventing adulteration and skimming. Using city-level data for the period 1880-1910, we explore the effects of milk inspections on infant mortality and mortality among children under the age of 5. Event-study estimates are small and statistically insignificant, providing little evidence of post-treatment reductions in either infant or child mortality.</span>

                    <span>We consider a version of the imperfect competition model of Butters (1977), Varian (1980) and Burdett and Judd (1983) in which sellers make an ex-ante investment in the quality of their variety of the product. Equilibrium exists, is unique and is efficient. In equilibrium, search frictions not only cause sellers to offer different surpluses to buyers but also cause sellers to choose different qualities for their varieties. That is, equilibrium involves endogenous vertical differentiation. As search frictions decline, the market becomes more and more unequal as a smaller and smaller fraction of sellers produces varieties of increasing quality, offers increasing surplus to their customers, and captures an increasing share of the market, while a growing fraction of sellers produces varieties of decreasing quality. Gains from trade and welfare grow. Under some conditions, the growth rate of gains from trade and welfare is constant.</span>

                    <span>Workers wrongly anchor their beliefs about outside options on their current wage. In particular, low-paid workers underestimate wages elsewhere. We document this anchoring bias by eliciting workers’ beliefs in a representative survey in Germany and comparing them to measures of actual outside options in linked administrative labor market data. In an equilibrium model, such anchoring can give rise to monopsony and labor market segmentation. In line with the model, misperceptions are particularly pronounced among workers in low-wage firms. If workers had correct beliefs, at least 10% of jobs, concentrated in low-wage firms, would not be viable at current wages.</span>

                    <span>We show that “preemptive” capital flow management measures (CFM) can reduce emerging markets and developing countries’ (EMDE) external finance premia during risk-off shocks, especially for vulnerable countries. Using a panel dataset of 56 EMDEs during 1996–2020 at monthly frequency, we document that countries with preemptive policies in place during the five year window before risk-off shocks experienced relatively lower external finance premia and exchange rate volatility during the shock compared to countries which did not have such pre-emptive policies in place. We use the episodes of Taper Tantrum and COVID-19 as risk-off shocks. Our identification relies on a difference-in-differences methodology with country fixed effects where preemptive policies are ex-ante by construction and cannot be put in place as a response to the shock ex-post. We control the effects of other policies, such as monetary policy, foreign exchange interventions (FXI), easing of inflow CFMs and tightening of outflow CFMs that are used in response to the risk-off shocks. By reducing the impact of risk-off shocks on countries’ funding costs and exchange rate volatility, preemptive policies enable countries’ continued access to international capital markets during troubled times.</span>

                    <span>Despite escalating disaster losses and predicted increases in weather-related catastrophes, takeup of protective technologies and behaviors appears limited by myopia, externalities, and other factors. One response to such frictions is to mandate adaptive investment. We measure the effect of California&#x27;s wildfire building codes on own- and neighboring structure survival using administrative damage and assessment data for most US homes experiencing wildfires since 2000. Differences across jurisdictions and vintages reveal remarkable resilience effects of building codes initially prompted by the deadly 1991 Oakland Firestorm. Codes also benefit neighbors. We use the results to estimate net social benefits of wildfire building standards.</span>

                    <span>Advanced economies feature complicated networks that connect households, ﬁrms, and regions. How do these structures aﬀect the impact of ﬁscal policy and its optimal targeting? We study these questions in a model with input-output linkages, regional structure, and household heterogeneity in MPCs, consumption baskets, and shock exposures. Theoretically, we derive estimable formulae for the eﬀects of ﬁscal policies on aggregate GDP, or ﬁscal multipliers, and show how network structures determine their size. Empirically, we ﬁnd that multipliers vary substantially across policies, so targeting is important. Beneath these aggregate eﬀects are large spatial and sectoral spillovers from policies directed to any one ﬁrm or household. However, virtually all variation in multipliers stems from diﬀerences in policies’ direct incidence onto households’ MPCs. Thus, while the distributional eﬀects of ﬁscal policy depend on the detailed structure of the economy, maximally expansionary ﬁscal policy simply targets households’ MPCs.</span>

                    <span>This paper focuses on the price of nails since 1695 and the proximate source of changes in those prices. Why nails? They are a basic manufactured product whose form and quality have changed relatively little over the last three centuries, yet the process for producing them has changed dramatically. Accordingly, nails provide a useful prism through which to examine a wide range of economic and technological developments that touch on multiple areas of both micro- and macroeconomics. Several conclusions emerge. First, from the late 1700s to the mid 20th century real nail prices fell by a factor of about 10 relative to overall consumer prices. These declines had important effects on downstream industries, most notably construction. Second, while declining materials prices contribute to reductions in nail prices, the largest proximate source of the decline during this period was multifactor productivity growth in nail manufacturing, highlighting the role of the specialization of labor and re-organization of production processes. Third, the share of nails in GDP dropped back from 0.4 percent of GDP in 1810—comparable to today’s share of household purchases of personal computers—to a de minimis share more recently; accordingly, nails played a bigger role in American life in that earlier period. Finally, real nail prices have increased since the mid 20th century, reflecting in part an upturn in materials prices and a shift toward specialty nails in the wake of import competition, though the introduction of nail guns partly offset these increases for the price of installed nails.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we empirically assess the causal links between trade and individual income risk and study the role that human capital plays in this relationship using a rich, worker-level, longitudinal data set from Germany spanning 1976 to 2012. Our estimates suggest substantial heterogeneity in labor income risk across workers in different entry cohorts and across workers with different levels of industry- and occupation-specific human capital. Our findings suggest that within-industry changes in imports and exports are causally related to income risk: Imports increase risk and exports decrease risk, and they do so in an economically significant manner. Importantly, we find there to be a complex interplay between human capital and the linkage between trade and risk: While, on average, individuals with higher levels of industry- or occupation-specific human capital experience lower income risk, a given increase in net-imports exposure in an industry increases risk for workers with higher levels of industry tenure more than it does for workers with lower levels of industry tenure. High levels of industry-specific human capital can be costly for workers in highly trade-exposed industries. By contrast, we find no evidence of any interaction between risk, industry trade exposure, and occupation-specific human capital.</span>

                    <span>Blackouts impose substantial economic costs in developing countries. This paper advances a new explanation for their continued prevalence: unlike in high-income countries, where regulatory mandates require utilities to satisfy all electricity demand, utilities in developing countries respond to wholesale electricity prices. As a result, misallocation of output across power plants can decrease the quantity of electricity supplied to end-users. We provide empirical support for this explanation using novel data from India, home to the world’s third-largest electricity sector. In contrast to the developed world, we find that Indian wholesale demand is downward-sloping. Reducing supply-side misallocation would increase electricity supply for the average household by 1.7 percent (enough to power 4.6 million additional households). Justifying a mandate that utilities must satisfy all end-use demand would require consumers to value electricity far above the cost of diesel backup generation. However, such a mandate would likely be cost-effective if paired with supply-side reforms.</span>

                    <span>We examine the impacts of physician-hospital integration on care fragmentation and other measures of care-coordination using a dynamic model of movers and stayers in commercially insured plans. Although recent growth in the share of practicing physicians belonging to these vertical organizations has sparked considerable policy debate, there is a paucity of evidence on the merits of vertical integration in the private segment of the market. We fill the gap by focusing on care-coordination in the relatively open plans that dominate commercial insurance, namely Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). We exploit the fact that physician-hospital integration levels vary dramatically across MSA and focus on orthogonal employment-based transfers for identification. We track 415,000 beneficiaries with 17 million claims between 2010 and 2016. We find that standard two-way fixed effect mover-stayer models produce biased estimates since there are heterogeneous effects of integration. Extending the dynamic event study design of Sun and Abraham (2021) to mover-stayer analyses, we are able to avoid these biases. We find that a move from the 10th to 90th percentile of physician integration level causes a 20% relative decrease in a care fragmentation index; similar declines are found in independent markers of fragmentation such as use of out-of-network and single-service facilities. Vertical integration of either primary care physicians or specialists reduced fragmentation significantly. However, only vertical integration of specialists led to significant reductions in medical spending. Our results are robust when adjusting for moves associated with alternative contractual arrangements among providers that do not require outright ownership.</span>

                    <span>One-fifth of U.S. high school students report being bullied each year. We use internet search data for real-time tracking of bullying patterns as COVID-19 disrupted in-person schooling. We first show that, prepandemic, internet searches contain useful information about actual bullying behavior. We then show that searches for school bullying and cyberbullying dropped 30-35 percent as schools shifted to remote learning in spring 2020. The gradual return to in-person instruction starting in fall 2020 partially returns bullying searches to pre-pandemic levels. This rare positive effect may partly explain recent mixed evidence on the pandemic’s impact on students’ mental health and well-being.</span>

                    <span>This paper explores methods for inferring the causal effects of treatments on choices by combining data on real choices with hypothetical evaluations. We propose a class of estimators, identify conditions under which they yield consistent estimates, and derive their asymptotic distributions. The approach is applicable in settings where standard methods cannot be used (e.g., due to the absence of helpful instruments, or because the treatment has not been implemented). It can recover heterogeneous treatment effects more comprehensively, and can improve precision. We provide proof of concept using data generated in a laboratory experiment and through a field application.</span>

                    <span>The credit sensitivity of LIBOR helped lenders during the financial crisis. SOFR is not credit-sensitive and would not have provided that support. The cumulative additional interest from LIBOR during the crisis is estimated to be between 1% to 2% of the notional amount of outstanding loans, depending on the tenor and type of SOFR rate used. The amount of LIBOR business loans owned by banks could have been as high as about 2trn, and the overall additional interest income banks received thanks to LIBOR could have been as high as 30bn dollars. The analysis also shows that a compounded SOFR reduces insurance relative to a term SOFR.</span>

6) Monetary Policy:  In response to the pandemic, the FOMC cut rates to zero, and initiated an asset purchase program in March 2020.  The FOMC is currently on pace to stop the asset purchase program in March 2022.  A majority of FOMC participants expect three rate hikes in 2022.  Will the Fed raise rates in 2022?  If so, how many times?

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at MortgageNewsDaily: Highest Rates in a Month, But Just Barely
Mortgage rates began the week in decent shape, but moved higher somewhat abruptly yesterday.  Context is important though.  The smallest increment of adjustment for mortgages is typically 0.125%, and we haven&#x27;t seen a move that big since early November.  In fact, the overall range in 30yr fixed rates hasn&#x27;t even been 0.125% during that time!
In other words, we&#x27;re only able to say &quot;highest rates in a month&quot; because they finally trickled to just slightly higher levels.  On that note, we might as well prepare for the next technicality.  Specifically, if things get just a bit worse, we&#x27;ll soon be able to say &quot;highest rates in 9 months,&quot; even though they won&#x27;t be too terribly different from today&#x27;s.
 Click on graph for larger image.
This is a graph from Mortgage News Daily (MND) showing 30-year fixed rates from three sources (MND, MBA, Freddie Mac) since 2010.  

The 30-year fixed rate for top tier scenarios was 3.27% yesterday, up from 3.26% on Wednesday.  This is still historically very low.


If rates rise to 3.30% that will be highest since March 2021.  And 3.46% would be the highest since rates spiked briefly at the beginning of the pandemic.


Go to MND and you can adjust the graph for different time periods.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Question #7 for 2022: How much will Residential investment change in 2022? How about housing starts and new home sales in 2022?
A brief excerpt: 
Earlier I posted some questions on my blog for next year: Ten Economic Questions for 2022.   Some of these questions concern real estate (inventory, house prices, housing credit, housing starts, new home sales), and I’ll post those in the newsletter (others like GDP and employment will be on my blog).
I&#x27;m adding some thoughts, and maybe some predictions for each question. 
...
Most analysts are looking for new home sales to increase in 2022. For example, the NAHB expects new home sales to increase to 840 thousand in 2022, and Fannie Mae expects 897 thousand, and the MBA is forecasting 922 thousand in 2022.
And for housing starts, Fannie Mae is forecasting starts will be mostly unchanged at 1.6 million, and the NAHB is forecasting a decline to 1.55 million.
My guess is starts will be down low-to-mid single digits year-over-year in 2022.  New home sales could pick up solidly if existing home inventory stays low, supply issues are resolved, and mortgage rates stay low, but my guess is new home sales will be mostly unchanged year-over-year.

                    <span>From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Below is a table showing quarterly home sales based on CoreLogic’s property records database for “non-investors” and for “investors” based on size of investors. For fun I also included the YOY % change in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index., As a reminder, here is how CoreLogic defines an investor purchase:
Using CoreLogic’s public records data, we define an investor as an entity (individual or corporate) who retained three or more properties simultaneously within the past 10 years or has a corporate or non-individual identifier on the deed. Examples include LLCs, CORPs, and INCs, to name a few.”
CoreLogic’s “size” categories fir investors are as follows:  small 3-10 properties, mid-sized 11-99 properties, and large 100+ properties.
Click on table for larger image.
What is striking is that investor home purchases by investors in all three size categories exploded upward beginning in the second quarter.
Note that while total home purchases in the third quarter of this year were up 7.5% from the third quarter of 2019, non-investor home purchases were DOWN 5.2%.
I’ll have even more on this topic later.  WRT the above chart, however, here are some questions to consider:
Did investor purchases surge BECAUSE home prices were accelerating? Or was the surge in investor purchases behind the surge in home prices?  Or … was it a combination of both?</span>

파이썬 입문자와 파이썬 프로그래밍에 대한 개념 정립이 필요한 독자를 대상으로 한다. 예제를 실습하면서 자연스럽게 실력이 향상되도록 기초부터 활용까지 꼼꼼하게 다뤘다. Part 1에서는 파이썬 문법을 다루고 있다. 문법 설명은 자칫 지루할 수 있어 자주 사용하지 않는 것들은 제외하고 꼭 필요한 핵심적인 것들 위주로 설명하였다. 코드를 직관적으로 이해할 수 있도록 코드, 코드에 대한 설명, 실행 결과를 한눈에 볼 수 있도록 편집하였다.

파이썬 문법을 익힌 후 Part 2에서는 파이썬으로 할 수 있는 다양한 프로그래밍 구현 방법을 소개한다. wxPython 모듈을 이용한 GUI 프로그래밍, MySQL과 파이썬을 연동한 데이터베이스 프로그래밍, 네트워크 프로그래밍, 데이터베이스와 연동한 웹 프로그래밍 등을 경험할 수 있다.

                    <span>Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family Serious Delinquency decreased to 1.46% in November, from 1.33% in October. The serious delinquency rate is down from 2.96% in November 2020.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.

By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 3.61% are seriously delinquent (down from 4.02% in October). 

For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 6.05% are seriously delinquent (down from 6.90%), 


 For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.08% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.17%). So, Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once they are employed.

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Question #8 for 2022: Housing Credit: Will we see easier mortgage lending in 2022? 
A brief excerpt: 
Earlier I posted some questions on my blog for next year: Ten Economic Questions for 2022.   Some of these questions concern real estate (inventory, house prices, housing credit, housing starts, new home sales), and I’ll post those in the newsletter (others like GDP and employment will be on my blog).
I&#x27;m adding some thoughts, and maybe some predictions for each question. 
...
For Q3 2021, the Net Equity Extraction was $147 billion, or 3.24% of Disposable Personal Income (DPI).   The last two quarters have shown a sharp increase in equity extraction compared to recent years, but the level is nothing like the amount of equity extraction during the housing bubble as a percent of DPI. During the housing bubble we saw several quarters with MEW above 8% of DPI.
...
Mortgage equity withdrawal will probably decline in 2022, since fewer homeowners will refinance their mortgages.   However, there is some concern about banks easing lending standards, and the rapid increase in non-QM loans.
This will be something to watch in 2022, but overall lending is still solid (unlike during the housing bubble).

If inventory doesn’t increase in 2022, house prices will continue to increase at a double-digit pace.   There are several possible reasons for an increase in inventory in 2022.  Here are a few:
1. A sharp increase in mortgage rates.
2. Economic problems overseas that spillover into the US.
3. Unregulated areas of finance causing economic problems.
4.Affordability (a combination of higher mortgage rates and higher prices).
A sharp increase in mortgage rates is possible, especially if inflation stays elevated and the pandemic subsides (each wave of the pandemic has pushed down interest rates).   And at some point, affordability will start to matter, but in general - with low mortgage rates - houses are still somewhat affordable (see the bottom of this post on affordability).

코로나 이후 우리가 일하는 모습을 상상해보자. 마이크로소프트사의 홀로렌즈를 머리에 장착하고 현실 세계에 가상 세계를 융합한 혼합 현실에서 원격회의를 진행한다. 구글 줌을 통해 캘리포니아에 사는 존과 화상 회의를 진행한다. AI가 실시간 통역을 해줘 의사소통에 전혀 불편을 느끼지 못한다.  크라우드 스트라이크사의 완벽한 클라우드 보안으로 개인 컴퓨터를 사용해도 해킹의 염려가 없다.

사무실에 출근하는 날은 아마존의 로보택시를 이용한다. 아마존은 2020년에 자율주행 기술을 연구하는 벤처 기업 Zoox를 인수한 후 이 사업을 추진해왔다. 로보택시 안에 설치된 모니터에서는 아마존이 고객으로부터 얻은 빅데이터를 바탕으로 맞춤형 광고 영상이 나온다. 출장을 가게 될 때는 애플호텔에 묵는다. 호텔 방의 터치 패널에 아이폰을 갖다 대면, 환기 조절, 조명, 음향 등이 자신이 원하는 환경으로 바뀐다. 비용은 추가 할인을 받을 수 있는 애플카드로 결제한다. 점심으로 콩고기로 된 스테이크를 먹고, 쉬는 시간에는 넷플릭스에서 내 취향에 맞게 결말이 바뀐 영화를 본다.

〈이코노미스트〉가 꼽은 2022년 새해 경제 주요 이슈들이다. 이에 대한 전망과 향방을 내다본 『2022 경제 대예측』을 펴냈다. 〈이코노미스트〉는 중앙일보·JTBC 등으로 이뤄진 중앙그룹이 발행하는 프리미엄 경제 전문 뉴스로 1984년 창간해 한국의 경제 발전 역사와 함께 걸어왔다. 최근에는 경제 매거진에 이어 온라인 데일리 경제 뉴스도 제작해 매일 매일 독자들에게 경제 소식을 전하고 있다. 

〈이코노미스트〉가 제작하는 『경제 대예측』은 2008년 출판 등록해 지금까지 해마다 발행하고 있는 대내외 경제 전망서다. 지난해 경제 상황을 돌아보고 새해 경제 쟁점을 전망하는 책이다. 경제 현장에서 뛰고 있는 경제 전문 기자들이 낱낱이 해부한 분석력과, 관련 업계의 정책·통계·동향 등을 통해 현상을 꿰뚫는 경제기관 전문가들의 통찰력으로 대내외 경제 이정표를 제시하는 전망서다. 

이들의 시각을 통해 Yes와 No의 답변과 확률로 가능성을 제시하고 있다. 2021년초에 펴낸 『2021 경제 대예측』은 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)의 전세계 대유행으로 셧다운(정지) 된 세계경제에 대해 2021년에는 ‘V자형 반등’으로 회복할 것으로 전망했으며 이 예측은 적중했다.

2020년 3월 1일, 안드로이드 스튜디오의 버전 번호 시스템이 인텔리제이 IDEA와 일치하도록 연도 표기로 변경되었다. 또한 각 버전 이름도 A~Z로 시작하는 동물의 이름으로 변경되어 기존의 &#x27;안드로이드 스튜디오 4.3&#x27; 버전이 &#x27;안드로이드 스튜디오 Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1&#x27;로 바뀌었다. 이러한 변화에 맞춰 개정 3판을 펴냈다.

3판에서는 Arctic Fox 추가 기능을 모두 반영했으며, Bumblebee와 Chipmunk 베타 버전에서도 실습할 수 있다. 그리고 안드로이드에서 더는 사용하지 않는 구형 코틀린 코드를 수정했다. 또한 파이어베이스 실습 프로젝트(클라우드 메시징(FCM) 등)를 추가했다. 최신 버전으로 실습 환경을 제공한다.

                    <span>Today, in the CalculatedRisk Real Estate Newsletter: Real House Prices, Price-to-Rent Ratio and Price-to-Median Income in October
Excerpt: 
I’ve put together my own affordability index - since 1976 - that is similar to the FirstAm approach (more of a house price index adjusted by mortgage rates and the median household income).
I used median income from the Census Bureau (estimated 2021), assumed a 15% down payment, and used a 2% estimate for property taxes, insurance and maintenance. This is probably low for high property tax states like New Jersey and Texas, and too high for lower property tax states. If we were including condos, we’d also include HOA fees too (this is excluded).
For house prices, I used the Case-Shiller National Index, Seasonally Adjusted (SA). Also, for the down payment - there wasn’t a significant difference between 15% and 20%. For mortgage rates, I used the Freddie Mac PMMS (30-year fixed rates).

So here is what the index looks like (lower is more affordable like the FirstAm index)
...
In general, this would suggest houses are somewhat affordable right now (due to low mortgage rates). But this says nothing about if “now is a good time to buy” (see the bottom of my post Housing: A Look at &quot;Affordability&quot; Indexes).
Also, in October, the average 30-year mortgage rates were around 3.1%, and currently mortgage rates are close to 3.27% - so we already know the “Affordability Price Index” will increase over the next couple of months (meaning houses are less affordable).

                    <span>From the NAR: Pending Home Sales Subside 2.2% in November
Pending home sales slipped in November, receding slightly after a previous month of gains, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Each of the four major U.S. regions witnessed contract transactions decline month-over-month. Year-over-year activity mostly retreated too, as three regions reported drops and only the Midwest saw an increase.
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, fell 2.2.% to 122.4 in November. Year-over-year, signings slid 2.7%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI declined 0.1% to 99.4 in November, an 8.5% drop from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index fell 6.3% to 116.8 last month, up 0.2% from November 2020.
Pending home sales transactions in the South ticked down 0.7% to an index of 148.2 in November, down 1.3% from November 2020. The index in the West slipped 2.2% in November to 105.5, down 4.6% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was well below expectations of a 0.6% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in December and January.</span>

경제학이 담지 못한 ‘행복’의 본질을 찾아서, 진정한 행복은 자신의 잠재력을 실현하는 것이다. 현대 한국인의 행복에는 크게 두 가지 문제가 있다. 평균 행복도가 낮은 것과 연령대가 높아질수록 행복도가 하락하는 것. 저자는 인간의 행복은 자신이 사는 사회체제와 무관하지 않다는 생각을 바탕으로 이러한 저행복의 원인을 시장경제 체제에서 찾는다. 교육, 직장 등 삶의 주요한 영역에서 이루어지는 경쟁이 협력과 공감의 감정을 사라지게 했고, 가까운 사람들마저 경쟁자로 여기면서 행복에 중요한 영향을 주는 관계재가 줄어들었다는 것이다.

저자는 그동안 경제학에서 제시한 다양한 행복의 정의를 비판적으로 검토하면서 경제학이 담지 못한 행복의 본질은 무엇인가 질문을 던진다. 경제학자들의 주장대로 실질소득이 증가하여 소비가 크게 확대되었지만 행복은 상승하지 않았다. 오히려 점점 심화되는 불평등과 차별이 행복을 낮추고 있다. 이에 저자는 기존 경제학의 틀을 넘어서는 새로운 시각으로 행복을 정의한다.

 “진정한 행복은 자신의 잠재력을 실현하는 것”이라는 저자의 행복 정의는 경제학의 각종 지표들이 담지 못한 실제 우리 삶의 이야기면서, 시장경제 체제의 산물도 아니며, 소확행보다 더 넓은 시선으로 인생 전체를 그릴 수 있게 한다. 즉 행복을 내적인 감정이 아닌 현실을 바라보는 시각으로서 제시한 것이다. 이때 자기실현은 홀로 깨달음을 통해 얻는 것이 아니라 사회 속에서 성취하는 것이다. 사회구성원으로서 각자가 자기실현을 위해 노력하고, 서로 협력할수록 행복은 커진다.

                    <span>A few key points:
1) There is a clear seasonal pattern for house prices.
2) The surge in distressed sales during the housing bust distorted the seasonal pattern.
3) Even though distressed sales are down significantly, the seasonal factor is based on several years of data - and the factor is now closer to normal (second graph below).
4) Still the seasonal index is probably a better indicator of actual price movements than the Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) index.
For in depth description of these issues, see Jed Kolko&#x27;s article from 2014 (currently Chief Economist at Indeed) &quot;Let’s Improve, Not Ignore, Seasonal Adjustment of Housing Data&quot;
Note: I was one of several people to question the change in the seasonal factor (here is a post in 2009) - and this led to S&amp;P Case-Shiller questioning the seasonal factor too (from April 2010).  I still use the seasonal factor (I think it is better than using the NSA data).
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows the month-to-month change in the NSA Case-Shiller National index since 1987 (through October 2021). The seasonal pattern was smaller back in the &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s and increased once the bubble burst. 
The seasonal swings declined following the bubble, however the recent price surge changed the month-over-month pattern.
The second graph shows the seasonal factors for the Case-Shiller National index since 1987.  The factors started to change near the peak of the bubble, and really increased during the bust.   
The swings in the seasonal factors have decreased, and the seasonal factors has been moving back towards more normal levels.

Note that the recent price surge hasn&#x27;t distorted the seasonal factors.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the CalculatedRisk Real Estate Newsletter: Case-Shiller National Index up 19.1% Year-over-year in October
Excerpt: 
Both the Case-Shiller House Price Index (HPI) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) HPI for October were released today. Here is a graph of the month-over-month (MoM) change in the Case-Shiller National Index Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
The MoM increase in Case-Shiller was at 1.03%; still historically high, but lower than the previous 14 months. House prices started increasing sharply in the Case-Shiller index in August 2020, so the last 15 months have all been historically very strong, but the peak MoM growth is behind us - and the year-over-price growth is starting to decelerate.
...

We are seeing the expected deceleration in house price growth, and this trend will probably continue for at least a few more months (more on this tomorrow).  My sense is the Case-Shiller National annual growth rate of 19.99% in August was probably the peak YoY growth rate, however, since the normal level of inventory is probably in the 4 to 6 months range - we’d have to see a significant increase in inventory to sharply slow price increases, and that is why I’m focused on inventory!

대한민국의 불평등을 객관적인 통계를 통해 파헤친 최초의 책이다. 대한민국의 불평등 지표인 가처분소득과 지니계수, 상대적 빈곤율은 OECD 회원국 가운데서 맨 밑바닥에 있다. 이러한 문제는 대한민국이 선진국에 진입했다고 해서 해소되지 않는다. 

이 책은 우리나라가 성장과 발전을 거듭해오는 동안 놓친 노동, 청년, 지방의 불평등은 무엇인지를 통계 제시로 보여준다. 또한, 각종 배제와 소외에 놓인 여성, 노인 그리고 소수자의 삶을 통계를 분석하며 꼼꼼히 살핀다.

선진국 대한민국의 국민은 과연 행복한가? 왜 그들은 늘 힘들고 불안한 삶을 살고 있는가? 그들은 어떤 상황에 놓여 있으며, 그렇게 된 원인은 무엇일까? 이는 곧 불평등의 근원인 노동의 문제로 귀결된다. 『불평등한 선진국』은 대한민국의 노동 현실을 다층적인 통계를 통해서 보여준다. 나아가 저자는 불평등의 중심에 있는 청년 문제를, 소득과 교육 불평등의 통계로  그것의 구조화를 규명한다. 한편 이 책은 우리 사회의 소수자인 결혼 이주 여성과 이주 노동자, 장애인과 여성의 구체적 모습을 놓치지 않는다. 

불평등 문제는 어떻게 해결되어야 하는가? 『불평등한 선진국』은 먼저 대한민국의 불평등을 통계로 볼 것을 제안하고 촉구한다. 그것이 우리의 현실에 대한 고민의 시작이며 대안에 대한 모색이기 때문이다.

한국의 경제ㆍ사회 현실과 다가올 미래의 맥락에서 우리 교육을 경제학적 관점에서 평가하고 분석한 책이다. 특히 효율성, 형평성, 타당성이라는 세 가지 평가 기준을 가지고 우리나라 교육의 역사적 흐름과 현주소를 진단하고, 나아가 피라미드형 교육경쟁사회의 입시제도, 사교육 및 사회자본의 현실 및 문제의 진단과 분석, 인공지능 시대의 교육의 방향과 대안 등을 실증적 연구 데이터에 대한 분석과 현장의 교육 실험 등을 통해 제시한다.

2009년 조사 기준 우리나라 학생들의 주당 공부시간은 초등학생은 44시간, 중학생 52시간, 고등학생 64시간. 2019년 OECD 국가 기준 수학 점수 1위, 그러나 학습효율성지수는 꼴지!  비효율적인 선행ㆍ반복학습 위주의 공부 중노동을 강제하는 교육 외적인 현실에 대한 분석과 왜곡된 사회구조에 대한 진단과 분석을 통해 우리 교육의 문제점을 살펴보고 교육의 효율성과 타당성, 형평성의 관계를 생각해본다.

국가들 간의 상이한 경제성장률은 각국에서의 ‘분배연합들’과 ‘특별이익집단들’을 명시적으로 살펴봄으로써 이해될 수 있다. 오랫동안 정해진 경계선이 변하지 않은 ‘안정된 사회들’에서 시간이 지남에 따라 더 많은 분배연합들이 축적됨으로써 그 사회의 경제적 효율성과 경제성장에 해로운 영향을 미쳐서 궁극적으로 ‘제도경화증’(institutional sclerosis)이 초래되고, 마침내 국가는 쇠퇴의 길을 걷게 된다.

                    <span>Today, in the CalculatedRisk Real Estate Newsletter: Final Look at Local Housing Markets in November
Excerpt: 
This update adds Charlotte, Columbus, Miami, New York, and Phoenix.
  ...
  Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 13.5% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 28.5% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 25.5% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market and suggests we will see new record low inventory levels this Winter.

                    <span>Tracking existing home inventory is very important in 2022.
Inventory usually declines sharply over the holidays - so we will likely see new record lows next week.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of December 24th, inventory was at 310 thousand (7-day average), compared to 437 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 29.0%.  Inventory is down 4.8% from last week.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 60.3% from 783 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 326 thousand, and was down 28.2% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory last week was about 1.3% above the record low set-in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September, when inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 29.0% from the peak for the year.

넷플릭스를 통해 세상을 강타한 ‘오징어 게임’은 사실 ‘제로섬 게임’이다. 내가 이기면 네가 지고 네가 이기면 내가 지는 그런 게임 말이다. 제로섬 게임은 두 개인, 두 기업 등 두 주체 간의 이기고 지는 게임이기도 하지만, 이기는 주체도 지는 주체도 여럿인 게임이기도 하다. 그래서 제로섬 게임에서는 주체들이 얻은 이익을 순서대로 줄을 세워 석차로 나타낼 수 있다. 이익의 양이 아니라 석차만이 의미가 있다.
이 책에서 내가 주장하고 싶은 본질은 후반부의 대책 편에 있다. 혹시나 앞 편을 읽다가 후반부는 읽지 않으면 어쩌나 염려된다. 궁금하신 분들은 후반부터 읽어도 무방하겠다.

머리말

자본주의의 태동부터 지금까지, 금융의 세계에 뛰어든 수많은 참여자는 혁신, 실수 그리고 의도하지 않았던 추문을 통해 지금의 월스트리트를 만들었다. 미국의 억만장자 투자자 겸 피셔 인베스트먼트 설립자이자 33년 동안 《포브스》에 칼럼을 연재한 칼럼니스트 켄 피셔는 자신만의 기준에 따라 월스트리트를 만든 100명의 인물을 선발하여 그들의 업적, 사건, 사생활 등을 매력적인 문체로 풀어냈다. 

그가 선정한 100명이 모두 존경할 만한 인물은 아니다. 하지만 경제학자부터 언론인, 사기범, 투기꾼까지 다양한 분야의 인물로 구성된 이들은 어떤 형태로든 현재의 금융 시장에 절대적인 영향을 미쳤고, 우리는 이들의 짧은 전기를 통해 자본주의를 바라보는 올바른 시각을 얻을 수 있다. 

켄 피셔는 자본주의의 역사 속에서 명예 혹은 불명예를 얻은 100명을 조명하며, 이들의 이야기가 현재에 전하는 메시지가 무엇인지 고찰한다. 그것은 과거는 반복된다는 점이고, 과거를 알지 못하는 자는 실패를 반복하게 된다는 것이다.

                    <span>According to the OECD, social mobility in Germany is lower than in most other developed economies, reigniting a debate on equality of opportunity and shortcomings of the education system. This column discusses how census data can be used to obtain high quality mobility statistics for Germany. Using the Abitur educational qualification as a measure of opportunity, it suggests that relative mobility has remained constant for recent birth cohorts but points to substantial geographic variation in mobility measures across regions in the country.</span>

                    <span>Global warming is expected to dramatically reduce agricultural productivity in hotter parts of the world. This column considers ways to accommodate that change. Hot, poor countries would benefit by shifting away from agriculture into less vulnerable, non-agricultural sectors as temperatures rise, but such a reallocation of resources is unlikely without a major increase in global trade integration. As long as poor countries import little of their food, they are likely to continue specialising in agriculture to meet domestic subsistence needs, even as their farms become increasingly vulnerable to climate change.</span>

                    <span>Inflation has recently surged in both the US and the EU. This column uses responses from surveys of a representative sample of the US population as well as academic economists and US firm managers to show that households and managers are more likely than experts to think that the current surge in inflation will be persistent. Since the narratives individuals use to explain movements in inflation appear central to whether inflation expectations remain anchored, communication strategies by policymakers could put emphasis on specific narratives that highlight that inflationary pressures are unlikely to persist.</span>

                    <span>Rising dispersion in productivity across firms has focused attention on the drivers of superior performances of a minority of firms at the ‘productivity frontier’ and disappointing performances of the remaining ‘productivity laggards’. This column brings together data from ten countries to explore how differences in productivity outcomes of frontier and laggard firms depend on the composition, diversity, and competencies of their managers and their workers. Overall, this ‘human side’ explains about a third of the observed differences in productivity across firms, more than is accounted for by differences in capital intensity.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented fiscal stimulus by many governments to counter the economic recession. This column uses high-frequency data on government spending, lockdown restrictions, and economic indicators in the US to assess the effectiveness of fiscal policy. It shows that government spending increased employment, but only in cities not subject to strict stay-at-home restrictions. It also shows that consumer spending shifted strongly toward durable goods during the pandemic. Well-targeted fiscal measures will be crucial in the case of another recessionary outbreak, especially transfers to firms on the brink of exit.</span>

반도체는 ‘21세기의 전략물자’, ‘산업의 쌀’이라 불리며 휴대폰, PC, 자동차 등의 생산에 꼭 필요한 현대산업에 없어서는 안 될 중요 자원으로 손꼽힌다. 이미 기업 간의 경쟁을 넘어 국가 대 국가로 번지고 있던 반도체 패권을 향한 각국의 움직임이 2020년, 코로나19로 인해 자동차 반도체 품귀가 발생하며 전 세계적인 차원으로 확산됐다. 

각국은 반도체 산업에 대한 지배력이 국가 안보와 경쟁력과 직결된다는 것을 깨닫고, 공급망이 끊겨 문제가 생기지 않도록 반도체 내수화와 핵심 소재 공급망 다변화, 기업간 M&amp;A를 추진하며 국가적 차원의 공격적인 조치와 투자를 단행하고 있다.

훗날 ‘세계 제1차 반도체 대전’으로 기록될지도 모르는 치열한 반도체 패권 다툼 속에서 우리는 어떻게 대처하고 무엇을 준비해야 할까. 한국경제신문 황정수 기자가 현대산업의 중심 실리콘밸리에서 특파원으로 근무하며 취재한 내용을 바탕으로 집필한 이 책을 통해 우리는 반도체 산업에 대한 정확한 이해와 k-반도체의 나아갈 방향을 예측할 수 있을 것이다.

제목 그대로 김우석 작가가 지닌 투자에 관련된 모든 이야기를 모아 놓은 집성체와 같다. 선박금융 프로젝트 분석부터 개인적으로 시작했던 여러 가지 투자 방법과 실패담을 가감 없이 담았다. 또한, 선박의 종류와 그것의 특징을 자세하게 담아 투자 시 이점과 주의해야 할 사항을 파악할 수 있도록 했다.

이 책에는 실제로 그 당시 사람들이 어떻게 투자했고 얼마의 이익을 보았으며, 어떤 규모로 손실을 입었는지 설명하는 것에서 끝나지 않는다. 당시에 투자자가 이익을 보거나 손실을 입은 배경을 설명하고, 그때의 상황에서 어떻게 하면 더 큰 이익을 보았을지 혹은 손실을 피할 수 있었을지를 제시한다. 마치 공부를 잘하는 전교 1등의 오답 노트를 얻게 된 것이나 마찬가지다.

저자는 책에서 선택은 항상 본인의 몫이라는 것을 잊지 말라고 강조한다. 또한 의사결정자는 항상 정직하고 본인에게 엄격해야 한다는 것을 언급한다. 투자는 단 한 번의 기회로 커다란 이익을 볼 수 있는 일명 일확천금의 &#x27;로또&#x27;가 아니다. 철저하게 자신을 분석하고 커다란 세계의 경제를 냉철하게 판단해야만 비로소 조금씩 성공을 거둘 수 있다. 그러한 복잡한 시황 속에서 이른바 &#x27;투자 성공기&#x27;를 맞이하기 위해 고군분투한 저자의 스토리에 주목하기를 바란다.

『선형대수와 통계학으로 배우는 머신러닝 with 파이썬』의 장철원 저자가 선형대수 기초를 다잡고 싶은 독자를 위해 집필한 선형대수 책이다. 기초적인 행렬부터 고차원 텐서까지 선형대수를 구성하는 개념 및 이론을 소개하고 독자 스스로 자신의 분야에 응용할 수 있도록 도와준다. 또한, 선형대수 이론이 의미하는 바를 자세히 설명하고 선형대수 이론을 파이썬 코드로 직접 구현함으로써 내 손으로 선형대수 라이브러리를 직접 만드는 즐거움을 선사한다.

실습은 두 파트로 나뉜다. 파이썬 실습 파트에서는 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 순수 파이썬 코드로 선형대수 이론을 직접 구현해 봄으로써 선형대수 기본기를 탄탄하게 다진다. 넘파이 실습 파트에서는 파이썬에서 제공하는 넘파이 라이브러리를 활용해 선형대수 이론을 활용하는 방법을 다룬다.

                    <span>The Federal Reserve has recently changed monetary stance and signalled a faster than anticipated pace of monetary tightening, while the ECB is more dovish. This column applies a statistical model to recent data on oil prices, inflation, expectations, labour markets and output, and finds that the model’s forecasts support the difference in stance of the two central banks. Based on an assessment of cyclical inflation being mostly driven by transitory energy price disturbances and a very small Phillips curve contribution in both jurisdictions, it predicts that in a year from now euro area HICP inflation will still be below the 2% target, at 1.75%, while in the US CPI inflation will be above, at 2.75%.</span>

                    <span>Carbon pricing is increasingly used by governments to reduce emissions. Using data from 21 European countries, this column considers how education quality interacts with the effect of carbon pricing on emissions, output, and wage inequality. Cognitive skills are associated with lower emissions per output and faster reductions in emissions per output across time. The association is primarily with the cognitive skills of professional and managerial occupations, which would be most involved in innovation and adoption.</span>

                    <span>What are central banks held accountable for by elected officials? This column employs structural topic models on a new dataset of the Monetary Dialogues between the Members of the European Parliament and the President of the ECB to reveal differences in how MEPs keep the ECB accountable for its primary objective of price stability. It also shows that unemployment is a key explanatory variable for the political voice articulated by individual MEPs in accountability settings. These findings reveal the existence of a ‘political’ Phillips curve reaction function.</span>

NFT에 대해 아무것도 모르는 왕초보나 컴맹일지라도 스마트폰 한 대로 직접 NFT를 만들고, 판매하는 방법을 친절히 알려주고 있다. NFT는 도대체 무엇이길래 가격이 매겨지고 거래가 되는지, NFT 거래에서 주의해야 할 전략은 무엇인지 등, 이 책은 필자가 직접 체득한 경험을 바탕으로 독자들이 NFT를 쉽게 배우고 돈 버는데 도움을 주는 내용으로 구성되었기에 이른바 ‘NFT 실전 매뉴얼’이라고 부를 수 있다.

디지털 시대에 리더는 어떤 역할을 해야 하고 어떤 전략과 실행력을 갖추어야 하는지를 담고 있다. 연세대학교 경영대학 임일 교수와 이무원 교수가 함께 썼다. 지금은 IT가 빠르게 세상을 바꿔 가는 4차 산업혁명 시대이자 디지털 대전환의 시대다. 기업 리더들은 워낙 빨리 발전하고 복잡하게 변화하는 IT 기술을 따라가면서 또 미래 전략까지 짜야 하는 어려움에 부닥쳐 있다. 디지털을 하지 않으면 기업 생존이 위험해질 정도로 혁신의 요구와 변화의 속도는 거세고 빠르고 강하다. 그러다 보니 리더십도 더는 과거의 것을 고집하기가 어려워졌다. 디지털 시대에는 그에 맞는 리더십이 요구되기 때문이다. 이른바 디지털 리더십이다. 리더들의 디지털 리더십 전환이 필요하다. 

그럼 디지털 리더십이란 무엇인가? 기존 리더십과는 무엇이 다른가? 이 책에서는 디지털 리더십이란 현재 그리고 앞으로 어떤 디지털 기술을 어떻게 비즈니스에 활용할지에 대한 통찰력을 바탕으로 비즈니스를 이끌어가는 것이라고 정의한다. 디지털 리더십을 갖추려면 디지털 기술에 대한 이해, 디지털 기술 활용으로 얻을 수 있는 비즈니스 기회를 포착하는 통찰력, 그리고 디지털 기술을 효과적으로 실현하는 실행력 등이 필요하다는 것이다.

우리나라에서 가장 오래된 빵집, 근대 유산이 숨쉬는 힙한 관광지로 유명한 군산에 대해 우리가 미처 몰랐던 모습을 담은 르포르타주. 2017년 7월 현대중공업 군산 조선소 가동 중단, 2018년 5월 한국지엠 군산 공장 운영 중단 이후, 저자는 &#x27;몰락한 도시의 사람들은 어떻게 되었는가?&#x27;라는 질문을 안고 군산으로 향했다. 6주 동안 30여 명의 평범한 사람들을 만나 이야기를 나눴다.

공장이 떠난 뒤 그곳에 남겨진 사람들의 삶이 잔인할 정도로 생생하게 기록되어 있다. 매달 지급되던 180만 원 실업 급여 지급이 마감되는 순간, 재취업을 희망했으나 결국 치킨집을 차릴 수밖에 없었던 현실, 실직한 남편 대신 취업 전선에 뛰어드는 아내들, 비정규직 노동자들이 떠받치던 원룸촌과 상가에 남은 떠돌이 개들, 역사와 문화의 도시에서 기업과 함께 사람들도 빠져나가는 과정 등은 단순히 서쪽 끝 작은 도시에서 일어난 일이라고 치부하기엔 너무나도 현실적이다. 2019년 7월 《한겨레21》 커버 기사 〈공장이 떠난 도시 군산〉을 바탕으로 이후의 변화와 저자의 소회까지 담아 한 권의 책으로 엮었다.


프롤로그: 군산 가는 길

1. 토박이: 유별나고 애틋한 사람들
2. 운명들: 정규직과 비정규직
3. 찬란: 세계 도시를 꿈꾸다
4. 균열: 불안한 여유
5. 그날: 공장이 떠나던 날
6. 이별: 남은 사람 떠난 사람
7. 풍경들: 치킨집과 원룸촌
8. 정체성: 어디서 무엇을 할까
9. 1년: 전환과 머뭇거림
10. 쉬어 가는 이야기: 익숙한 도시에서
11. 다시: 그저 평소 같은 하루

에필로그: 혼란으로 엮인

실제 이론을 코드로 구현하는 데에는 많은 현실적인 격차가 존재하고, 이론을 완벽히 이해한다고 해도 코드로 구현한다는 건 또 다른 문제이다. 그래서 이 책에서는 비지도 학습의 이론을 간단하게 살펴본 후에 알고리즘의 이론과 수식을 여러 단계로 나누고 파이썬 코드로 단계별 결과들을 최대한 상세하게 다루었다.

또한 텐서플로 2의 오토 인코더와 함께 사용하는 주요 딥러닝 이론들을 실습하고 딥러닝의 활성화 함수, 손실 함수, RNN, CNN, LSTM 등을 소개한다. 마지막으로 다양한 예제 데이터와 함께 그동안 배웠던 이론을 적용하고 머신러닝으로 직접 코딩하면서 결과물을 완성할 수 있도록 했다.

필요한 자금을 계산해보자
자연스럽게 저축하는 몸을 만들자
많은 돈을 모을 수 있는 골든타임
돈을 모으는 목적은 주택 구입이 아니다
돈을 모으는 동안 공부를 해야 한다
도박과 투자의 차이점은 불확실함의 정도
떠올려보자! 누구에게나 투자 성공 경험이 있다
적립식 펀드로 재밌게 실용적인 공부를 하라
분산투자는 나중에, 지금은 집중하자

4장 MZ세대가 부동산에 투자하는 법
많은 투자 상품 중 무엇부터 공부해야 할까?
소액 아파트 투자, 이렇게 성공했다
부동산 규제 정책이 실패한 이유

기본소득은 과연 가능할까. 인공지능과 로봇이 인간의 노동력을 대체할 미래에는 기본소득으로 불평등과 빈곤문제를 해결할 것으로 전망하는 실정이다. 제도의 취지나 당위로는 더할 나위가 없다. 관건은 재원 마련이다. 막대한 돈이 드는 기본소득을 현실로 옮길 수 있을까. 이 책 『모두의 기본소득, 재원을 마련하다』의 저자들은 “기본소득 지급도, 재원조달도 모두 가능하다”고 입을 모은다.

기본소득 재원 마련의 철학적 기초는 ‘공유부’에 있다. 토지, 환경, 지식, 데이터 등 모두에게 속한 공유부의 수익을 평등하게 나눈다는 것이다. 이 책은 기본소득으로 지급할 수 있는 재원으로서, 공유부에 근거해 정당성을 획득한 모든 방안을 다룬다.

기본소득 금액을 먼저 정하고 이에 부합하는 재정모델을 설정한 다음 지급 방안을 마련하는 접근과는 다르다. 조달 가능한 재원을 최대한으로 모색하고 그 규모를 추계해 제시하는 방식이다. 실현가능한 재원조달 방안들과 조달액 추계 범위 내에서 상황에 따라 단계별로 취할 수 있는 조합을 모색하는 데 도움이 된다.
