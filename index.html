                    <span>U.S. state pensions are underfunded by trillions of dollars, but their economic burden is unclear. In a model of inefficient taxation, real estate fully reflects the cost of pension shortfalls when it is the only form of immobile capital. We study the effect of pension shortfalls on real estate values at state borders, where labor and physical capital could more easily relocate to a state with a smaller shortfall. Using plausibly exogenous variation driven by pension asset returns, we find that one dollar of pension underfunding reduces house prices near state borders by approximately two dollars. Our estimates imply a deadweight loss associated with addressing pension shortfalls that is consistent with prior research in settings with high returns to public spending and costs of taxation.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the economic consequences of the West’s foray into China after the Opium War (1839-42), when Western colonial influence was introduced in dozens of so-called treaty ports. We document a turnaround during the 19th century in the nature of China’s capital markets. Whereas before the Opium War, coastal cities were of relatively minor importance, the treaty port system of the West transformed China into an economy focused on coastal areas and on international trade that aligned with the trading interests of the West. We show, first, that the West had a positive impact on China’s economy during the 19th century. It brought down local interest rates, and regions under Western influence exhibited both higher rates of industry growth and technology adoption. Second, the geographic scope of influence went far beyond the ports, impacting most of China. Interest rates fell by more than a quarter in the immediate vicinity of the ports and still by almost ten percent at distances of 450 kilometers from treaty ports. The development of China was not simply propelled by its own pre-1800 history, or by post-1978 reforms. The nearly 100 years of semi-colonization have shaped China’s economy today as one focused on the coastal areas.</span>

                    <span>Two hallmarks of U.S. monetary policy since the 1981-1982 recession have been declining interest rates and moderation in inflation. Coincident with these trends has been a surge in U.S. wealth inequality, with the Gini coefficient up by 0.070 between 1983 and 2019. This paper analyzes the connection between these two developments on the basis of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Contrary to expectations, the paper finds that these two monetary effects have reduced wealth inequality rather than increasing it. The effect is sizeable, with the Gini coefficient declining by 0.045 over these years. Asset price changes and debt devaluation accounted for 72.6 percent of the advance of mean wealth over 1983-2019. They also would have led to a 204.9 percent gain in median wealth, compared to the actual rise of 23.4 percent. Moreover, they have helped lower the racial wealth gap rather than enlarging it. These results are at odds with previous literature in which estimates range from a weak negative effect on inequality to neutral, small positive, and strong positive. In terms of methodology, this paper differs from previous work by focusing on only the direct effects of interest rate changes and inflation on the household balance sheet.</span>

                    <span>Abstract We evaluate the duration of the China trade shock and its impact on a wide range of outcomes over the period 2000 to 2019. The shock plateaued in 2010, enabling analysis of its effects for nearly a decade past its culmination. Adverse impacts of import competition on manufacturing employment, overall employment-population ratios, and income per capita in more trade-exposed U.S. commuting zones are present out to 2019. Over the full study period, greater import competition implies a reduction in the manufacturing employment-population ratio of 1.54 percentage points, which is 55% of the observed change in the value, and the absorption of 86% of this net job loss via a corresponding decrease in the overall employment rate. Reductions in population headcounts, which indicate net out-migration, register only for foreign-born workers and the native-born 25-39 years old, implying that exit from work is a primary means of adjustment to trade-induced contractions in labor demand. More negatively affected regions see modest increases in the uptake of government transfers, but these transfers primarily take the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Adverse outcomes are more acute in regions that initially had fewer college-educated workers and were more industrially specialized. Impacts are qualitatively—but not quantitatively—similar to those caused by the decline of employment in coal production since the 1980s, indicating that the China trade shock holds lessons for other episodes of localized job loss. Import competition from China induced changes in income per capita across local labor markets that are much larger than the spatial heterogeneity of income effects predicted by standard quantitative trade models. Even using higher-end estimates of the consumer benefits of rising trade with China, a substantial fraction of commuting zones appears to have suffered absolute declines in average real incomes.</span>

                    <span>Many governments have engaged in policy experimentation in various forms to resolve uncertainty and facilitate learning. However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China’s policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find three main results. First, more than 80% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality’s economic development, and much of this can be attributed to misaligned incentives across political hierarchies. Second, local politicians allocate more resources to ensure the experiments’ success, and such effort is not replicable when policies roll out to the entire country. Third, the presence of sample selection and strategic effort is not fully accounted for by the central government, thus affecting policy learning and distorting national policies originating from the experimentation. Taken together, these results suggest that while China’s bureaucratic and institutional conditions make policy experimentation at such scale possible, the complex political environments can also limit the scope and bias the direction of policy learning.</span>

                    <span>In the United States, households obtain health insurance through distinct market segments. We explore the economics of this segmentation by comparing coverage provided through small employers versus the individual marketplace. Using data from Oregon, we find households with group coverage spend 26% less on covered health care than households with individual coverage yet face higher markups. We develop a model of plan choice and health spending to estimate preferences in both markets and evaluate integration policies. In our setting, pooling can both mitigate adverse selection in the individual market and benefit small group households without raising taxpayer costs.</span>

                    <span>Can financial incentives, public health messages and other behavioral nudges –approaches deployed by state and local governments, employers, and health systems – increase SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates among the vaccine hesitant in the US? In mid-2021, we randomly assigned unvaccinated members of a Medicaid managed care health plan to $10 or $50 financial incentives, different public health messages, a simple appointment scheduler, or control to assess impacts on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination intentions and vaccine uptake within 30 days of intervention. While messages increased vaccination intentions, none of the treatments increased overall vaccination rates. Consistent with backlash concerns, financial incentives and negative messages decreased vaccination rates for some subgroups. Financial incentives and other behavioral nudges do not meaningfully increase SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates amongst the vaccine hesitant.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the role and incidence of entry preemption strategic motives on the dynamics of new industries, while providing an empirical test for entry preemption, and quantifying its impact on market structure. The empirical context is the evolution of the U.S. drive-in theater market between 1945 and 1957. We exploit a robust prediction of dynamic entry games to test for preemption incentives: the deterrence effect of entering early is only relevant for firms in markets of intermediate size. Potential entrants in small and large markets face little uncertainty about the actual number of firms that will eventually enter. This leads to a non-monotonic relationship between market size and the probability of observing an early entrant. We find robust empirical support for this prediction using a large cross-section of markets. We then estimate the parameters of a dynamic entry game that matches the reduced-form prediction and quantify the strength of the preemption incentive. Our counterfactual analysis shows that strategic motives can increase the number of early entrants by as much as 50 percent in mid-size markets without affecting the number of firms in the long run. By causing firms to enter the market too early, we show that strategic entry preemption leads on average to a 5% increase in entry costs and a 1% decrease in firms&#x27; expected value (relative to an environment without strategic investments).</span>

                    <span>We estimate the likelihood of financial distress of U.S. hospitals in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic using AHA Annual Survey data for 2011-2019 and smartphone mobility data for 2020. We find that while the average likelihood of distress across all hospitals is 28.53 % in 2020, slightly increasing from 2019, for-profit hospitals are much more likely to be distressed. Their average likelihood of financial distress is 39.13 %---a 6.93 percentage point increase from 2019. For-profit hospitals are the main providers of specialty health care services, such as psychiatric and acute long-term care, so their increased likelihood of distress poses a risk to service provision in these specialty areas, and particularly in rural communities. Our prediction model based on mobility data performs very well in sample against actual data and can potentially help policymakers and hospital administrators to monitor financial distress in real-time when case mixes change, or other large shocks materialize.</span>

Reallocating activity to the form it would have taken prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 accounts for one third of the decline in the corporate sector labor share between 1978 and 2017. Our adjustments are concentrated among mid-market firms in services, leaving a larger role for the manufacturing sector and superstar firms in driving the remaining decline in the labor share. Our findings highlight the importance of tax policy when measuring factor shares.</span>

                    <span>We present a tractable dynamic macroeconomic model of self-fulfilling bank runs. A bank is vulnerable to a run when a loss of investors&#x27; confidence triggers deposit withdrawals and leads the bank to default on its obligations.  We analytically characterize how the vulnerability of an individual bank depends on macroeconomic aggregates and how the number of banks facing a run affects macroeconomic aggregates in turn. In general equilibrium, runs can be partial or complete, depending on aggregate leverage and the dynamics of asset prices. Our normative analysis shows that the effectiveness of credit easing and its welfare implications depend on whether a financial crisis is driven by fundamentals or by self-fulfilling runs.</span>

                    <span>We find evidence that exposure to universal free school meals through the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) had a meaningful impact on grocery spending for households with children, with monthly food purchases declining by about $11, or 5 percent. For households in zip codes with higher exposure, the decline is as high as $39 per month, or 19 percent. We also show evidence that the composition of food purchases changes, with low income households experiencing an increase in the dietary quality of their food purchases by about 3 percent after CEP. Finally, we show CEP exposure is associated with an 11 percent decline in the percent of households that ran short of money or tried to make their food money go further, and an almost 5 percent decline in households classified as food insecure. Our results on the heterogeneous effects of CEP exposure by prior free/reduced price lunch eligibility reveal large benefits in terms of both spending, dietary composition, and food insecurity for previously eligible low-income families, suggesting that the stigma of free school meals may be declining after universal access.</span>

                    <span>We document that nearly half of the global decline in agricultural employment during the 20th-century was driven by new cohorts entering the labor market. A newly compiled dataset of policy reforms supports an interpretation of these cohort effects as human capital. Through the lens of a model of frictional labor reallocation, we conclude that human capital growth, both as a mediating factor and as an independent driver, led to a sharp decline in the agricultural labor supply. This decline accounts, at fixed prices, for 40% of the decrease in agricultural employment. This aggregate effect is roughly halved in general equilibrium.</span>

                    <span>Socioeconomic inequalities in child development crystallize at early stages, with associated disparities in parental investment in children. A key to understanding the data patterns is to document the sources underlying the observed inequalities. We first show that there are dramatic differences in parental beliefs across socioeconomic backgrounds (SES), with parents of higher SES being more likely to believe that parental investments impact child development. We then use two field experiments targeted to low-SES families to explore the mutability of such beliefs and their link to parental investments. In both cases, we find that parental beliefs about child development are malleable. The less intensive version of the program based on educational videos changes parental beliefs, but fails to lastingly increase parental investments and child outcomes. By contrast, in the more intensive version of our program combining home visits and feedback, the augmented beliefs are associated with enriched parent-child interactions and improved vocabulary, math, and social-emotional skills for the children. Together, these results suggest that changing parental beliefs can be an important pathway to raising parental investments and reducing socioeconomic gaps in children’s skills, but that simple informational policies may not be sufficient.</span>

                    <span>We find that sin good purchases are highly concentrated with 10% of households paying more than 80% of taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. Total sin tax burdens are poorly explained by demographics (including income), but are well explained by eight household clusters defined by purchasing patterns. The two most taxed clusters comprise 8% of households, pay 68% of sin taxes, are older, less educated, and lower income. Taxes on sugary beverages broaden the tax base but add to the burdens of heavily taxed households. Efforts to increase sin taxes should consider the heavy burdens borne by few households.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we provide detailed analyses of the Bitcoin network and its main participants. We build a novel database using a large number of public and proprietary sources to link Bitcoin addresses to real entities and develop an extensive suite of algorithms to extract information about the behavior of the main market participants. We conduct three major pieces of analysis of the Bitcoin eco-system. First, we analyze the transaction volume and network structure of the main participants on the blockchain. Second, we document the concentration and regional composition of the miners which are the backbone of the verification protocol and ensure the integrity of the blockchain ledger. Finally, we analyze the ownership concentration of the largest holders of Bitcoin.</span>

                    <span>From 2011 to 2014, the Brazilian government conducted a heavily advertised major credit expansion program through government banks as part of its effort to stimulate the economy. Using administrative data on individual-level borrowing and spending, we find that the program led to a substantial rise in borrowing by government employees, especially those with low financial literacy. We trace the impact of credit stimulus on borrowers&#x27; consumption through the 2011-16 business cycle, and find that the credit stimulus resulted in higher consumption volatility and lower average consumption over the cycle. Our results suggest a potential downside of using household credit as stimulus in emerging markets.</span>

                    <span>To what extent did an expansion and contraction of credit drive the 2000s housing boom and bust? The existing literature lacks consensus, with findings ranging from credit having no effect to credit driving most of the house price cycle. We show that the key difference behind these disparate results is the extent to which credit insensitive agents such as landlords and unconstrained savers absorb credit-driven demand, which depends on the degree of segmentation in housing markets. We develop a model with frictional rental markets that allows us to consider cases in between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically assumed in the literature. We argue that the relative elasticities of the price-rent ratio and homeownership with respect to an identified credit shock is a sufficient statistic to measure the degree of segmentation. We estimate this moment using three different credit supply instruments and use it to calibrate our model. Our results reveal that rental markets are highly frictional and closer to fully segmented, which implies large effects of credit on house prices. In particular, changes to credit standards can explain between 34% and 55% of the rise in price-rent ratios over the boom.</span>

                    <span>We study the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals selected from the general population of poor households in rural Ghana. Results from 2-3 months after a randomized intervention show strong impacts on mental and physical health, cognitive and socioemotional skills, and downstream economic outcomes. We find no evidence of heterogeneity by baseline mental distress; we argue that this is because CBT can improve human capital for a general population of poor individuals through two pathways. First, CBT reduces vulnerability to deteriorating mental health; and second, CBT directly improves bandwidth, increasing cognitive and socioemotional skills and hence economic outcomes.</span>

                    <span>Spatial differences in labor market performance are large and highly persistent. Using data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we document striking similarities in spatial differences in unemployment, vacancies, job finding, and job filling within each country. This robust set of facts guides and disciplines the development of a theory of local labor market performance. We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities. The model also quantitatively rationalizes why differences in job-separation rates have primary importance in inducing differences in unemployment across space while changes in the job-finding rate are the main driver in unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.</span>

                    <span>Collective decision making requires preference aggregation even if no ideal aggregation method exists (Arrow, 1950). We investigate how individuals think groups should aggregate members&#x27; ordinal preferences—that is, how they interpret &quot;the will of the people.&quot; Our experiment elicits revealed attitudes toward ordinal preference aggregation and classifies subjects according to the rules they implicitly deploy. Majoritarianism is rare while rules that promote compromise are common. People evaluate relative sacrifice by inferring cardinal utility from ordinal ranks. Cluster analysis reveals that our classification encompasses all important aggregation rules. Aggregation methods exhibit stability across domains and across countries with divergent traditions.</span>

                    <span>Using a structural life-cycle model and data on school visits from Safegraph and school closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-Schuendeln, Krueger, Ludwig and Popova (2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools, empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top- to children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8 percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income. Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3. A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers) generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax approximately sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.</span>

                    <span>The current mini-surge in inflation is forecast to return to central bank targets towards the end of 2022, or shortly thereafter. However, there is also a risk of inflation remaining persistently high for longer. This column discusses the implications of such a contingency for central banks and monetary policy. The authors warn that sudden policy reversals could lead to severe downturns in financial markets and significantly damage public sector balance sheets. Instead, they call on central banks to develop concrete plans for dealing with persistently higher inflation, with a particular focus on their balance sheet policies in a world of rising nominal interest rates.</span>

                    <span>Big Techs’ expansion into financial services can bring competition, efficiency, and inclusion, particularly in emerging market and developing economics. But it also gives rise to issues concerning a level playing field with banks, operational risk, too-big-to-fail issues, as well as challenges for antitrust rules and consumer protection. This column presents a policy triangle that highlights the trade-offs between three objectives: financial stability, competition, and data privacy. Handling these challenges requires more coordination on rules and standards, both between domestic authorities and across international borders.</span>

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Highest Rates Since April, But There&#x27;s a Catch
Over the past 30 days, interest rates have risen sharply. This is true for both mortgage rates and bond market benchmarks like 10yr Treasury yields. ...
Translation: at the beginning of the month, traders only saw a small chance of the first rate hike happening in September and no chance for June.  Fast forward 3 weeks and September is seen as 100% likely and June is up to about a 60% chance. [30 year fixed 3.27%]

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of October 19th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearance Declines Hit Mid-Month Lull
After two weeks of sizable drops in the number of active forbearance plans (as hundreds of thousands of homeowners reached the end of their allowable terms), we saw much more modest improvement this week – the same mid-month lull in removal activity that we’ve been reporting on for many months now.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans fell by just 7,300 (-0.6%) this week, with declines of 10,500 among FHA/VA loans and 2,800 among GSE mortgages being partially offset by a 6,000 rise in plan volumes among portfolio and PLS mortgages. That’s substantially less than last week’s 143,000 (10%) drop.
As of October 19, 1.24 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 2.3% of all active mortgages, including 1.3% of GSE, 3.9% of FHA/VA and 3% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
 Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Still, on a monthly basis, improvement remains strong, with forbearances declining by 356,000 (-22.3%) over the past 30 days, and the past few weeks have seen the fastest monthly rates of improvement since the start of the pandemic.
Some 432,000 homeowners left forbearance in the first 19 days of October, making it the largest single month in terms of exit volumes since October of last year. And with more than 280,000 plans still up for review through the end of October, significant opportunity remains for additional declines through the first few weeks of November.

Here is a table of some of the forecasts over the last 3 months.  The significant downgrades during the quarter were primarily due to analysts underestimating the impact of the recent COVID wave, and also the impact of supply chain disruptions.

변화하는 국제 정세 속에서 새로운 중심지로 떠오른 동북아시아의 대표 국가 남북중의 관계에 대해 다루고, 나아가 동북아의 밝은 미래를 위한 남북중의 협력 방안을 모색한다.

1997년의 아시아 외환위기 이후 2000년대에 동아시아 지역주의의 움직임이 활성화되어 많은 역내 정책 협력이 추진되었다. 하지만 현재 동북아시아는 미중 전략 경쟁, 급변하는 남북관계, 코로나19로 인한 보건 위기 등 다양한 위기 상황에 놓여 있다. 

미중 전략경쟁은 지금부터 시작이고 보건 위기는 언젠가 해소될 가능성이 높지만, 당분간은 교류협력이 어려운 것이 현실이다. 이렇듯 침체된 국제 분위기 속이기에 더욱, 변화하는 현실 속에서 남북중이 교류와 협력을 통해 보다 상호이익의 관계로 한 발짝 더 다가갈 수 있도록 만들 논의가 필요하다.

이에 한반도 문제를 포함한 동북아 정세에 대한 공통의 관심을 가지고 그간 부산과 창춘에서 공동으로 한중 동북아지역 협력세미나를 주최해온 동서대학교 동아시아연구원 중국연구센터와 지린대학교 동북아연구원은 협력 5주년을 기념하여 이 책을 발간하고, 이를 통해 남북중 3자 협력의 초석을 마련하고자 한다.

                    <span>The impacts of environmental change on human outcomes often depend on local exposures and behavioral responses that are challenging to observe with traditional administrative or sensor data. We show how data from private pollution sensors, cell phones, social media posts, and internet search activity yield new insights on exposures and behavioral responses during large wildfire smoke events across the US, a rapidly-growing environmental stressor. Health-protective behavior, mobility, and sentiment all respond to increasing ambient wildfire smoke concentrations, but responses differ by income.  Indoor pollution monitors provide starkly different estimates of likely personal exposure during smoke events than would be inferred from traditional ambient outdoor sensors, with similar outdoor pollution levels generating &gt;20x differences in average indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Our results suggest that the current policy reliance on self protection to mitigate health risks in the face of rising smoke exposure will result in modest and unequal benefits.</span>

                    <span>Using a new survey of firms’ inflation expectations in France, we provide novel evidence about the measurement and formation of inflation expectations on the part of firms. First, French firms report inflation expectations with a smaller, but still positive, bias than households and display less disagreement. Second, we characterize the extent and manner in which the wording of questions matters for the measurement of firms’ inflation expectations. Third, we document whether and how the position of the respondent within the firm affects the provided responses. Fourth, because our survey measures firms’ expectations about aggregate and firm-level wage growth along with their inflation expectations, we are able to show that expectations about wages are even more condensed than firms’ inflation expectations and almost completely uncorrelated with them, indicating that firms perceive little link between price and wage inflation. Finally, an experimental treatment indicates that an exogenous change in firms’ inflation expectations has no effect on their aggregate wage expectations.</span>

                    <span>A busy airport’s closure has large effects on noise, real estate markets, and neighborhood demographics. Using a unique dataset, we examine the effects of closing Denver’s Stapleton Airport on nearby housing markets. We find evidence of immediate anticipatory price effects upon announcement, but no price changes at closing and little evidence of upward trending prices between announcement and closing. However, after the airport closure, more higher-income and fewer black households moved in, and developers built higher quality houses. Finally, post-closing, these demographic and housing stock changes had substantial housing price effects, even after restricting the sample to pre-existing housing sales.</span>

Recognizing the potential trade-offs, the paper asks whether China’s experience indicates that income-polarization was a by-product of past economic progress, including poverty reduction. The paper does not find robust time-series evidence of polarizing effects alongside either economic growth or population urbanization (including among those below the national median). There was strong co-movement between polarization and inequality. Larger urban-rural gaps in mean incomes are strongly polarizing in China.</span>

                    <span>Economic data engineering deliberately designs novel forms of data to solve fundamental identification problems associated with economic models of choice. I outline three diverse applications: to the economics of information; to life-cycle employment, earnings, and spending; and to public policy analysis. In all three cases one and the same fundamental identification problem is driving data innovation: that of separately identifying appropriately rich preferences and beliefs. In addition to presenting these conceptually linked examples, I provide a general overview of the engineering process, outline important next steps, and highlight larger opportunities.</span>

                    <span>This paper uses administrative tax data to estimate top wealth in the United States. We assemble new data that links people to their sources of capital income and develop new methods to estimate the degree of return heterogeneity within asset classes. Disaggregated fixed income data reveal that rich individuals earn much more of their interest income in higher-yielding forms, and have much greater exposure to credit risk. Consequently, in recent years, the interest rate on fixed income at the top is approximately three times higher than the average. Using firm-level characteristics to value firms, we find that twenty percent of total pass-through business wealth accrues to those with losses. We combine this new data on fixed income and pass-through business returns with refined estimates of C-corporation equity, housing, and pension wealth to deliver new capitalized wealth estimates. Our approach---which builds on Saez and Zucman (2016) and Bricker, Henriques, and Hansen (2018)---reduces bias because wealth and rates of return are correlated. From 1989 to 2016, the top 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% wealth shares increased by 7.6, 5.1, and 3.0 percentage points, respectively, to 31.5%, 15.0%, and 7.0%. While these changes are less dramatic than some prior estimates, wealth is very concentrated: the top 1% holds nearly as much wealth as either the bottom 90% or the &quot;P90-99&quot; class. We discuss implications for income inequality measures, capital tax policy, and savings behavior.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced huge numbers of employers and employees to remote work. How many of these newly remote jobs will go overseas? We offer a rough quantification based on two observations: 1) offshore work is trade in services, and 2) the number of telemigrants is the volume of this trade divided by the average wage. Combining these with gravity-model estimates, we can roughly predict the number of new telemigrants that would arise from lower barriers to trade in services. Telemigration seems unlikely to be transformative when it comes to the development paths of most emerging economies. The baseline service trade flows are modest, and the standard gravity model restricts modest changes to have modest impacts. There are no tipping points in structural gravity models. Finally, we propose a simple model of telemigration in which small changes can have large consequences. The key is to assume that latent comparative advantage takes a different shape than typically assumed in quantitative trade models. Given this, small changes in trade costs can generate large and asymmetric increases in the exports of service tasks from low-wage nations.</span>

After controlling for small-sample biases, we find evidence of in-sample predictability. Our text measures, derived using energy news articles, hold their own against traditional variables. While we cannot identify ex-ante rules for selecting successful out-of-sample forecasters, an analysis of all possible two-variable models reveals out-of-sample performance above that expected under random variation. Our findings provide new directions for identifying robust forecasting models for oil markets, and beyond.</span>

                    <span>Based on responses in the General Social Survey, we construct an index that captures non-monetary qualities of occupations, such as respect, learning, and work hazards, relevant to the well-being of workers. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, we document that the children of richer US parents are more likely to select into occupations that rank higher in terms of this index. We rationalize this fact by introducing occupational choice with preferences over the intrinsic qualities of occupations into a standard theory of intergenerational mobility. Estimating the model allows us to infer the equivalent monetary compensation each worker receives from the intrinsic qualities of their chosen occupation. Earnings adjusted to reflect this additional compensation show substantially larger persistence of income from parents to children. Our model further predicts that the trends in the composition of labor demand in the US over the past three decades decreased intergenerational persistence, and also led to higher growth in the welfare of the average worker than that implied by observed earnings.</span>

                    <span>Many decisions – such as what educational or career path to pursue – are dynamic in nature, with individuals receiving feedback at one point in time and making decisions later. Using a controlled experiment, with two sessions one week apart, we analyze the dynamic effects of feedback on beliefs about own performance and decision-making across two different domains (verbal skills and math). We find significant gender gaps in beliefs and choices before feedback: men are more optimistic about their performance and more willing to compete than women in both domains, but the gaps are significantly larger in math. Feedback significantly shifts individuals&#x27; beliefs and choices. Despite this, we see substantial persistence of gender gaps over time. This is particularly true among the set of individuals who receive negative feedback. We find that, holding fixed performance and decisions before feedback, women update their beliefs and choices more negatively than men do after bad news. Our results highlight the challenges involved in overcoming gender gaps in dynamic settings.</span>

                    <span>We study the private market response to the National School Lunch Program, documenting economically meaningful spillovers to non-recipients. We focus on the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), an expansion of the lunch program under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Under the CEP, participating schools offer free lunch to all students. We leverage both the staggered roll-out and eligibility criterion for the CEP, which is limited to schools where at least 40% of students participate in other means-tested welfare programs. We find that local adoption of the CEP causes households with children to reduce their grocery purchases, leading to a 10% decline in grocery sales at large retail chains. Retailers respond with chain-level price adjustments: chains with the most exposure lower prices by 2.5% across all outlets in the years following adoption, so that the program&#x27;s welfare benefits propagate spatially. Using a stylized model of grocery demand, we estimate that, by 2016, the indirect benefit had reduced grocery costs for the median household by approximately 4.5%.</span>

                    <span>The relationship between the degree of inequality and the demand for redistribution has been a central question in political science and political economy. The famous median-voter model predicts that higher inequality, reflected in a growing gap between the income of the average and the median voter, should lead to increased demand for redistribution, as policymakers cater to the median voter’s preferences (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). Yet, using data from OECD countries, Kenworthy and McCall (2008) show that, despite increases in inequality in those countries, there was no corresponding increase in demand for redistribution. Part of the explanation of this puzzle lies in the realization that it is not only (or even mainly) reality, but perceptions that shape support for policy. This article will explore recent evidence using large-scale social economics surveys and experiments that sheds lights on beliefs about inequality, social mobility, diversity and immigration, social position, and understanding of how policies work.</span>

We find that the desire to engage in voluntary giving decreases significantly with group size. However, voting for group-wide redistribution is precisely estimated to not depend on group size. Moreover, people’s perception of the size of their reference group is malleable, and affects their desire to give. These results suggest that government programs, such as progressive tax-and-transfer systems, can help satisfy other-regarding preferences for redistribution in a way that creating opportunities for voluntary giving cannot.</span>

                    <span>This Handbook chapter seeks to introduce students and researchers of industrial organization (IO) to the field of market design. We emphasize two important points of connection between the IO and market design fields: a focus on market failures—both understanding sources of market failure and analyzing how to fix them—and an appreciation of institutional detail. 
Section II reviews theory, focusing on introducing the theory of matching and assignment mechanisms to a broad audience. It introduces a novel “taxonomy” of market design problems, covers the key mechanisms and their properties, and emphasizes several points of connection to traditional economic theory involving prices and competitive equilibrium. 
Section III reviews structural empirical methods that build on this theory. We describe how to estimate a workhorse random utility model under various data environments, ranging from data on reported preference data such as rank-order lists to data only on observed matches. These methods enable a quantification of trade-offs in designing markets and the effects of new market designs. 
Section IV discusses a wide variety of applications. We organize this discussion into three broad aims of market design research: (i) diagnosing market failures; (ii) evaluating and comparing various market designs; (iii) proposing new, improved designs. A point of emphasis is that theoretical and empirical analysis have been highly complementary in this research.</span>

                    <span>Do low interest rates contribute to the rise in market concentration? Using data on firm financials and high frequency monetary policy shocks, we find that falling interest rates disproportionately benefit industry leaders, especially when the initial interest rate is already low. Falling rates raise the valuation of industry leaders relative to industry followers and this effect snowballs as the interest rate approaches zero. There are multiple channels through which falling rates disproportionately benefit industry leaders: (i) the cost of borrowing falls more for industry leaders, (ii) industry leaders are able to raise more debt, increase leverage, and buyback more shares, and (iii) capital investment and acquisitions increase more for industry leaders. All three of these effects also snowball as the interest rate approaches zero. The findings provide empirical support to the idea that extremely low interest rates and the rise of superstar firms are connected.</span>

                    <span>Health insurance may play an important role not only in immediate access to care but in the management of chronic disease, which would have implications for long-run care needs as well as health outcomes.  Such causal connections are often difficult to establish, but we use Oregon’s 2008 Medicaid lottery to assess the management of diabetes and asthma, as well as several markers of physical health.  This analysis complements several prior studies by introducing new data elements and by analyzing chronically ill subpopulations.  While we had previously found that having insurance increases the diagnosis and use of medication for diabetes, we show here that it does not significantly increase the likelihood of diabetic patients receiving recommended care such as eye exams and regular blood sugar monitoring, nor does it improve the management of patients with asthma.  We also find no effect on measures of physical health including pulse, obesity, or blood markers of chronic inflammation.  Effects of Medicaid on health care utilization appear similar for those with and without pre-lottery diagnoses of chronic physical health conditions.  Thus, while Medicaid is an important determinant of access to care overall, it does not appear that Medicaid alone has detectable effects on the management of several chronic physical health conditions, at least over the first two years in this setting.  However, sample limitations highlight the value of additional research.</span>

This pay-performance relationship is particularly strong amongst higher paid employees, with a doubling of firm productivity associated with 11% more pay for the highest-paid employee (likely the CEO) compared to 4.7% for the median worker. This pay-performance link holds in public and private firms, although it is almost twice as strong in public firms for the highest-paid employees.

                    <span>Due to their short lifespans and migrating moneyness, options are notoriously difficult to study with the factor models commonly used to analyze the risk-return trade-off in other asset classes. Instrumented principal components analysis solves this problem by tracking contracts in terms of their pricing-relevant characteristics via time-varying latent factor loadings. We find that a model with three latent factors prices the cross-section of option returns and explains more than 85% of the variation in a panel of monthly S&amp;P 500 option returns from 1996 to 2017. In particular, we show that the IPCA factors can be rationalized via an economically plausible three-factor model consisting of a level, slope and skew factor. Finally, out-of-sample trading strategies based on insights from the IPCA model have significant alpha over previously studied option strategies.</span>

                    <span>Economic shocks are notoriously difficult to predict but recent research suggests qualitative metrics about economic actors’ expectations are predictive of downturns.  We show consumer expectations indices from both the Conference Board and the University of Michigan predict economic downturns up to 18 months in advance in the United States, both at national and at state-level.  All the recessions since the 1980s have been predicted by at least 10 and sometimes many more point drops in these expectations indices.  A single monthly rise of at least 0.3 percentage points in the unemployment rate also predicts recession, as does two consecutive months of employment rate declines.  The economic situation in 2021 is exceptional, however, since unprecedented direct government intervention in the labor market through furlough-type arrangements has enabled employment rates to recover quickly from the huge downturn in 2020.  However, downward movements in consumer expectations in the last six months suggest the economy in the United States is entering recession now (Autumn 2021) even though employment and wage growth figures suggest otherwise.</span>

                    <span>As life expectancy increases, so does the importance of a fair pension system that reflects our contribution but won&#x27;t leave anyone in poverty. Can we create a progressive pension system that doesn&#x27;t discourage work? Fabian Kindermann tells Tim Phillips how it could be designed.

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic represents a twin health and economic shock with devastating effects, particularly in low-income settings. This column uses a large phone survey and leverages the geographical variation in India&#x27;s containment policies to examine how the pandemic and its containment policies affect women’s wellbeing. The authors find that stricter containment policies, while potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases, are associated with worse female mental health and increased food insecurity, particularly for the most vulnerable women.</span>

                    <span>Note: Since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic, CoStar is comparing to 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Occupancy Reaches Highest Level Since Mid-August
U.S. hotel occupancy reached its highest level since mid-August, while room rates dipped from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through October 16.
October 10-16, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 65.0% (-10%)
• verage daily rate (ADR): $134.03 (-1.4%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $87.15 (-11.3%)
Week-over-week demand growth came almost exclusively from the Sunday ahead of Columbus Day. Overall for the three-day holiday weekend (8-10 October), occupancy reached 72% as compared with 75% in 2019.
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The Summer months had decent occupancy with solid leisure travel, and occupancy was only off about 7% in July and August compared to 2019.


Usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.   However, this year, so far, business travel has been lighter than leisure travel in 2021.</span>

                    <span>Notes: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Also, incoming port traffic is backed up significantly in the LA area with numerous ships at anchor waiting to unload.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation&#x27;s container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was down 0.4% in September compared to the rolling 12 months ending in August.   Outbound traffic was down 2.0% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports - and with the backlog of ships, will probably continue strong.
Imports were down 4% YoY in September (recovered last year following the early months of the pandemic), and exports were down 23% YoY.</span>

Excerpt: 
On prices, the NAR reported:
The median existing-home price for all housing types in September was $352,800, up 13.3% from September 2020 ($311,500), as prices rose in each region.
Median prices are distorted by the mix (repeat sales indexes like Case-Shiller and FHFA are probably better for measuring prices), but this is the fourth consecutive month with a deceleration in the median price.  The NAR reported median prices were up 23.6% YoY in May, 23.4% in June, 17.8% in July, 14.9% in August and 13.3% in September.   This deceleration will probably show up in Case-Shiller and the FHFA indexes very soon.

The graph shows existing home sales by month for 2020 and 2021.
This was the second month this year with sales down year-over-year. This should continue through the rest of the year, since sales averaged 6.7million SAAR over the last three months of 2020.  emphasis added

Existing-home sales rebounded in September after seeing sales wane the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors®.

From a year-over-year timeframe, one region held steady while the three others each reported a decline in sales.
  
Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, rose 7.0% from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.29 million in September. However, sales decreased 2.3% from a year ago (6.44 million in September 2020).

도시재생의 성공적인 사례와 방법론이 넘치는 가운데 사업이 종료된 이후의 지속가능성을 고민하고 해결책을 제시한 책이 나왔다. 도시재생 현장에서 현실적인 문제를 접해온 저자들이 도시재생사업이 종료된 이후에도 지역경제를 이끌어갈 방법을 모색한 책이다. 저자들은 재개발, 개건축과는 달리 쇠퇴한 지역을 주민들이 주도해 문제를 해결하고 경제 활성화를 달성하기 위해 도시재생기업에 주목한다.

도시재생기업은 사회적기업, 마을기업, 협동조합 등의 이름으로 지원사업이나 공모사업을 통해 문을 열었다. 하지만 비즈니스에 대한 이해나 교육, 아이템의 부족 등 사업 지속성에 한계를 겪고 어려움에 처해 있는 조직이 많다. 저자들은 지속가능한 도시재생을 한 단계 끌어올릴 지역경제 비즈니스 모델을 제시한다.

제1편 도시재생의 이해
제1장 도시재생을 알아보자
도시는 혼자 살아갈 수 없다 | 서울은 어떻게 지금의 모습을 갖추었을까? | 도시재생은 어떻게 시작되었을까? | 도시재생을 하면 무엇이 좋아질까? | 어떻게 하면 도시재생이 지속될 수 있을까?

제2편 도시재생경제조직의 사업화(지역공동체조직의 사업화)
제1장 도시재생경제조직을 파악하자
시작하는 이유를 명확히 하자 | 열정과 행동을 구체화하자 | 사업화는 지역팀이 중심이다 | 방향과 신뢰가 중요하다

                    <span>On 19 October 2021, the European Commission adopted a Communication relaunching the public consultation on the EU’s economic governance framework. This consultation had been put on hold in March 2020 in order to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic. The Commission communication assesses the implications of the changed circumstances for economic governance following the COVID-19 crisis and sets out additional questions for the public debate. All stakeholders are invited to engage in the debate, which must be wide-ranging and inclusive to build a consensus on the way forward well in time for 2023.</span>

                    <span>Economic downturns are not as unpredictable as we once thought. There is mounting evidence that the expectations of consumers, workers and employers predict economic downturns, sometimes 12 to 18 months ahead. But we live in exceptional times. The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have sown doubt and uncertainty among consumers and producers and may do so for some time to come. So what’s the economic prognosis? this column argues that expectations data for the US suggest the country is entering recession about now.</span>

 Excerpt: 
From the Rhode Island Association of Realtors®
“The single-family home market has been incredibly competitive and the properties that are available for sale are put under contract so quickly, that it appears some prospective buyers took a break. Also, the spread of the delta variant affected the market last quarter, keeping some buyers at home and making some prospective sellers think twice about listing their home,” said Leann D’Ettore, President of the Rhode Island Association of Realtors.

Economic activity grew at a modest to moderate rate, according to the majority of Federal Reserve Districts. Several Districts noted, however, that the pace of growth slowed this period, constrained by supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and uncertainty around the Delta variant of COVID-19. A majority of Districts indicated positive growth in consumer spending; however, auto sales were widely reported as declining due to low inventory levels and rising prices.

                    <span>Changes in contract labour regulation were introduced in India in the late 1940s. The hope was that controlling whether firms could downsize would reduce mass job losses as large British companies left the country post-independence. This column explores the effect of the Industrial Disputes Act on firms of different sizes. The authors find that smaller firms did not see much change, but larger firms did employ fewer contract workers as a result. However, this effect was driven by firms exploiting a loophole, rather than the law itself.</span>

                    <span>From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million in September, up 5.4% from August’s preliminary pace but down 3.7% from last September’s seasonally adjusted pace
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that the YOY % decline in the inventory of existing homes for sale last month was similar to that in August.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 12.6% from last September.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release September existing home sales on Thursday, October 21, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 6.06 million SAAR. 

Note that the NAR reported median prices were up 23.6% Year-over-year (YoY) in May, 23.4% in June, 17.8% in July and 14.9% in August.  It appears the YoY growth slowed further in September.</span>

Excerpt: 
Census will release data next year on the length of time from start to completion, and that will probably show long delays in 2021. In 2020, it took an average of 6.8 months from start to completion for single family homes, and 15.4 months for buildings with 2 or more units.
Combined, there are 1.426 million units under construction. This is the most since 1974.

                    <span>From the Census Bureau: Permits, Starts and Completions
Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,555,000.  This is 1.6 percent below the revised August estimate of 1,580,000, but is 7.4 percent above the September 2020 rate of 1,448,000.  Single‐family housing starts in September were at a rate of 1,080,000; this is virtually unchanged from the revised August figure of 1,080,000. The September rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 467,000.
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,589,000.  This is 7.7 percent below the revised August rate of 1,721,000, but is virtually  unchanged from the September 2020 rate of 1,589,000.  Single‐family authorizations in September were at a rate of 1,041,000; this is 0.9 percent below the revised August figure of 1,050,000.  Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 498,000 in September

The first graph shows single and multi-family housing starts for the last several years.
Multi-family starts (blue, 2+ units) decreased in September compared to August.   Multi-family starts were up 38% year-over-year in September.
Single-family starts (red) were unchanged in September, and were down 2% year-over-year.   
The second graph shows single and multi-family housing starts since 1968. 
This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and then the eventual recovery (but still not historically high).
Total housing starts in September were below expectations, and starts in July and August were revised down, combined.

부동산 시장이 유례없는 대변혁의 시기를 맞고 있다. 코로나 바이러스의 유행으로 경기는 안 좋은데 집값과 전월세는 폭등하고, 상가 건물이 비어가는 와중 꼬마빌딩의 인기는 치솟고 있다. 영끌해서라도 내 집을 마련하려는 사람들, 서울에서 수도권으로 밀려나는 사람들에, 벼락부자가 된 사람들까지 뒤섞여 부동산 시장은 혼돈 그 자체다. 기존의 경험과 상식으로는 이해하기 힘든 상황에 사람들은 그야말로 ‘패닉’에 빠졌다. 

이런 대전환의 시기를 맞아 부동산 업계가 가장 신뢰하는 전문가인 김경민 서울대 교수가 ‘2022년 대한민국 부동산 시장에 대한 완벽한 해설서’를 제시한다. 빅데이터로 예측한 서울시 아파트 가격부터 코로나 이후 떠오를 핫 플레이스와 최신 투자 정보까지, 지금 반드시 주목해야 할 부동산 트렌드에 대해 상세히 분석했다. 저자는 신간 《부동산 트렌드 2022》에서 특히 2022년에는 대선과 지방선거, 금리 인상과 대출 절벽 같은 이슈가 쟁점이 되어 또 한 번 부동산 시장이 요동칠 거라 단언한다.

하버드대학교 부동산·도시계획 연구로 박사 학위를 받은 김경민 서울대 교수는, 수많은 부동산 투자자와 실수요자의 든든한 안내자 역할을 해왔다. 《부동산 트렌드 2022》는 현재 대한민국의 주요한 부동산 이슈를 총망라한 결정판이다. 책에 활용된 데이터 분석기법은 저자가 보스턴 소재 상업용 부동산…</span>

ELS 발행자의 운용 전략에 관한 내용을 다룬다. ELS 발행자의 손익은 주가와 무관하며 변동성에 의존한다. 하지만 이런 변동성은 하나의 숫자가 아닌 스큐를 갖는 곡면이다. 스큐를 갖는 변동성이 필요한 이유와 이를 이용한 그릭 계산 방법과 배당 효과를 설명한다.

부모처럼 살기 싫지만 부모만큼 되기도 어려운 세대, 밀레니얼. 그들은 ‘이번 생은 망했다’면서도 탈진 직전까지 일에 몰두하고, 필패하도록 설계된 체제에서 ‘졌지만 잘 싸웠다’며 자조한다. 밀레니얼 세대에게 ‘번아웃’은 신드롬이 아니다. 무기력과 불안정은 그들 삶 전반에 깔린 배경음악이자, 그들이 평생을 지내며 살아온 온도다. 

미국 유명 온라인 매체 에서 700만 조회 수를 기록하며 국내 트위터상에서도 크게 회자한 칼럼 ‘밀레니얼은 어떻게 번아웃 세대가 되었는가’의 저자 앤 헬렌 피터슨은, 번아웃에 휩싸인 밀레니얼에게 결연히 선언한다. “반드시 이렇게 살 필요는 없다.” 더불어 그들이 겪은 실패와 좌절을 시대순으로 면밀히 살피며, 이 문제들이 사실은 예외주의와 능력주의를 기반으로 한 현대 자본주의 체제에서 비롯한 것이라고 분석한다. 아마존, 〈하퍼스 바자〉, 〈뉴욕 타임스〉, 〈에스콰이어〉에서 2020년 화제의 논픽션으로 손꼽힌 책 《요즘 애들》은 열정과 능력을 의심받으면서도 부단히 성실해야 하는 밀레니얼의 악전고투를 가감 없이 담아냈다.

                    <span>Central banks around the world are weighing the pros and cons of issuing their own digital currency. This column identifies open research questions around the international macro-financial dimension of central bank digital currencies, including what is different about them, and what the implications for international central bank cooperation are. Addressing these questions would not only push the frontier of knowledge, it would also provide the conceptual backbone and evidence that could usefully inform future policy decisions on CBDCs.</span>

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of October 15th, inventory was at 424 thousand (7 day average), compared to 554 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.6%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55% from 936 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 426 thousand, and was down 23.3% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 38% above the record low in early April.


Now inventory may have peaked for the year in early September.   Six weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far), so inventory is currently off about 3.1% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for October.</span>

Strong consumer demand helped push builder confidence higher in October despite growing affordability challenges stemming from rising material prices and shortages. Builder sentiment in the market for newly built single-family homes moved four points higher to 80 in October, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.

                    <span>From the Fed: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production fell 1.3 percent in September after moving down 0.1 percent in August; output was previously reported to have risen 0.4 percent in August. In September, manufacturing output decreased 0.7 percent: The production of motor vehicles and parts fell 7.2 percent, as shortages of semiconductors continued to hobble operations, while factory output elsewhere declined 0.3 percent. The output of utilities dropped 3.6 percent, as demand for cooling subsided after a warmer-than-usual August. Mining production fell 2.3 percent.
The lingering effects of Hurricane Ida more than accounted for the drop in mining in September; they also contributed 0.3 percentage point to the drop in manufacturing. Overall, about 0.6 percentage point of the drop in total industrial production resulted from the impact of the hurricane.
Despite the decrease in September, total industrial production rose 4.3 percent at an annual rate for the third quarter as a whole, its fifth consecutive quarter with a gain of at least 4 percent.
At 100.0 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production in September was 4.6 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector fell 1.0 percentage point in September to 75.2 percent, a rate that is 4.4 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

비경제학자가 말하는 경제학 바이블. ‘효용’이라는 관점에서 공익과 사익을 보는 방법과 문제점 그리고 한계점에 대해 말한다. ‘효용’이란 무엇인가에 대한 정의부터 ‘저효용’ 시대의 어두움과 ‘고효용’ 시대로 가기 위한 논의들까지, ‘경제’를 어려워하는 사람들도 편히 접근하여 쉽게 읽을 수 있도록 최대한 전문용어를 배제하고 중립적, 객관적으로 한국의 경제에 대해 저술하였다. 세상의 흐름을 읽고 올바르게 분석하기 위한 초석을 다진다.

글로벌 팬데믹은 블랙 스완처럼 전 세계인들의 생활 양식을 송두리째 바꾸어놓고 있다. 가까운 미래의 조심스러운 전망도 방역 단계에 따라 춤을 춘다. 예측이 힘든 시대, 그럼에도 불구하고 대중 소비자들의 태도(attitude)에 주목했다. 《2022 트렌드 모니터》는 2022년 변화의 핵심 키워드를 “강력한 영향력을 원하는 ‘슈퍼 개인’의 등장, 그리고 ‘일상적 통제 욕구의 확장’”으로 분석했다. 

끝이 요원해 보이는 팬데믹 상황에서 이 상황을 바꿀 수 없다고 인식한 사람들은 자신의 ‘태도’를 바꾸고 있다. 2022년 대중 소비자들은 막연한 불안감은 줄이고, 앞으로 어떤 변화가 있을지 궁금해하면서, 현재의 만족을 늦추고, 미래에 투자하려고 한다. 코로나19가 끝날 날을 막연히 기대하며 위시리스트를 적는 대신, 짠테크로 절약하고 다양한 방식으로 미래 가치에 투자한다. 불확실한 미래를 준비하기 위해 ‘현재의 만족을 지연(遲延)’시키고 있는 것이다.

이와 동시에 주변 환경과 일상, 사회와 정책 이슈에까지 광범위하게 개입하면서 ‘개인의 통제력’을 확대하려 하고 있다. 대중은 파편화되어 있으면서도, 강력한 영향력을 원하는 ‘슈퍼 개인’이 되려고 하는 듯 보인다. 하지만 ‘답답한’ 상황은 변하지 않는다(2021년 자주 경험하는 감정 1순위–답답하다). 개인은 점점 더 고립되어 가고, 소비…</span>

프로그래밍 경험이 전혀 없는 초보자도 C 프로그래밍의 기초를 빠르게 익힐 수 있도록 구성되어 있다. 풍부한 일러스트와 친절한 설명을 통해 기초부터 차근차근 다지고, 많은 예제 프로그램을 통해 C 언어를 확실히 익히면서 프로그래밍이 무엇인지 체험할 수 있다. 각 장의 마지막에는 요약과 연습문제로 배운 내용을 다시 한번 확인할 수 있도록 구성되었다. 이번 개정판에는 프로그래밍을 할 때 필요한 통합개발환경인 Microsoft Visual Studio의 사용법과 C 언어의 새로운 사양과 기능들이 추가되었다.

                    <span>Policy rates in advanced economies are unusually low. This phenomenon has competing effects: low rates harm bank profits by squeezing interest margins, but also boost the value of long-term assets held by banks. Using a standard banking model, this column determines the policy rate level at which these two forces cancel out, or the ‘tipping point’. Past this tipping point, the net effect of low rates on bank capital is negative. Applying the model to the US economy, the tipping point in August 2007 is estimated as a policy rate of 0.55%.</span>

                    <span>In many settings, independent decision makers employed to make determinations in disputes or contests between parties can be subject to public pressure  This column examines the extent to which crowd pressure affects referees’ decisions in Germany’s top football division, exploiting the introduction of video technology as well as the absence of crowds during the Covid-19 pandemic. It finds no evidence of bias in awarding goals or penalties, but a tendency for bias towards the home team when deciding whether or not to issue a yellow card, which disappears in the absence of a crowd.</span>

삼성그룹 이건희 회장이 타계한지 꼭 1년(10월 25일)이 되었다. 이 책은 고인의 1주기를 맞아 고인과 가까이에서 일했던 전직 삼성맨들을 포함한 다양한 사람들의 생생한 증언을 중심으로 하면서 고인이 남긴 에세이집 ‘생각 좀 하며 세상을 보자’를 부분 발췌해 고인의 사상과 철학을 담았다.

이건희 회장은 기업인이었지만 시대를 앞서 읽은 예언자였으며, 이 힘든 세상을 어떻게 헤쳐가야 할지 지혜를 말해준 사상가였다. 지금까지 이건희 회장을 다룬 많은 책은 오직 그의 리더십과 기업 경영 능력을 다루는 쪽에 국한된 측면이 있다. 그러나 허문명 기자가 전직 삼성맨들의 증언, 고인이 남긴 글과 자료 등을 통해 입체적으로 완성해낸 이 책은 기업인이 아닌 사상가로서의 인간 이건희를 본격 조명한다. 책을 읽다보면 지금은 만날 수 없는 고인의 생각과 삶이 생생하게 느껴진다.

주식에 뛰어든 ‘주린이’들은 각종 전문 용어에 어려워하기 마련이다. D램, 양극재, 전해질, 팹리스 등, 전공자들에게는 기본 상식 수준의 내용이지만, 일상에서는 접하기 어려운 단어들! 주식투자를 꼭 하고 싶지만, 상장사에 대한, 그리고 그 상장사가 속한 산업에 대한 지식이 없는 채 투자를 하는 것은 얼마나 위험한 일인가? 이런 ‘주린이’들을 위해 18년 동안 산업현장을 직접 뛰어다녔던 현직기자인 강경래 작가가 직접 책을 내게 되었다.

강경래 기자는 [강경래의 인더스트리] 연재를 통해 산업에 대한 기초적인 지식과 상식을 전달해주었고, 많은 이들에게 긍정적인 반응을 얻었다. 그리고 조금 더 많은 이들에게 이러한 지식을 전달하고자, ‘주식투자에 꼭 필요한’ 산업 이야기들을 책으로 출간하게 되었다.

인터넷은 혁명을 불러올 것으로 기대되었다. 권위에 저항하고 권력을 무너뜨리고 문화뿐 아니라 정치의 영역에서도 민주화를 확산시킬 것이라 믿어졌다. 하지만 인터넷은 다른 방향으로 흘러가기 시작했다. 군사적 필요에서 등장했고, 국가적 기반을 통해 전파된 인터넷은 어쩌면 처음부터 중립적인 도구가 아니었을지도 모른다. 인터넷 시대를 맞아 몇몇 새로운 기업이 등장했지만, 이들 역시 인터넷이라는 구조가 만들어놓은 철로를 따라 움직이는 기차일 뿐이다. 

인터넷은 원래부터 권력과 지배력과 돈을 가지고 있던 사람들에게 더 많은 권력과 지배력과 돈을 안겨주었다. 인터넷과 인터넷이 작동하는 방식은 소수의 신념과 동기와 이해에 따라 결정되었다. 인터넷의 진짜 구조를 들여다보면 현대 세계를 움직이는 거대한 권력이 드러난다. 

현대 사회를 지배하고 있는 인터넷 기술과 문화를 통해 과거와 현재를 진단하는 이 책은 수면 아래 감춰진 인터넷의 진짜 구조를 파헤친다. 1부에서 저자는 인터넷을 만든 사람과 연결하는 사람, 관리하는 사람을 만난다. 이들은 인터넷이라는 시스템의 탄생과 유지에 기여하는 사람들이다. 

2부에서는 인터넷으로 가장 큰 이익을 얻는 집단인, 투자자와 광고업자를 다룬다. 세계적인 영향력을 행사하는 것으로 보이는 첨단 기술기업일지라도 중요한 결정권은 모두 투자자들에게 있음을 보게 될 것이다. 3부는 인터넷에서 벌어지는 전쟁을 다룬다. 인터넷은 문화적 영향력을 겨루는 전선이자, 강대국들의 전장이다. 국가와 기업, 시민단체, 개인이 뒤엉켜 전선은 광범위하게 펼쳐진다.

소유권의 시대는 막을 내리고 접속의 시대가 열리면서 구독경제가 화두다. 2020년 초부터 시작한 코로나19의 확산과 함께 구독모델이 급성장하여 의식주를 포함한 모든 영역으로 확산되고 있으며, 심지어 차량까지 이어지고 있다. 

영상, 출판, 음악, 게임 등 미디어 업계도 예외는 아니다. 플랫폼 구독모델을 갖고 있는 대표적인 미디어 기업으로 넷플릭스, 아마존 프라임, 뉴욕타임스, 서브스택, 스포티파이, 만타 코믹스, 카카오구독ON, 애플 아케이드 등이 있다. 이들은 어떠한 전략을 갖고 비즈니스 모델을 이룩했으며 미래 전망은 어떨까?

우리는 사회에 나오는 순간 금융의 세계를 만난다. 근로계약서를 작성하고 월급을 받아 세금을 내고, 신용카드로 물건을 산다. 월급의 일부를 저축하고, 돈이 없으면 대출을 받으며, 다치면 보험처리를 한다. 일상에서 숨 쉬듯 이루어지는 모든 활동이 ‘금융 생활’이다.

이 책은 언젠가 우리가 마주하게 될 ‘금융의 세계’를 낮은 시선으로 알려준다. 본문 내용이 누군가에게는 상식이고 누군가에게는 세상 쉬운 정보일 수도 있다. 하지만 책의 제목처럼 다른 사람은 아는 것을 나만 모르는 것 같아 ‘물어보기 부끄러워 묻지 못한’ 사람도 분명 존재할 것이다. 이들이 앞으로 살아가며 마주하게 될 돈과 관련된 상황에서 조금이나마 도움이 되길 바란다.

주식시장을 강타하는 주가폭락은 월가의 투자가들에게도 두려움의 대상이다. 공포심을 자극하는 각종 기사와 보고서가 쏟아지고 투매가 벌어진다. 이런 상황에서 이성적으로 투자 결정을 내리기란 무척 어렵다. 원칙 없는 감정적인 대처 때문에 막대한 손실을 입기도 한다. 

크로스비는 이처럼 주식투자의 성공과 실패를 가르는 열쇠가 판단력을 흐리는 심리적 요인에 있음을 밝히고, 심리적 요인을 통제해 수익을 극대화하는 성공적인 투자법을 연구했다. 행동투자의 선구자인 그의 글과 강연은 월가의 투자가들이 더 나은 투자 결정을 내리는 통찰의 원천이 되고 있다. 

이 책 《시장을 이기는 부의 심리학》은 출간 당시 일반 투자자들뿐만 아니라 수많은 펀드 매니저, 투자 컨설턴트에게 찬사를 받은 크로스비의 대표 저작이다. 중요한 상황에 직면했을 때 과도한 시도를 추구하는 경향인 행동편향이 어떻게 투자 성과를 망치는지 보여주고, 대안적 투자 기법으로 규칙 기반의 행동 투자 모델(RIB)을 제시한다. 

저자는 감정적인 투자자가 흥분 상태에서 주식을 너무 비싸게 매수하고 절망적인 상태에서 너무 싸게 매도할 수 있다고 지적한다. 또한 지나친 걱정 때문에 시장의 혼란이 큰 수익의 전조가 될 수 있음에도, 그 시점을 인지하는 데 실패한다고 말한다. 자기 자신의 심리상태가 성공 투자의 걸림돌이 되는 것이다.

한 주에도 몇 개씩 쏟아져 나오는 신조어, 신상품, 새로운 매체를 좇는 대신 생활변화의 흐름을 이해하는 오늘날의 시대감성을 제시한다. 완벽함보다는 노력형, 예쁨보다는 멋짐으로 대변되는 시대감성과 지루한 일상을 콘텐츠로 승화하는 이들의 이야기가 펼쳐진다. 또한 주가가 오르고 내리듯 시세와 차트를 만드는 디지털 밈, 하이퍼리얼리즘과 메타버스 등, 한 번쯤 들어봤지만 정확하게 이해하지는 못했던 오늘의 문화코드에 대해서도 알 수 있을 것이다. 

새로운 세대가 궁금한가? ‘요즘 애들은 어떤 애들이야?’, ‘뭐 하고 놀아?’라는 막연한 질문으로는 답을 얻을 수 없다. 그럴수록 점점 시대감성에서 동떨어진 존재가 될 뿐이다. 그들이 남긴 흔적과 데이터가 담고 있는 스토리를 보아야 한다. 그 속에서 탄생하는 문화를 보고, 새로운 시대가 요청하는 것에 행보를 맞춰야 한다. 도표와 이야기로 풀어가는 2022년의 미래상을 따라감으로써, 무엇이든 잊히기 쉬운 이 시대에 기억되는 사람, 기억되는 브랜드가 되는 힌트를 얻을 수 있을 것이다.

16가지의 키워드를 통해 위드 코로나 시대에 접어들면서 달라진 라이프스타일의 변화 방향성을 탐색하고, 디지털 기반으로 변화되는 시대상과 마케팅에 대한 속 깊은 이야기를 들려준다. 

이 책은 글로벌 광고마케팅 회사 이노션 인사이트그룹에서 근무하는 16인의 컨설턴트가 치열한 분석 끝에 내놓은 특별한 보고서로, 그저 변화하는 현상의 나열이 아닌 변화의 원인과 그 변화가 궁극적으로 가져올 마케팅 커뮤니케이션에서의 시사점과 활용 가치에 주안점을 둔다. 나아가 위드 코로나 시대의 일상과 놀이문화, 각종 제도적 변화로 인해 달라질 세상의 모습, 사회문화적 환경 변화 속에서의 마케팅 이슈들에 대해 치열하게 고민한 결과물을 담았다. 

또한 이 책에는 어디에서도 볼 수 없는 ‘스페셜 리포트’가 수록됐는데, 이는 소비자 행동과 브랜드에 대한 태도, 마케팅 환경의 급격한 변화에도 불구하고 기존 방식으로 분석한 지수들에 의존한다는 비판적 시선에서 탄생한 것으로, 앞으로 주목받을 ‘쿨한’ 브랜드에 대해 심층적으로 분석한 내용을 선보인다. 

이 책에는 마케팅 환경의 변화와 브랜드가 가진 고민을 가장 가까이에서 체감하는 광고대행사의 마케팅 커뮤니케이션 전문가들이 현장에서 겪은 경험이 생생하게 담겨 있다. 각종 행사나 회의가 온라인으로 대체되고 사람들끼리 한 공간에서 이야기하기도 힘든 위드 코로나 …</span>

명강사가 알려주는 입문자가 알아야 하는 탄탄한 R 데이터 분석 기본기. 저자는 패스트캠퍼스/러닝스픈즈/멀티캠퍼스를 비롯해 유수의 기업에서 데이터 분석 강의를 진행한 명강사다. 강의를 하며 1. 수강생은 바쁘다 2. 바쁘다는 이유로 자료 구조를 건너뛰고 무작정 데이터 분석부터 배우면 3. 데이터 분석을 제대로 익히지 못한다는 사실을 알아냈다. 

그래서 이 책을 준비했다. 1. 한 권으로 2. 특히 데이터 분석 핵심인 자료 구조를 자유자재로 다룰 수 있게 중점적으로 설명하고 3. 데이터 분석 전과정을 체험하게 구성했다. 단순히 명령어 사용법만 안다고 데이터 분석을 할 수는 없다. 실제 현장에서 만나게 되는 다양한 경우에 맞춰 활용하는 방법을 알아야 한다. 17년간 데이터 분석가로, 3년간 강사로 활약한 저자가 제시하는 학습 방법을 따라 책에 담긴 데이터 분석 노하우도 모두 챙겨가보자.

전국을 뒤덮던 ‘도시재생사업’이 마무리되었거나 종료를 앞두고 있다. 그간 막대한 예산이 투입된 지원사업임에도 불구하고 현장에서는 지원이 종료된 이후의 지속가능성을 두고 고심이 깊다. 그럼 지원사업이 종료되더라도 지역에서 발생하는 다양한 문제를 해결하며 유지, 관리해 갈 방법은 무엇인가. 

주민들이 지역자원을 발굴하고 창업과 일자리를 창출해 지역경제를 활성화하는 도시재생기업이 그 해결책으로 주목받고 있다. 하지만 창업과 일자리 창출은 수많은 변수로 리크스가 크고 두서없이 시작했다가 거듭된 실패로 포기가 속출하는 쉽지 않은 도전이다. 따라서 주민의 창업 성공률을 높이고 기업을 안정궤도에 안착시킬 도구가 필요하다. 도시재생기업을 운영할 주민들의 역량을 강화할 도구로 이 개발되었다.

                    <span>The transition to electric cars may be the next step in the fight against climate change. But a simple ban on gasoline car sales would be a mistake, says Stephen Holland, whose paper appeared in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy. We spoke with him about why and what should be done instead.</span>

서학개미를 위한 미국 주식 퀀트투자 입문+실습서이다. 퀀트투자는 수학적, 통계적 기법을 활용해 투자 종목을 발굴하는 투자 방법이다. 퀀트투자 전략을 만들기 위해서는 유명한 전략들이 어떻게 만들어졌는지 개념을 이해하고, 어떻게 구현됐는지 기본기를 따라 하며 배워야 한다. 다만 투자 대가들의 전략을 소개한 책은 쉽게 찾아볼 수 있지만, 그 전략을 구현한 기술적인 방법을 담은 책은 매우 찾아보기 어렵다. 또한 퀀트투자 전략을 공부하기 위해서는 코딩이나 수학 등 부가적인 배경지식이 필요하다. 

이 책은 이미 잘 알려진 투자 대가들의 전략을 소개하고 자신의 컴퓨터에서 이 전략을 구현해보며 응용하는 방법을 알려준다. 책을 따라 미국 주식 퀀트투자 과정을 배우고 나면 자신만의 투자 전략을 스스로 개발할 수 있을 것이다.

                    <span>Immigration has been a central political debate in the United States for decades, in part because of public concerns about its magnitude and its composition. For example, in the early 2000s, around 1.25 million immigrants arrived each year (Card, 2009). The share of immigrants in the US working-age population increased from 10% in 1990 to […]
