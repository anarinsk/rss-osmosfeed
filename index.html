This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of September 17th, inventory was at 436 thousand (7 day average), compared to 573 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.8%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55%.


A week ago, inventory was at 431 thousand, and was down 25.5% YoY.   Two weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far).


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed, but may be peaking for the year.   Inventory was about 42.4% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of 158 thousand, or about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we&#x27;d normally expect, however inventory has increased 130 thousand (almost normal).


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for August.</span>

From the NAHB: Builder Confidence Steadies as Material and Labor Challenges Persist
Builder confidence inched up in September on lower lumber prices and strong housing demand, even as the housing sector continues to grapple with building material supply chain issues and labor challenges. Ending a three-month decline, builder sentiment in the market for newly built single-family homes edged up one point to 76 in September, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.

                    <span>Unemployment rates differ widely across local labor markets. I offer new empirical evidence that high local unemployment emerges because of elevated local job losing rates. Local employers, rather than local workers, account for most of spatial gaps in job stability. I then propose a theory in which spatial differences in job loss arise endogenously, due to the spatial sorting of heterogeneous employers across local labor markets.  Labor market frictions induce productive employers to over-value locating close to each other. The optimal policy incentivizes them to relocate to areas with high job losing rates, providing a rationale for commonly used place-based policies. I estimate the model using French administrative data. The estimated model accounts for over three fourths of the cross-sectional dispersion in unemployment rates, as well as for the respective contributions of job losing and job finding rates. Employers&#x27; inefficient location choices amplify spatial unemployment differentials five-fold. Both real-world and optimal place-based policies can yield sizable local and aggregate welfare gains.</span>

                    <span>Two-year community colleges enroll nearly half of all first-time undergraduates in the United States, but to ambiguous effect: low persistence rates and the potential for diverting students from 4-year institutions cast ambiguity over 2-year colleges&#x27; contributions to upward mobility. This paper develops a new instrumental variables approach to identifying causal effects along multiple treatment margins, and applies it to linked education and earnings registries to disentangle the net impacts of 2-year college access into two competing causal margins: significant value-added for 2-year entrants who otherwise would not have attended college, but negative impacts on students diverted from immediate 4-year entry.</span>

                    <span>We conduct a laboratory experiment to study a decentralized market where goods are differentiated and evaluations are private. We implement different semi-structured bargaining protocols based on deferred acceptance, and we compare their performance to the benchmark scenario of a sealed-bid auction. We show that bargaining dramatically improves efficiency, mainly to the benefit of players rather than the silent auctioneer. A protocol of unconstrained simultaneous bargaining performs best, doubling the proportion of deals relative to the benchmark. This is because participants seek to reveal information through a gradual bidding-up strategy that favors bargaining environments. Aggregate efficiency nonetheless suffers from the fact that buyers bargain harder than sellers, and that some players over-bargain to appropriate a larger share of the unknown surplus.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic drastically disrupted the functioning of U.S. public schools, potentially changing the relative appeal of alternatives such as homeschooling and private schools. Using longitudinal student-level administrative data from Michigan and nationally representative data from the Census Household Pulse Survey, we show how the pandemic affected families’ choices of school sector. We document four central facts. First, public school enrollment declined noticeably in fall 2020, with about 3 percent of Michigan students and 10 percent of kindergartners using other options. Second, most of this was driven by homeschooling rates jumping substantially, driven largely by families with children in elementary school. Third, homeschooling increased more where schools provided in-person instruction while private schooling increased more where instruction was remote, suggesting heterogeneity in parental concerns about children’s physical health and instructional quality. Fourth, kindergarten declines were highest among low income and Black families while declines in other grades were highest among higher income and White families, highlighting important heterogeneity by students’ existing attachment to public schools. Our results shed light on how families make schooling decisions and imply potential longer-run disruptions to public schools in the form of decreased enrollment and funding, changed composition of the student body, and increased size of the next kindergarten cohort.</span>

We build and estimate an equilibrium model in which a borrower may signal her default risk through the reserve interest rate. Comparing a market with and without signaling relative to the benchmark with no asymmetric information, we find that adverse selection destroys as much as 34% of total surplus, up to 78% of which can be restored with signaling. We also estimate backward-bending supply curves for some markets, consistent with the prediction of Stiglitz &amp; Weiss (1981).</span>

                    <span>Students who attend different colleges in the U.S. end up with vastly different economic outcomes. We study the role of relative value-added across colleges within student choice sets in producing these outcome disparities. Linking high school, college, and earnings registries spanning the state of Texas, we identify relative college value-added by comparing the outcomes of students who apply to and are admitted by the same set of institutions, as this approach strikingly balances observable student potential across college treatments and renders our extensive set of covariates irrelevant as controls. Methodologically, we develop a framework for identifying and interpreting value-added under varying assumptions about match effects and sorting gains. Empirically, we estimate a relatively tight, though non-degenerate, distribution of relative value-added across the wide diversity of Texas public universities. Selectivity poorly predicts value-added within student choice sets, with only a fleeting selectivity earnings premium fading to zero after a few years in the labor market. Non-peer college inputs like instructional spending more strongly predict value-added, especially conditional on selectivity. Colleges that boost BA completion, especially in STEM majors, also tend to boost earnings. Finally, we probe the potential for (mis)match effects by allowing value-added schedules to vary by student characteristics.</span>

                    <span>This paper advances the use of pre-analysis plans in non-experimental research settings. In a study of recent minimum wage changes, we demonstrate how analyses of medium- and long-run impacts of policy interventions can be pre-specified as extensions to short-run analyses. Further, our pre-analysis plan includes comparisons of the effects of large vs. small minimum wage increases, which is a theoretically motivated dimension of heterogeneity. We discuss how these use cases harness the strengths of pre-analysis plans while mitigating their weaknesses. This project’s initial analyses explored CPS and ACS data from 2011 through 2015. Alongside these analyses, we pre-committed to analyses incorporating CPS and ACS data extending through 2019. Averaging across the specifications in our pre-analysis plan, we estimate that relatively large minimum wage increases reduced employment rates among low-skilled individuals by just over 2.5 percentage points. Our estimates of the effects of relatively small minimum wage increases vary across data sets and specifications but are, on average, both economically and statistically indistinguishable from zero. We estimate that medium-run effects exceed short-run effects and that the elasticity of employment with respect to the minimum wage is substantially more negative for large minimum wage increases than for small increases.</span>

                    <span>We examine the effects WWII Lanham Act Nursery Schools (LNS) on high school and young adult educational and labor outcomes of participants in the landmark Project Talent (PT) study. All PT places that received funding for LNS schools and all PT places that did not were identified by examining program records and contemporaneous newspaper accounts. Focusing on students who in 1960 attended high school in the same city or town where they were born, we estimate intent to treat effects of access to LNS preschool on high school academic and social emotional outcomes and on educational attainment and labor outcomes at five and eleven years following high school graduation. Preschool boosts high school academic outcomes for men and (in at least one specification) income 11 years after high school graduation. For women, preschool exposure had a negative effect on some social emotional outcomes in high school. We found no or inconsistent effects for other outcomes. The Lanham experience demonstrates that even with the less sophisticated understanding of child development of the early 1940s, the first universal, government-funded preschool program had positive impacts on boys’ outcomes at least through high school. Given today’s expanded understanding of child development and focus on the quality of early care and education programming, these findings provide some optimism as communities, states, and the federal government contemplate expanding funding for today’s early learning environments.</span>

                    <span>Information asymmetries are known in theory to lead to inefficiently low credit provision, yet empirical estimates of the resulting welfare losses are scarce. This paper leverages a randomized experiment conducted by a large fintech lender to estimate welfare losses arising from asymmetric information in the market for online consumer credit. Building on methods from the insurance literature, we show how exogenous variation in interest rates can be used to estimate borrower demand and lender cost curves and recover implied welfare losses. While asymmetric information generates large equilibrium price distortions, we find only small overall welfare losses, particularly for high-credit-score borrowers.</span>

                    <span>Corporate science in America emerged in the interwar period, as some companies set up state-of-the-art corporate laboratories, hired trained scientists, and embarked upon basic research of the kind we would associate today with academic institutions. Using a newly assembled dataset on U.S. companies between 1926 and 1940 combining information on corporate ownership, organization, research and innovation, we attempt to explain the rise of corporate research. We argue that it was driven by companies trying to take advantage of opportunities for innovation made possible by scientific advances and an underdeveloped academic research system in the United States. Measuring  field-specific scientific backwardness in several different ways, we find that large firms, business group affiliated firms, and firms close to the technological frontier were more likely to initiate scientific  research. We also find that companies in monopolistic or concentrated industries were more likely to  engage in basic research. Corporate research was positively correlated with novel and valuable patents, and with market-to-book ratios. For companies choosing to do so, investment in corporate research seems to have paid off. The results shed light on the link between corporate organization, market structure and corporate science.</span>

                    <span>Existing research has shown that job displacement leads to large and persistent earnings losses for men, but evidence for women is scarce. Using administrative data from Germany, we apply an event study design in combination with propensity score matching and a reweighting technique to directly compare men and women who are displaced from similar jobs and firms. Our results show that after a mass layoff, women’s earnings losses are about 35% higher than men’s, with the gap persisting five years after job displacement. This is partly explained by a higher propensity of women to take up part-time or marginal employment following job loss, but even full-time wage losses are almost 50% (or 5 percentage points) higher for women than for men. We then show that on the household level there is no evidence of an added worker effect, independent of the gender of the job loser. Finally, we document that parenthood magnifies the gender gap sharply: while fathers of young children have smaller earnings losses than men in general, mothers of young children have much larger earnings losses than other women.</span>

                    <span>A generous safety net may improve mental health outcomes and stress-related health behaviors for single mothers by promoting financial security, but stigma and hassle associated with welfare use could offset some of these gains. We use a simulated safety net eligibility approach that accounts for interactions across safety net programs and relies on changing policies across states and time to identify causal effects of safety net generosity on psychological distress and risky behaviors of single mothers. Our results suggest that a more generous safety net is protective of maternal mental health: we estimate that a $1000 increase to the combined cash and food benefit package reduces severe psychological distress by 5.5 percent. Breaking out effects by individual programs while still controlling for potential benefits from other programs, we find that this reduction is entirely due to simulated tax credit eligibility and appears to occur in the first half of the year, when such benefits are typically received. We find no significant effect of the overall safety net on risky behaviors like smoking and heavy drinking, but this masks offsetting effects of cash and food benefits, suggesting that the impact of improved financial resources depends on details of transfer program design.</span>

                    <span>I consider the effect of empathy towards others on the internalization of interpersonal externalities and on private contributions to the provision of public goods. I show that if preferences are empathetic in the sense of depending on the well-being of others, then in an extreme case external effects are fully internalized, and private contributions to the provision of a public good will be sufficient for it to be provided at an efficient level. Furthermore I show that an increase in the level of empathy shown by any agent will lead to an increase in the level of provision of the public good, and that as empathy levels increase towards their upper bound, the level of provision of the public good converges to the efficient level. Under certain conditions an increase in empathy is Pareto improving. As it is well-documented that people display some degree of empathy, it is arguable that our failure to provide public goods at efficient levels is attributable to lack of empathy as well as to the free rider problem.</span>

                    <span>A large body of evidence finds that relative mobility in the US has declined over the past 150 years. However, long-run mobility estimates are usually based on white samples and therefore do not account for the limited opportunities available for non-white families. Moreover, historical data measure the father’s status with error, which biases estimates toward greater mobility. Using linked census data from 1850-1940, I show that accounting for race and measurement error can double estimates of intergenerational persistence. Updated estimates imply that there is greater equality of opportunity today than in the past, mostly because opportunity was never that equal.</span>

                    <span>Does industrial policy work? This is a subject of long-standing debates among economists and policymakers. Using newly digitized microdata, we evaluate the Korean government&#x27;s policy that promoted heavy and chemical industries between 1973 and 1979 by cutting taxes and building new industrial complexes for them. We show that output, input use, and labor productivity of the targeted industries and regions grew significantly faster than those of non-targeted ones. While the plant-level total factor productivity also grew faster in targeted industries and regions, the misallocation of resources within them got significantly worse, especially among the entrants, so that the total factor productivity at the industry-region level did not increase relative to the non-targeted industries and regions. In addition, we provide new evidence on how industrial policy reshapes the economy: (i) The establishment size distribution of targeted industries and regions shifted to the right with thicker tails due to the entry of large establishments and (ii) the targeted industries became more important in the economy&#x27;s input-output structure in the sense that their output multipliers increased significantly more.</span>

                    <span>According to the widely known ‘culture of honor’ hypothesis from social psychology, traditional herding practices are believed to have generated a value system that is conducive to revenge-taking and violence. We test this idea at a global scale using a combination of ethnographic records, historical folklore information, global data on contemporary conflict events, and large-scale surveys. The data show systematic links between traditional herding practices and a culture of honor. First, the culture of pre-industrial societies that relied on animal herding emphasizes violence, punishment, and revenge-taking. Second, contemporary ethnolinguistic groups that historically subsisted more strongly on herding have more frequent and severe conflict today. Third, the contemporary descendants of herders report being more willing to take revenge and punish unfair behavior in the globally representative Global Preferences Survey. In all, the evidence supports the idea that this form of economic subsistence generated a functional psychology that has persisted until today and plays a role in shaping conflict across the globe.</span>

                    <span>Using every major nationally-representative dataset on parental and non-parental care provided to children up to age 6, we quantify differences in American children’s care experiences by socioeconomic status (SES), proxied primarily with maternal education. Increasingly, higher-SES children spend less time with their parents and more time in the care of others. Non-parental care for high-SES children is more likely to be in childcare centers, where average quality is higher, and less likely to be provided by relatives where average quality is lower. Even within types of childcare, higher-SES children tend to receive care of higher measured quality and higher cost. Inequality is evident at home as well: measures of parental enrichment at home, from both self-reports and outside observers, are on average higher for higher-SES children. We also find that parental and non-parental quality is reinforcing: children who receive higher quality non-parental care also tend to receive higher quality parental care. Head Start, one of the largest government care subsidy programs for low-income households, reduces inequality in care provided, but it is mainly limited to older children and to the lowest income households. Our evidence is from the pre-COVID-19 period, and the latest year we examine is 2019.</span>

                    <span>Why is workplace sexual harassment chronically underreported? We hypothesize that employers coerce victims into silence through the threat of a retaliatory firing, and test this theory by estimating whether external shocks that reduce the value of a worker&#x27;s outside options exacerbate underreporting. Under mild assumptions, a rise in the severity of formal complaints is indicative of increased underreporting. Combining this insight with an objective measure of the quality of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), we perform two analyses. First, we assess whether workers report sexual harassment more selectively during recessions, when outside labor market options are limited. We estimate the fraction of sexual harassment charges deemed to have merit by the EEOC increases by 0.5-0.7% for each one percentage point increase in a state-industry&#x27;s monthly unemployment rate. The effect is amplified in industries employing a larger fraction of men and in establishments with a higher share of male managers. Second, we test whether less generous UI benefits create economic incentives for victims of workplace sexual harassment to remain silent. We find the selectivity of sexual harassment charges increases by more than 30% in response to a 50% cut to North Carolina&#x27;s Unemployment Insurance (UI) program following the Great Recession.</span>

                    <span>At the onset of the COVID-19 economic crisis, as in other crisis episodes, the flight to safety was accompanied by a rapid appreciation of “safe haven” currencies. We quantify currency-induced balance sheet effects for total external positions as well as for individual asset classes using new data on the currency composition of cross-border stocks for 48 countries for the first quarter as well as for the full year 2020. We also conduct the stock-flow reconciliation of net international investment positions to measure overall valuation effects. We show that for many countries currency-induced valuation gains mitigated losses that resulted from declining asset prices in the first quarter of 2020. Moreover, for countries with excess capital out flows during this period, the impact on external balance sheet positions was mitigated by valuation gains. This is because, in contrast with past financial crises, many emerging markets did not experience negative external balance sheet effects from their currency depreciation, partly due to currency-induced valuation gains on equity positions offsetting losses on debt positions, partly due to reduced currency mismatch on their external debt positions.</span>

                    <span>People often estimate probabilities, such as the likelihood that an insurable risk will materialize or that an Irish person has red hair, by retrieving experiences from memory. We present a model of this process based on two established regularities of selective recall: similarity and interference. The model accounts for and reconciles a variety of conflicting empirical findings, such as overestimation of unlikely events when these are cued vs. neglect of non-cued ones, the availability heuristic, the representativeness heuristic, as well as over vs. underreaction to information in different situations. The model makes new predictions on how the content of a hypothesis (not just its objective probability) affects probability assessments by shaping the ease of recall. We experimentally evaluate these predictions and find strong experimental support.</span>

                    <span>Using data from all those born in a single week in 1958 in Britain we track the consequences of short pain and chronic pain in mid-life (age 44) on health, wellbeing and labor market outcomes in later life.  We examine data taken at age 50 in 2008, when the Great Recession hit and then five years later at age 55 in 2013.  We find those suffering both short-term and chronic pain at age 44 continue to report pain and poor general health in their 50s.  However, the associations are much stronger for those with chronic pain.  Furthermore, chronic pain at age 44 is associated with a range of poor mental health outcomes, pessimism about the future and joblessness at age 55 whereas short-duration pain at age 44 is not.  Uniquely, we also show that pain experienced in childhood, at ages 11 and 16, reported by a parent and a teacher respectively, collected decades earlier, predicts pain in mid-life, indicating just how persistent pain can be over the life-course.</span>

                    <span>Will COVID-19 end the urban renaissance that many cities have experienced since the 1980s? This essay selectively reviews the copious literature that now exists on the long-term impact of natural disasters. At this point, the long-run resilience of cities to many forms of physical destruction, including bombing, earthquakes and fires, has been well-documented. The destruction of human capital may leave a longer imprint, but cities have persisted through many plagues over the past millennia. By contrast, economic and political shocks, including deindustrialization or the loss of capital city status, can enormously harm an urban area. These facts suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will only significantly alter urban fortunes, if it is accompanied by a major economic shift, such as widespread adoption of remote work, or political shifts that could lead businesses and the wealthy to leave urban areas. The combination of an increased ability to relocate with increased local redistribution or deterioration of local amenity levels or both could recreate some of the key attributes of the urban crisis of the 1970s.</span>

                    <span>Increasing the diversity of policy committees has taken center stage worldwide, but whether and why diverse committees are more effective is still unclear. In a randomized control trial that varies the salience of female and minority representation on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy committee, the FOMC, we test whether diversity affects how Fed information influences consumers’ subjective beliefs. Women and Black respondents form unemployment expectations more in line with FOMC forecasts and trust the Fed more after this intervention. Women are also more likely to acquire Fed-related information when associated with a female official. White men, who are overrepresented on the FOMC, do not react negatively. Heterogeneous taste for diversity can explain these patterns better than homophily. Our results suggest more diverse policy committees are better able to reach underrepresented groups without inducing negative reactions by others, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of policy communication and public trust in the institution.</span>

                    <span>We review the fast-growing work on salience and economic behavior. Psychological research shows that salient stimuli attract human attention “bottom up” due to their high contrast with surroundings, their surprising nature relative to recalled experiences, or their prominence. The Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer (2012, 2013, 2020) models of salience show how bottom up attention can distort economic choice by distracting decision makers from their immediate goals or from certain choice attributes. We show that this approach explains many puzzles: separately treated departures from “rationality” such as probability weighting, menu effects, reference point effects, and framing, emerge as distinct manifestations of the same principle of bottom up attention to salient stimuli. We highlight new predictions and discuss open conceptual questions, as well as potential applications in finance, industrial organization, advertising, and politics.</span>

                    <span>We empirically test whether the Department of Justice (DOJ) engages in ethnic prejudice against Chinese in its prosecutorial decisions under the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996. Using data of EEA cases from November 1996 to June 2021, we conduct Becker&#x27;s outcome test for evidence of ethnic prejudice. We find that Chinese-named defendants were more likely to be dismissed by trial or acquitted by jury, and were found guilty on fewer counts, and on average received harsher indictments. These results are robust regardless of whether we consider all cases or only arguably &#x60;&#x60;marginal&#x27;&#x27; cases. We also find that, for those publicly listed victim firms whose trade secrets were allegedly stolen by the charged defendants, the stock market reaction was much more muted to the news on the case filing date if the charged defendants are of Chinese descent. Our study provides the first systematic evidence that the DOJ&#x27;s prosecutorial decisions in the application of the EEA may have been tainted by ethnic prejudice against Chinese, including American citizens of Chinese descent.</span>

We find economists and other social scientists have a key role to play in shaping the impact of algorithms, in part through improving the tools used to build them.</span>

                    <span>Debt in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is at its highest level in half a century. In about nine out of 10 EMDEs, debt is higher now than it was in 2010 and, in half of the EMDEs, debt is more than 30 percentage points of gross domestic product higher. Historically, elevated debt levels increased the incidence of debt distress, particularly in EMDEs and particularly when financial market conditions turned less benign. This paper reviews an encompassing menu of options that have, in the past, helped lower debt burdens. Specifically, it examines orthodox options (enhancing growth, fiscal consolidation, privatization, and wealth taxation) and heterodox options (inflation, financial repression, debt default and restructuring). The mix of feasible options depends on country characteristics and the type of debt. However, none of these options comes without political, economic, and social costs. Some options may ultimately be ineffective unless vigorously implemented. Policy reversals in difficult times have been common. The challenges associated with debt reduction raise questions of global governance, including to what extent advanced economies can cast their net wider to cushion prospective shocks to EMDEs.</span>

                    <span>This paper provides causal evidence of the impact of industrial policy on firms&#x27; long-term performance and quantifies industrial policy&#x27;s long-term welfare effects. Using a natural experiment and unique historical data during the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive in South Korea, we find large and persistent effects of firm-level subsidies on firm size. Subsidized firms are larger than those never subsidized even 30 years after subsidies ended. Motivated by this empirical finding, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these persistent effects through a combination of learning-by-doing (LBD) and financial frictions that hinder firms from internalizing LBD. The model is calibrated to firm-level micro data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. Counterfactual analysis implies that the industrial policy generated larger benefits than costs. If the industrial policy had not been implemented, South Korea&#x27;s welfare would have been 22-31% lower, depending on how long-lived are the productivity benefits of LBD. Between one-half and two-thirds of the total welfare difference comes from the long-term effects of the policy.</span>

                    <span>This is an invited chapter for the forthcoming Volume 4 of the Handbook of Industrial Organization. We present empirical models of demand and supply in differentiated products industries with an emphasis on the key ideas arising from the recent applied literature. We start with a discussion of the challenges in modeling and estimation of demand for  differentiated products, and focus on discrete choice characteristics-based demand models that address these challenges while allowing enough flexibility to capture realistic substitution patterns. Our discussion emphasizes how empirical strategies can leverage different features of data depending on the sources of variation that are commonly found in applied work. Moving to the supply-side, we show how demand estimates combined with a pricing model, can be used to recover markups and marginal costs. We also show how the model of pricing can be tested. We discuss a baseline Bertrand-Nash model of competitive pricing, and expand it to cover a) coordinated pricing, b) wholesale relationships, and c) bargaining. We end the chapter with extensions of the demand model, including dynamic and continuous demand.</span>

                    <span>Can democracy be exported? This column uses a large cross-country dataset from 1960 to 2015 to show that, while the ‘top-down’ imposition of political institutions is not desirable and rarely successful, democracy can indeed be ‘exported’ – from more democratic to less democratic countries – through repeated trade interactions. The finding suggests that economic integration might be advantageous to less democratic countries not only directly by fostering GDP growth, but also indirectly by favouring the transition to democracy and the socioeconomic and political benefits associated with it.</span>

Monday:
• 10:00 AM ET, The September NAHB homebuilder survey. The consensus is for a reading of  74, down from 75 in August. Any number above 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good than poor.
From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 are down 10 and DOW futures are down 103 (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $71.78	per barrel and Brent at $75.16 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $41, and Brent was at $42 - so WTI oil prices are UP 75% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic). 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.18 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.16 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.02 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

Here are some comments from Goldman Sachs economists on the timing of tapering:
The FOMC is likely to provide the promised “advance notice” that tapering is coming at its September meeting, paving the way to announce the start of tapering at its November meeting. Specifically, we expect the September FOMC statement to say something along the lines of, “The Committee expects to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases relatively soon, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.”

                    <span>There is a common perception that the US military predominantly recruits individuals from the most disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds with limited other career options. This column argues that this is no longer the case. Skill-biased technological change has led the US military to recruit more higher-skilled personnel since the 1990s, and while in 1979 the probability of joining the military was clearly higher for those with lower-than-average family income, for the 1997 cohort the probability was much more evenly distributed.</span>

In contrast, shorter hours cause the opposite effect, perhaps because workers recover from fatigue and arrive for work with increased energy and focus.</span>

 A common intuition is that borrowers put 20% down on a home.
The median down payment is actually closer to 5%, and has been for 12 years.
He included a chart from the Urban Institute showing the median LTV for new mortgage loan originations is 95% - and has been at that level for the last 12 years.   

Gupta linked to the Housing Finance Policy Center&#x27;s Monthly Chartbook
Here is the chart that also includes FICO and Debt-to-income (DTI).   The median DTI is at 37.5%.

IMPORTANT: For &quot;herd immunity&quot; most experts believe we need 70% to 85% of the total population fully vaccinated (or already had COVID).  


This is all from the CDC - state data may differ!


KUDOS to the residents of the 11 states that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: Vermont at 68.8%, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire at 60.9%.

The following 18 states and D.C. have between 50% and 59.9% fully vaccinated: Oregon at 59.6%, District of Columbia, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, California, Hawaii, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, South Dakota, Kentucky, Arizona and Kansas at 50.0%.

Next up (total population, fully vaccinated according to CDC) are Texas at 49.8%,  Nevada at 49.6%, Ohio at 49.4%, Utah at 49.2%, Alaska at 48.8% and North Carolina at 48.4%.

                    <span>From housing economist Tom Lawler (see important comments on inventory):
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.90 million in August, down 1.5%  from July’s preliminary pace and down 1.2% from last August’s seasonally adjusted   pace. Unadjusted sales should show a very small YOY gain, with the SA/NSA difference reflecting this August’s higher business day count relative to last August’s.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that while the inventory of existing homes for sale remained low last month, the YOY decline in August was significantly less than in July.  What this means for the NAR’s inventory estimate for August, however, is unclear.  As I’ve noted before, the inventory measure in most publicly-released local realtor/MLS reports excludes listings with pending contracts, but that is not the case for most of the reports sent to the NAR (referred to as the “NAR Report!”),  Since the middle of last Spring inventory measures excluding pending listings have fallen much more sharply than inventory measures including such listings, and this latter inventory measure understates the decline in the effective inventory of homes for sale over the last several months.  Having said that, however, it is clear that seasonally adjusted inventories have been trending higher over the past several months.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 14.7% from last August.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release August existing home sales on Wednesday, September 22, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 5.88 million SAAR.</span>

                    <span>GDP forecasts had been downgraded sharply for Q3 due to COVID, but now seem to have stabilized. 


Here is a table of some of the forecasts over the last two months.

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of September 14th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances Below 1.6M For First Time Since Start of Pandemic
The number of active forbearance plans fell by 22K (-1.4%) this week, bringing the total number of U.S. homeowners in COVID-19 forbearance below 1.6M for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
Matching 15,000 declines in plans among both GSE and FHA/VA loans were partially offset by an 8,000 rise in PLS/portfolio plans. Overall, forbearances are now down 156K (-8.9%) from the same time last month.
As of September 14, nearly 1.6 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 3% of all active mortgages, including 1.7% of GSE, 5.2% of FHA/VA and 3.8% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
Both new forbearance plans and plan restarts rose this week, with new plan starts trending higher since mid-August.
The rise in new plan starts is almost solely limited to FHA/VA loans, coinciding with the deadline for entry into forbearance for such loans expiring at the end of September. That said, unemployment benefits lapsed over the Labor Day weekend and COVID caseloads continue to rise, so it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.
With two weeks left in the month, we have already seen 218,000 plan exits over just the first half of September. Meanwhile, plan extensions are at their lowest since the onset of the pandemic, with only 45,000 plans extended this week.
 With more than 462,000 plans scheduled for review for extension/removal in September, exit volumes could be poised to rise sharply at the start of October. As many as 330,000 are set to reach their final plan expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

메타버스에서 요즘 화두는 디지털 가상 경제에 관한 것이다. 메타버스 이커머스로 가장 공격적인 기업으로 페이스북을 비롯해 국내 기업으로는 ‘제페토’의 네이버와 ‘이프랜드’의 SKT가 꼽힌다. SK mySUNI 부사장인 저자는 메타버스 최일선에서 터득한 메타버스의 진면목, 특히 NFT, 디파이(Defi)같은 메타버스 가상 경제의 큰 틀을 이루는 블록체인 기술에 대해서 알기 쉽게 설명할 뿐 아니라 메타버스가 가져올 시대 변화, 이에 따른 준비 등을 점검하도록 한다. 

이 책 타이틀의 ‘3번째 세상’이란 2000년 웹, 2010년 모바일, 2020년 메타버스로 이어지는 10년 주기의 디지털 산업의 큰 플랫폼의 흐름을 의미한다. 저자는 2000년대의 웹이 콘텐츠, 미디어, 커머스 산업에 위기를 가져왔고, 2010년대의 모바일이 통신, 교통, 배달 산업에 영향을 준 것처럼 2020년대의 메타버스는 또 어떤 변화를 가져올지, 그것을 위기로 만드느냐 기회로 삼느냐는 전적으로 우리의 준비에 달려 있다고 강조한다. 

또 저자는 “메타버스를 차원이 다른 세상이라고 보는 이유는 첫째, 기존 PC나 스마트폰이 보여주지 못한 입체감과 전혀 다른 경험을 제공한다는 것과 둘째, 오프라인 현실과 통합된 디지털의 경험을 제시하고 있다는 것”이라고 말한다. 또 ‘제3세상’이라는 표현도 사용하는데 “제1의 세상…</span>

채 2년도 되지 않은 기간에 우리는 이전에는 상상할 수 없었던 변화를 목격하고 있다. 어느 날 갑자기 등장한 코로나 바이러스는 개인과 기업, 시장과 사회 등 모든 분야의 추세(trend line)를 10년씩 앞당기고 있으며, 무엇보다 이러한 변화의 속도는 앞으로 점점 더 빨라질 것으로 보인다. 피할 수도, 벗어날 수도 없는 ‘거대한 가속’이 강타한 세상은 팬데믹 이후 어떤 식으로 펼쳐질 것인가? 

세계 최고의 비즈니스 스쿨 교수로 꼽히는 스콧 갤러웨이 뉴욕대 교수는 ‘비즈니스 판도, 교육 시장, 정부의 역할’이라는 3가지 키워드로 미래를 지배할 새로운 패러다임을 설득력 있게 분석한다. 팬데믹으로 양극화된 자본시장에서 더욱 강력해진 플랫폼 제국 ‘빅 4’의 다음 행보는 무엇일까? 이들에 맞서 도전하는 시장 교란자들은 누구인가? 거리 두기로 촉발된 대규모 원격 교육은 교육 시장에 어떠한 위험과 기회를 가져다줄까? 나날이 쌓여가는 자본과 혁신 속에 사회가 새롭게 주목하는 가치는 무엇이 될까? 

대변혁은 이미 시작되었고 막연히 상상했던 미래는 이미 눈앞에 다가와 있다. 살아남고, 소멸하고, 변화하는 속도가 더욱 빨라지는 시대, 이 책은 변곡점에 선 세상과 새로운 기회를 한 발 앞서 읽어낼 서슬 퍼런 인사이트를 선보인다.

다수의 사용자를 지원하는 Todo 웹 애플리케이션을 구현하고 배포한다. 또한 현장에서 많이 사용하는 프론트엔드와 백엔드 서버가 분리된 아키텍처(Decoupled Architecture)구현한다. 또한 배포 시 단순히 로컬환경이나 임시의 HTTP 서버로 배포하는 데 그치지 않고, HTTPS 인증서 설정, 로드발란서, 오토스케일링 그룹 등 AWS 클라우드 서비스를 사용해 실제 서비스 운영에 필요한 배포, 스케일링 기술을 전달한다. 이 책을 통해 스프링부트와 리액트를 이용해 애플리케이션을 구현하면서 확장 가능한 아키텍처를 구축하고 운영해 볼 수 있다.

코딩 인터뷰는 어색한 공간, 낯선 면접관 앞에서 이루어진다. 후회 없이 인터뷰를 마치려면 평소에 난이도와 주제별로 다양한 문제를 풀며 철저히 준비해 두어야 한다. 이 책은 면접관으로 수많은 인터뷰를 해 온 저자들이 집필한 소프트웨어 개발 인터뷰의 종합 안내서다.

자료구조, 탐색, 정렬, 알고리즘 설계 원칙 및 동시성 등에 관련된 문제를 장별로 제시한다. 각 장은 먼저, 문제를 풀기 위해 꼭 알고 있어야 할 내용, 중요한 라이브러리 함수 등을 설명한다. 그 후 실전처럼 문제를 분석하고 답을 내고 코드를 보여 준다. 해당 문제에 대한 설명이 끝나면 비슷한 응용 문제를 제시해 배운 내용을 한 번 더 단단히 할 수 있다.

Anil Kashyap and Kathryn Judge tell Tim Phillips what happened, why, and how to stop it happening again.

                    <span>Many countries try to bring down trade costs by striking free trade agreements, forming currency unions or joining the WTO. But when trade costs fall, how much does trade increase? This column finds that the impact depends on how intensively countries trade. Falling trade costs boost trade between countries with initially ‘thin’ trading relationships where the scope for growth is largest. But they have a much weaker impact for country pairs that are already trading heavily.</span>

IMPORTANT: For &quot;herd immunity&quot; most experts believe we need 70% to 85% of the total population fully vaccinated (or already had COVID).  


This is all from the CDC - state data may differ!


KUDOS to the residents of the 11 states that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: Vermont at 68.8%, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland. New Jersey, Washington, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire at 60.8%.

The following 16 states and D.C. have between 50% and 59.9% fully vaccinated: Oregon at 59.5%, District of Columbia, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, California, Hawaii, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, South Dakota, Kentucky and Arizona at 50.0%.

Next up (total population, fully vaccinated according to CDC) are Kansas at 49.9%, Nevada at 49.5%, Texas at 49.5%,  Ohio at 49.3%, Utah at 49.1% and Alaska at 48.6%.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.

The comparison to 2019 was difficult this week due to the timing of Labor Day.  Last week the occupancy rate was unchanged year-over-year.  If we average the last two weeks, occupancy is down about 7% compared to the same two weeks in 2019.

U.S. hotel performance fell slightly from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through September 11.
September 5-11, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 60.0% (-13.6%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $130.82 (-1.4%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $78.46 (-14.8%)
Despite the week-over-week dip, performance levels were solid on an absolute basis considering it was the week of Labor Day as well as Rosh Hashanah from Monday through Wednesday. Neither of those holidays were a factor in the corresponding week two years ago, thus creating steeper declines in comparison with 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.</span>

                    <span>As a result of global warming, carbon taxes and emissions trading policies are in the spotlight. However, lack of cross-country coordination can cause carbon leakage and increases in emissions. This column analyses the effectiveness of carbon taxes and border tax adjustment policies in reducing emissions and shaping firms’ decisions on abatement investment and firm location. It shows that a higher carbon tax can sometimes lead to higher global emissions and discourage investment in clean technology. Likewise, border tax adjustments should be designed carefully to ensure lower emissions and compatibility with WTO rules.</span>

This is all from the CDC - state data may differ!


KUDOS to the residents of the 11 states that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: Vermont at 68.7%, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland. New Jersey, Washington, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire at 60.8%.

                    <span>Notes: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Also, incoming port traffic is backed up significantly in the LA area with around 50 ships at anchor waiting to unload.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation&#x27;s container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was up 0.1% in August compared to the rolling 12 months ending in July.   Outbound traffic was down 1.3% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports - and with the backlog of ships, will probably continue strong.
Imports were up 1% YoY in August (recovered last year following the early months of the pandemic), and exports were down 14.0% YoY.</span>

                    <span>From the Fed: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in August after moving up 0.8 percent in July. Late-month shutdowns related to Hurricane Ida held down the gain in industrial production by an estimated 0.3 percentage point. Although the hurricane forced plant closures for petrochemicals, plastic resins, and petroleum refining, overall manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent. Mining production fell 0.6 percent, reflecting hurricane-induced disruptions to oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico. The output of utilities increased 3.3 percent, as unseasonably warm temperatures boosted demand for air conditioning.
At 101.6 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production in August was 5.9 percent above its year-earlier level and 0.3 percent above its pre-pandemic (February 2020) level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose 0.2 percentage point in August to 76.4 percent, a rate that is 3.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

This graph shows Capacity Utilization. This series is up from the record low set in April 2020, and slightly above the level in February 2020.
Capacity utilization at 76.4% is 3.2% below the average from 1972 to 2020.
Note: y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the change.

The second graph shows industrial production since 1967.
Industrial production increased in August to 101.6.  This is 0.3% above the February 2020 level.
The change in industrial production was slightly below consensus expectations.</span>

2021년 대한민국은 2020년에 이어 코로나19 팬데믹의 타격으로 휘청거릴 수밖에 없었다. 2020년이 유례없는 역병의 발생에 허둥지둥하며 대응책 마련에 바빴다면, 2021년은 확진자가 늘고 사회적 거리두기가 강화되면서 자영 업계의 손실과 시민들의 피로감이 극에 달했다. 동시에 하반기에 들어서며 백신 접종률이 늘어나 ‘위드 코로나(With Corona)’, 즉 코로나19 바이러스와의 공존을 모색하려는 기대감이 커진 것도 사실이다.

설령 2022년 위드 코로나 정책이 잘 자리 잡아 경제와 산업이 다시 정상화된다고 하더라도 그것이 코로나19 이전으로의 복귀를 의미하지는 않을 것이다. 많은 것이 이미 달라졌고, 앞으로 그 변화는 오히려 더 요동칠 것이다. 하지만 늘 그랬듯, 삶은 어떻게든 방법을 찾아내기 마련이다.

그렇다면 이러한 격변에 우리는 어떻게 대응할 것인가? 용맹하고 거침없는 호랑이의 기세가 기대되는 2022년, 『트렌드 코리아 2022』은 반전의 시작을 알리는 변화의 징후들을 포착하는 데 결정적인 도움을 줄 것이다.

                    <span>Concerns about the viability of democracy have deepened in recent decades amid growing discontent between and among voters, the rapid spread of misinformation, and the rise of extremist and populist parties across the West. Using large-scale survey data covering more than 110 countries, this column shows that individuals with longer exposure to successful democracies tend to exhibit stronger support for democratic institutions. Democracies breed their own support – but only when they can successfully deliver on promises of economic growth, peace, political stability, and the provision of essential public goods.</span>

                    <span>The Cleveland Fed released the median CPI and the trimmed-mean CPI this morning:
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the median Consumer Price Index rose 0.3% in August. The 16% trimmed-mean Consumer Price Index rose 0.4% in August. &quot;The median CPI and 16% trimmed-mean CPI are measures of core inflation calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on data released in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) monthly CPI report&quot;.
Note: The Cleveland Fed released the median CPI details for July here.  &quot;Car and truck rental&quot; were down 65% annualized (reversing some of the previous increase).

This graph shows the year-over-year change for these four key measures of inflation. 

On a year-over-year basis, the median CPI rose 2.4%, the trimmed-mean CPI rose 3.2%, and the CPI less food and energy rose 4.0%.  Core PCE is for July and increased 3.6% year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>The BLS reported this morning:
The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) increased 5.8 percent over the last 12 months to an index level of 268.387 (1982-84&#x3D;100). For the month, the index rose 0.2 percent prior to seasonal adjustment.  
CPI-W is the index that is used to calculate the Cost-Of-Living Adjustments (COLA). The calculation dates have changed over time (see Cost-of-Living Adjustments), but the current calculation uses the average CPI-W for the three months in Q3 (July, August, September) and compares to the average for the highest previous average of Q3 months. Note: this is not the headline CPI-U, and is not seasonally adjusted (NSA).
• In 2020, the Q3 average of CPI-W was 253.412.
The 2020 Q3 average was the highest Q3 average, so we only have to compare Q3 this year to last year.

This graph shows CPI-W since January 2000. The red lines are the Q3 average of CPI-W for each year.
Note: The year labeled for the calculation, and the adjustment is effective for December of that year (received by beneficiaries in January of the following year).
CPI-W was up 5.8% year-over-year in August, and although this is early - we need the data for September - my current guess is COLA will probably be around 5.8% this year, the largest increase since 5.8% in 2008 - and it is possible this will be the largest increase since 1982 (7.4%).
Contribution and Benefit Base
The contribution base will be adjusted using the National Average Wage Index. This is based on a one year lag. The National Average Wage Index is not available for 2020 yet, but wages probably increased again in 2020. If wages increased the same as in 2019, then the contribution base next year will increase to around $148,200 in 2022, from the current $142,800.
Remember - this is an early look.  What matters is average CPI-W, NSA, for all three months in Q3 (July, August and September).</span>

                    <span>From the BLS: 
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.3 percent in August on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.5 percent in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.
The indexes for gasoline, household furnishings and operations, food, and shelter all rose in August and contributed to the monthly all items seasonally adjusted increase. The energy index increased 2.0 percent, mainly due to a 2.8-percent increase in the gasoline index. The index for food rose 0.4 percent, with the indexes for food at home and food away from home both increasing 0.4 percent.
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.1 percent in August, its smallest increase since February 2021. Along with the indexes for household operations and shelter, the indexes for new vehicles, recreation, and medical care also rose in August. The indexes for airline fares, used cars and trucks, and motor vehicle insurance all declined over the month.
The all items index rose 5.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller increase than the 5.4-percent rise for the period ending July. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.0 percent over the last 12 months, also a smaller increase than the period ending July.

CPI and core CPI were both below expectations.  I&#x27;ll post a graph later today after the Cleveland Fed releases the median and trimmed-mean CPI.</span>

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Flat to Start The Week
Mortgage rates were fairly flat to start the new week.  This leaves the average lender in the high 2% range for top tier conventional 30yr fixed  scenarios (i.e. 20%+ equity, 740+ FICO, owner-occupied, single-family, detached homes).  This is just a bit higher than the all-time lows seen at the beginning of the year when rates were in the mid-2% range. [30 year fixed 2.94%]

Tuesday:

• At 8:30 AM, The Consumer Price Index for August from the BLS.  The consensus is for a 0.4% increase in CPI, and a 0.3% increase in core CPI.</span>

기술의 도약적 발전, 코로나 팬데믹 등 새로운 변화가 기존의 질서를 파괴하며 비즈니스 환경을 끊임없이 바꾸고 있다. 많은 사람이 경쟁을 넘어 새로운 기술을 빠르게 익히지 못하거나 변화에 적응하지 못하는 기업들은 밀려오는 변화의 물결에서 도태될 것이라고 입을 모아 말한다.

이런 상황에 발 맞춰 전 세계 기업들은 디지털 전환에 앞장서고 있다. 세계경제포럼(WEF)의 발표에 따르면 디지털 기반 플랫폼 기업이 지난 10년간 글로벌 GDP 중 신규 부가가치의 70%를 창출했다고 한다. 

디지털 전환의 선두주자인 맥킨지앤드컴퍼니에서는 전 세계 기업들의 디지털 전환은 “피할 수 없는 흐름”이라고 말하며, 전 세계 글로벌 그룹의 디지털화를 이끌어온 경험을 통해 디지털 전환을 꿈꾸는 기업의 리더들이 꼭 알아야 할 실행 전략들을 신간 《초속도(Fast Times) :디지털 전환 불변의 법칙》를 통해 제시하고 있다.

09 직원들이 업무를 수행할 역량을 갖추고 있는가? 
10 디지털 인재가 조직을 경력의 무덤으로 여기지는 않는가? 
11 신기술을 어떻게 활용할 것인가?
12 기업의 인력이 핵심 기술을 개발하고 있는가?
13 사이버 보안은 IT 전환 팀의 업무인가, 아니면 제어 기능일 뿐인가? 

PART 3 수용과 확장 : 디지털 기술, 어떻게 수용하고 확장할 것인가 
14 변화를 주도하는 사람들은 관료주의자인가, 개발자인가? 
15 모든 직원이 학습한 정보에 쉽게 접근할 수 있는가? 
16 제대로 된 노력을 기울이고 있는가? 
17 직원들에게 의미 있는 방식으로 소통하고 있는가? 
18 끝까지 전환을 이뤄낼 준비가 됐는가? 

무엇을 얼마나 배웠는가? 
나오며 지금 우리에게 가장 중요한 것들

                    <span>Financial innovation is intensely controversial, yet we know little about where or by whom these new products and services are developed. This column looks at over 24,000 financial US patents applied for between 2000 and 2018 to analyse the nature of financial patents. A surge in financial patenting was driven by IT firms and firms in industries outside of finance. Financial regulatory actions seem to have adversely affected innovation by financial firms, while regions with the highest technological opportunities attracted financial innovation by IT and non-financial firms.</span>

                    <span>Firms may face bottlenecks forcing them to cut activity and adjust prices when monetary tightening financially constrains their business partners. This column focuses on firms producing intermediate goods in the US to show how monetary policy can have ‘ripple effects’ along supply chains through input-output linkages involving financially constrained firms. These transmission channels of monetary policy may be especially relevant in the post-Covid context of higher corporate leverage, significant supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures.</span>

광복 이후 2019년까지 한국적이고 현대적인 통화와 금융제도가 어떻게 형성되고 발전되어 왔으며 정책적으로 어떻게 활용되었는가를 다룬다. 광복 이후 경제적 혼란 속에서 한국적인 통화 및 금융제도가 왜 어떻게 형성되었으며, 경제개발 시대에 왜 어떻게 재편되고 통제되면서 활용되었으며, 금융자유화 시대에는 이 제도가 왜 어떻게 자율화되고 개방되었으며, 그 결과는 무엇이었는가도 살펴보고 있다.

지금껏 박종훈이 예측한 경제는 전부 들어맞았다. 수많은 베스트셀러를 출간해 대한민국 경제 흐름을 예측했던 그가 이번에는 『부의 시그널』을 통해 불황 이후 찾아올 세계 경제 패러다임 속 5가지 경제 시그널을 주목한다.

이미 유튜브 채널 「박종훈의 경제한방」에서 친절하고 재미있는 설명으로 많은 사람들이 경제에 친근해질 수 있도록 도왔던 저자는 이번 책에서는 더욱더 친절하고 쉬운 설명으로 독자들에게 다가간다. 『부의 시그널』은 돈과 관련한 다양한 역사적 사건과 경제 흐름을 재미있는 일러스트로 담아내 전작들과 차별화를 두었다. 

놀라운 혁신은 이미 과거로부터 날아왔다. 우리가 돈의 흐름에 주목해야 하는 이유는 분명하다. 반복되어왔던 돈의 흐름 속에서 부의 시그널을 발견할 수 있다면, 미래의 위기 속에서도 내 자산을 지키고 부를 손에 넣을 수 있다. 

변화가 커질수록 부의 기회 역시 커질 수밖에 없다. 새로운 기회는 끝없이 찾아오지만, 그 해답을 알기 위해선 스스로 준비해야만 한다. 흥미로운 이야기를 따라가다 보면 세계 경제의 흐름과 앞으로 한국 경제의 전망까지 꿰뚫어 볼 수 있다. 지금, 부의 시그널을 포착해 미래의 부를 향해 나아가자.

백악관과 미 의회가 설치한 인공지능국가안보위원회 NSCAI가 3년만에 보고서(2021년 3월)를 발표했다. 이 책은 최종보고서(두차례 중간보고서 발표)를 번역, 편집한 것이다. 보고서는 미국과 중국의 첨단 인공지능 기술의 현황 및 장단점을 분석하고, 미국의 향후 행동방향까지 제시해 놓았다.

쿼드, 파이브 아이즈 가입 문제를 비롯, 국제 디지털민주주의 이니셔티브, 반도체 동맹, 우주개발 참여 등 한국 관련 부분도 상당량 기술되어 있다(56~57쪽, 96쪽 ). 지난 5월 중순 백악관에서 문재인 대통령과 조 바이든 대통령의 정상회담에 올려진 반도체 관련 의제도 이 보고서의 지침에 따른 것이다. 향후 미국의 동맹국 정책도 이 지침에 기반해 이뤄질 것이다.

향후 미국은 이 보고서를 토대로 미국은 인공지능 선진 국가로 미국을 혁신할 것이며, 중국 역시 인공지능 개발 프로젝트를 국가적 시활을 걸고 밀어붙히고 있다. 이번 번역된 백악관 AI 리포트는 미중 두 나라의 전략과 더불어 한국을 비롯한 선진 각국이 따라할 인공지능 전략을 망라하고 있다. 

FAANG(페이스북, 아마존, 애플, 넷플릭스, 구글)은 물론, BAT(바이두, 알리바바, 텐센트 등
오늘날 대표적인 글로벌 IT 기술 분야 공룡 기업들은 AI 혁명에 올인하고 있다. 아마존의 CEO 제프 베이조스가 말했듯이, 인류는 현재 AI의 황금시대를 시작하려한다. AI는 미래 경제성장과 국가안보에 직결되는 첨단 기술이 되고 있다.

                    <span>This paper discusses contributions that industrial organization economists have made to our understanding of energy markets and environmental regulation. We emphasize the substantive contributions of recent papers while also highlighting how this literature has adopted and sometimes augmented theoretical and empirical tools from industrial organization. Many of the topics examined by this literature—especially auctions, investment, productivity and innovation, and regulation—also apply to a variety of settings beyond energy and the environment. We also indicate areas where future research is likely to be fruitful, with an emphasis on how industrial organization economists can help inform energy and environmental policies.</span>

                    <span>Middlemen are ubiquitous in supply chains. In developing countries they help bring products from remote communities to end markets but may exert strong market power. We study a cooperative intervention which organizes together poor fishing communities in the Amazon — one of the poorest and most remote regions of the world — to purchase large boats in order to partially bypass middlemen and deliver their fish directly to market. We find that the intervention increases income by 27%, largely through an increase in price received, and also increases consumption. Moreover, the intervention is highly cost effective with the projected stream of income gains easily covering the cost of the investment. Finally, we formalize a model in which the market power of middlemen itself can create a poverty trap, which can be eliminated with cooperative investment.</span>

                    <span>I reconsider the long-standing consensus view that macroeconomic stabilization should rely on monetary policy, not fiscal policy. I use an analytically tractable heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model that is parameterized so as to admit a bubble in public debt. In this context, I show that it is possible to stabilize either inflation or output in response to aggregate shocks by varying only fiscal policy (that is, lump-sum uniform transfers). In contrast, when the public debt bubble is large, it is impossible to stabilize either inflation or output by varying only interest rates (monetary policy). The theoretical analysis implies that, in the presence of a large public debt bubble, fiscal policy is a more reliable stabilization tool than monetary policy.</span>

                    <span>We show that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), from its inception in the 1930s, did not insure mortgages in low income urban neighborhoods where the vast majority of urban Black Americans lived.  The agency evaluated neighborhoods using block-level information collected by New Deal relief programs and the Census in many cities.  The FHA’s exclusionary pattern predates the advent of the infamous maps later made by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) and shows little change after the drafting of those maps.  In contrast, the HOLC itself broadly loaned to such neighborhoods and to Black homeowners.  We conclude that the HOLC’s redlining maps had little effect on the geographic distribution of either program’s mortgage market activity, and that the FHA crafted and implemented its own redlining methodology prior to the HOLC.</span>

                    <span>Banks’ reluctance to repair their balance sheets, combined with deposit insurance and regulatory forbearance in recognizing greater risks and losses, can lead to solvency problems that look like liquidity (bank-run) crises. Regulatory forbearance incentivizes banks to both retain risky loans and reject new good opportunities. With sufficient regulatory forbearance, partially-insured banks act exactly as if they are fully insured. Stress tests certify that uninsured creditors will be paid, not that banks are solvent, and have ambiguous effects on the efficiency of investment.</span>

                    <span>We study how referral hiring contributes to racial inequality in firm-level labor demand over the firm&#x27;s life cycle using data from Brazil. We consider a search model where referral networks are segregated, firms are more informed about the match quality of referred candidates, and some referrals are made by non-referred employees. Consistent with the model, we find that firms are more likely to hire candidates and less likely to dismiss employees of the same race as the founder, but these differences diminish as firms&#x27; cumulative hires increase. Referral hiring helps to explain racial differences in dismissals, seniority, and employer size.</span>

                    <span>In many regions of the world, sparse data on key economic outcomes inhibits the development, targeting, and evaluation of public policy.  We demonstrate how advancements in satellite imagery and machine learning can help ameliorate these data and inference challenges. In the context of an expansion of the electrical grid across Uganda, we show how a combination of satellite imagery and computer vision can be used to develop local-level livelihood measurements appropriate for inferring the causal impact of electricity access on livelihoods. We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by 0.17 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate over our study period relative to untreated areas.  Our results provide country-scale evidence on the impact of a key infrastructure investment, and provide a low-cost, generalizable approach to future policy evaluation in data sparse environments.</span>

                    <span>We develop an empirical model of the mechanism used to assign police officers to Chicago districts and examine the efficiency and equity of alternative allocations. We document that the current bidding process, which grants priority based on seniority, results in the assignment of more experienced officers to less violent and high-income neighborhoods. Our empirical model combines estimates of heterogeneous officer preferences underlying the bidding process with causal estimates of the effects of officer experience on neighborhood crime. Equalizing officer seniority across districts would reduce violent crime rate by 4.6 percent and significantly decrease inequality in crime, discretionary arrests, and officer use of force across neighborhoods. Moreover, this assignment can be achieved in a revenue-neutral way while resulting in small welfare gains for police officers, implying that it is more equitable and efficient.</span>

                    <span>Deaths of despair, morbidity and emotional distress continue to rise in the US. The increases are largely borne by those without a four-year college degree—the majority of American adults. For many less-educated Americans, the economy and society are no longer providing the basis for a good life. Concurrently, all-cause mortality in the US is diverging by education—falling for the college-educated and rising for those without a degree—something not seen in other rich countries. We review the rising prevalence of pain, despair, and suicide among Americans without a BA. Pain and despair created a baseline demand for opioids, but the escalation of addiction came from pharma and its political enablers. We examine “the politics of despair,” how less-educated people have abandoned and been abandoned by the Democratic Party. While healthier states once voted Republican in presidential elections, now the least-healthy states do. We review the evidence on whether or not deaths of despair have risen during the COVID pandemic. More broadly, excess mortality from COVID has not increased the ratio of all-cause mortality rates for those with and without a four-year degree, but has instead replicated the pre-existing mortality ratio.</span>

A flight to safety generates a dollar appreciation and decline in global output.  Dollar bonds thus command a negative risk premium and the U.S. holds a levered portfolio of capital financed in dollars.  We quantify the effects of safety shocks and heterogeneity in risk-bearing capacity for global macroeconomic volatility; U.S. external adjustment; and the international transmission of monetary and fiscal policies, including dollar swap lines.</span>

                    <span>Using new large-scale survey and experimental data, we investigate how respondents perceive racial inequities between Black and white Americans, what they believe causes them, and what interventions, if any, they think should be implemented to reduce them. We intentionally oversample Black respondents, cover many cities in the US, and survey both adults and very young people aged 13 to 17. In the experimental parts, we consider the causal impact of information on racial inequities (such as the evolution of the Black-white earnings gap or the differences in mobility for Black and white children) and explanations for these inequities (i.e., the deep-seated roots and long-lasting consequences of systemic racism) on respondents&#x27; views. Although there is heterogeneity in how respondents perceive the magnitude of current racial gaps in economic conditions and opportunities, the biggest discrepancies are in how they explain them. There is a stark partisan gap among white respondents, particularly in the perceived causes of racial inequities and what should be done about them. White Democrats and Black respondents are much more likely to attribute racial inequities to adverse past and present circumstances and want to act on them with race-targeted and general redistribution policies. At the same time, white Republicans are more likely to attribute racial gaps to individual actions. These views are already deeply entrenched in teenagers based on their race and their parents&#x27; political affiliation. A policy decomposition shows that the perceived causes of racial inequities correlate most strongly with support for race-targeted or general redistribution policies, a finding confirmed by the experimental results.</span>

                    <span>This essay discusses several potential economic, political and social costs of the current path of AI technologies. I argue that if AI continues to be deployed along its current trajectory and remains unregulated, it may produce various social, economic and political harms. These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy&#x27;s most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI&#x27;s promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research.

                    <span>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is one of the most important reforms of the US health insurance system since the introduction of Medicare. Since employment is a main source of health insurance for the working age population in the United States, this sweeping health insurance reform also has important implications for the labor market and the macro economy. In this paper, we survey the prototype models that are used in the macro and labor literature, extended to integrate health and health insurance, to study the short- and long-run consequences of the ACA. We also suggest open areas for future research.</span>

                    <span>We develop new semiparametric methods for estimating treatment effects. We focus on a setting where the outcome distributions may be thick tailed, where treatment effects are small, where sample sizes are large and where assignment is completely random. This setting is of particular interest in recent experimentation in tech companies. We propose using parametric models for the treatment effects, as opposed to parametric models for the full outcome distributions. This leads to semiparametric models for the outcome distributions. We derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for this setting, and propose efficient estimators. In the case with a constant treatment effect one of the proposed estimators has an interesting interpretation as a weighted average of quantile treatment effects, with the weights proportional to (minus) the second derivative of the log of the density of the potential outcomes. Our analysis also results in an extension of Huber&#x27;s model and trimmed mean to include asymmetry and a simplified condition on linear combinations of order statistics, which may be of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>In the world of omnichannel retail, some brands open a flagship store at online marketplaces, while others avert it. Focusing on a large e-commerce platform, we empirically study how flagship entry affects consumers, the platform, and various sellers on the platform. 
We find flagship entry may benefit consumers by expanding the choice set, by intensifying price competition within the entry brand, and by improving consumer perception for parts of the platform. In the meantime, flagship entry cannibalizes the sales of same-brand sellers, while other brands may gain as the buyer base expands on the platform. 
Counterfactual simulation suggests that flagship entry improves the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the platform but hurts existing sellers of the entry brand. On average, the effect on consumer welfare is more positive if the flagship entry is from a non-prominent brand than from a prominent brand, because consumers tend to lower their willingness to pay for individual sellers upon a prominent flagship entry. In hypothetical scenarios where flagship entry were accompanied by constraints on other same-brand sellers, the reduced competition would benefit the flagship store but hurt consumers.</span>

                    <span>Carbon taxation is a widely proposed and in some countries already adopted means to limit anthropogenic climate change. This paper studies carbon taxation using an 18-region, 80- period overlapping generations model. We focus on carbon policy that delivers present and future mankind the highest uniform percentage welfare gain. The policy combines global carbon taxation and region- and generation-specific net transfers. In our main calibration, uniform welfare-improving carbon tax policy can make those agents already here and those yet to come, no matter their location, 4.35 percent better off. Achieving (such) equal proportionate gains, which may be needed for universal support, requires major interregional as well as intergenerational transfers. Universal support, though, is not essential. For example, even absent participation by China, whose projected carbon emissions are massive, the rest of the world can still materially limit the carbon externality. However, absent China, their optimal carbon tax is roughly half as large, and the uniform welfare-improving gain is less than three-fifths as large.</span>

                    <span>What is the impact on intra-national trade and regional economic outcomes when the quality and lane-capacity of an existing paved road network is expanded significantly? We investigate this question for the case of Turkey, which undertook a large-scale public investment in roads during the 2000s. Using spatially disaggregated data on road upgrades and domestic transactions, we estimate a large positive impact of reduced travel times on trade as well as local manufacturing employment and wages. A quantitative exercise using a workhorse model of spatial equilibrium implies heterogeneous effects across locations, with aggregate real income gains reaching 2-3 percent in the long-run. Reductions in travel times increased local employment-to-population ratio but had no effect on local population. We extend the model by endogenizing the labor supply decision to capture this finding. The model-implied elasticity of employment rates to travel time reductions captures about one-third of the empirical elasticity.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the source, magnitude, and unevenness of the procyclical forces that shape labor force participation, i.e., the participation cycle, which are important for the implementation of the maximum employment mandate. We show that these forces can be analyzed in real time using a flow decomposition of the changes in the labor force participation rate. The decomposition reveals that the source of the participation cycle is fluctuations in job-loss and job-finding rates, rather than cyclical movements in labor force entry and exit rates. The magnitude of the participation cycle is large. Cyclical downward pressures on employment from participation are two-thirds that of unemployment. Moreover, the participation cycle delays the recovery in employment because it lags the unemployment cycle. It also amplifies the unevenness of the impact of recessions. Groups that see large increases in their unemployment rates also experience more pronounced participation cycles. Despite differences in their magnitudes, the source of the participation cycle is the same for all groups. Application of our method to the COVID-19 Recession suggests that, as of June 2021, the bulk of the drop in the participation rate since the onset of the pandemic is cyclical and that the cyclical recovery in participation likely will trail that of the unemployment rate.</span>

We compare firms that complete their IPO with firms that withdraw their IPO. We instrument the going public decision using prior market returns. We find that firm profitability goes up after going public—contrary to previous results in the literature. We also find an post-IPO expansion in the number of subsidiaries and countries in which IPO firms operate. Our results are stronger for firms in financially dependent industries and in countries with higher investor protection consistent with going public relaxing financial constraints and with a stronger impact when agency conflicts are lower.  Overall, our results are consistent with going public inducing a shift towards a strategy of commercialization to increase profitability.</span>

                    <span>I study a general equilibrium menu cost model with a continuum of sectors, idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, and the novel feature that each sector consists of strategically engaged firms. Compared to an economy with monopolistically competitive sectors—separately parameterized to match the same microdata on price flexibility—the oligopoly economy features a smaller response of inflation to monetary shocks and output responses that are more than twice as large. Under the same parameters, output responses are five times larger. An oligopoly economy also (i) requires smaller menu costs and idiosyncratic shocks to match the microdata, addressing a significant challenge for mechanisms that generate non-neutrality via strategic complementarities, (ii) implies four times larger welfare losses from same sized nominal rigidities, and (iii) provides a novel rationale for positive menu costs: in an oligopoly firms prefer a degree of rigidity to complete flexibility. Quantitatively, the estimated degree of nominal rigidity is found to be close to optimal, from firms’ perspective.</span>

                    <span>Canonical human capital theories posit that education, by enhancing worker skills, reduces the likelihood that a worker will be laid-off during times of economic change. Yet, this has not been demonstrated causally. We link administrative education records from 1987 through 2002 to nationally representative surveys conducted before and after COVID-19 onset in Barbados to explore the causal impact of improved education on job loss during this period. Using a regression discontinuity (RD) design, Beuermann and Jackson (2020) show that females (but not males) who score just above the admission threshold for more selective schools in Barbados attain more years of education than those that scored just below (essentially holding initial ability fixed). Here, in follow-up data, we show that these same females (but not males) are much less likely to have lost a job after the onset of COVID-19. We show that these effects are not driven by sectoral changes, or changes in labor supply. Because employers observe incumbent worker productivity, these patterns are inconsistent with pure education signalling, and suggest that education enhances worker skill.</span>

                    <span>Why are certain communities more prone to anti-government protests than others? Do past rebellions lead to more protests today? We study the historical roots of social unrest using the experience of China. We document that counties with higher incidence of peasant uprisings against local government officials during the Qing dynasty period (1644-1912) also have higher incidence of anti-government protests in present-day China. To generate plausibly exogenous variation in the incidence of past protests, we exploit differences in the visibility and magnitude of solar eclipses during the Qing dynasty period. In the Confucian tradition, solar eclipses are considered a negative divine signal on the legitimacy of the ruler, facilitating the coordination of protest actions. We test this mechanism using detailed data on the timing and location of anti-government rebellions extracted from local chronicles. Counties within the totality zone of a solar eclipse were significantly more likely to experience a rebellion in the eclipse year. Leaders of early anti-Qing rebellions were recorded in popular culture and celebrated in temples, favoring the transmission of the memory of their actions across generations. The persistent effect of past protests is stronger in counties with such temples and memorials, consistent with a long-term memory of revolutions.</span>

                    <span>This paper develops a 17-region, 3-skill group, overlapping generations, computable general equilibrium model to evaluate the global consequences of automation. Automation, modeled as capital- and high-skill biased technological change, is endogenous with regions adopting new technologies when profitable. Our approach captures and quantifies key macro implications of a range of foundational models of automation. In our baseline scenario, automation has a moderate effect on regional outputs and a small effect on world interest rates. However, it has a major impact on inequality, both wage inequality within regions and per capita GDP inequality across regions. We examine two policy responses to technological change -- mandating use of the advanced technology and providing universal basic income to share gains from automation. The former policy can raise a region&#x27;s output, but at a welfare cost. The latter policy can transform automation into a win-win for all generations in a region.</span>

                    <span>Asset prices are a valuable source of information about financial market participants&#x27; expectations about key macroeconomic variables. However, the presence of time-varying risk premia requires an adjustment of market prices to obtain the market&#x27;s rational assessment of future price and policy developments. This paper reviews empirical approaches for recovering market-based expectations. It starts by laying out the two canonical modeling frameworks that form the backbone for estimating risk premia and highlights the proliferation of risk pricing factors that result in a wide range of different asset-price-based expectation measures. It then describes a key methodological innovation to evaluate the empirical plausibility of risk premium estimates and to identify the most accurate market-based expectation measure. The usefulness of this general approach is illustrated for price expectations in the global oil market. Then, the paper provides an overview of the body of empirical evidence for monetary policy and inflation expectations with a special emphasis on market-specific characteristics that complicate the quest for the best possible market-based expectation measure. Finally, it discusses a number of economic applications where market expectations play a key role for evaluating economic models, guiding policy analysis, and deriving shock measures.</span>

                    <span>This paper analyses the effect of a firm’s organizational capacity on the reported profitability of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Better organizational practices improve productivity and the potential taxable profits of firms. However, higher adoption of these practices may also enable more efficient allocation of profits across tax jurisdictions, lowering actual taxable profits. We present new evidence that MNE subsidiaries with better such practices, when located in high-tax countries, report significantly lower profits and have a higher incidence of bunching around zero returns on assets. We show these results are driven by patterns consistent with profit-shifting behavior. Further, using an event study design, we find that firms with better practices are more responsive to corporate tax rate changes. Our results suggest organizational capacity, especially monitoring-related practices, enables firms to engage in shifting profits away from their high-tax subsidiaries.</span>

Carter, Jon Einar Flatnes, Travis J. Lybbert, Jonathan G. Malacarne, Paswel Marenya, Laura A. Paul</summary>

                    <span>Risk often inhibits on-farm investment by smallholder farmers. Recent evidence indicates that index insurance and stress tolerant seeds can separately and partially offset this risk effect. In this study, we explore whether the complementarities between these two risk management technologies can be harnessed to underwrite a resilient, high productivity small farm sector. Utilizing a multi-year randomized control trial that spanned two countries and exploits natural variation in weather shocks, we find that drought tolerant maize seeds mitigate the impact of mid-season drought. Compared to farms in control villages, where shocks have persistent effects that reduce future investment and productivity, those with access to both drought tolerant seeds and multi-peril index insurance show greater resilience and immediately bounce back from shocks. Experiential learning is key to realizing this resilience effect: Farmers who experienced shocks intensify their subsequent use of the technologies and exhibit what we call resilience-plus, while those who did not experience shocks disadopt. Together these findings showcase important complementarities between these risk mitigating technologies and the crucial role learning plays in tapping their potential stochastic and dynamic benefits to small farmers.</span>

                    <span>Research on house price cycles and their interactions with the economy has burgeoned since the Global Financial Crisis. This column draws five lessons from a recent comprehensive survey. It argues that conventional theories of house price dynamics are misleading. Shifts in credit conditions, together with differences in housing supply response across cities, regions and countries, account for much of the heterogeneity of house price outcomes. Finally, increased demand for space and unprecedented policy interventions together explain the very different house price experience in the pandemic compared with the Global Financial Crisis.</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 has had large impacts on global production and international trade. The column uses quarterly aggregate-level data on foreign affiliates of Japanese multinational corporations to show that multinational production and supply chains were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the 2nd quarter of 2020. The sales of Japanese manufacturing affiliates almost recovered in the 4th quarter of 2020, indicating the resilience of global production and multinationals’ supply chains. But there are large variations in recovery across countries.</span>

From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 are up 9 and DOW futures are up 70 (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $69.75 per barrel and Brent at $72.94 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $37, and Brent was at $39 - so WTI oil prices are UP 90% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic). 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.16 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.16 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.00 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>The US equity market follows a V-shaped pattern around recessions, with sharply negative returns heading into recessions and a strong recovery as the recession unfolds. In addition, recessions are usually preceded by an inverted yield curve. This column shows that the term spread is a robust predictor of recessions, and that model-implied recession probability forecasts do a good job of predicting the equity premium out-of-sample. An investment strategy based on the recession probability model could be used to time the equity market and lead to higher and less volatile profits over time.</span>

                    <span>It has been argued that Increased uncertainty can worsen unemployment if employers prefer to wait and postpone job creation. However, under the dominant theory of unemployment – the search-and-matching model – the value of waiting plays no role. This column proposes an amended model which relaxes some of the theoretical assumptions, and shows that an increase in perceived uncertainty does indeed increase the value of waiting, thus reducing job creation.</span>

                    <span>The FDIC released the Quarterly Banking Profile for Q2 2021 this week: 
Net income totaled $70.4 billion, an increase of $51.9 billion (281 percent) from the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $73 billion (117.3 percent) decline in provision expense.
...
Total loan and lease balances increased $33.2 billion (0.3 percent) from the previous quarter. This was the first quarterly increase in loan volume since second quarter 2020. An increase in credit card loan balances (up $30.9 billion, or 4.1 percent), supplemented by an increase in auto loan balances (up $18.9 billion, or 3.8 percent), drove the growth.
Loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status (i.e., noncurrent loans) continued to decline (down $13.2 billion, or 10.8 percent) from first quarter 2021. The noncurrent rate for total loans declined 12 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.01 percent. Net charge-offs also continued to decline (down $8.3 billion, or 53.2 percent) from a year ago. The total net charge-off rate dropped 30 basis points to 0.27 percent—the lowest level on record.

The FDIC reported the number of problem banks declined by four from the first quarter to 51.
This graph from the FDIC shows the number of problem banks and assets at 51 institutions.
Note: The number of assets for problem banks increased significantly back in 2018 when Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas was added to the list (it must still be on the list given the assets of problem banks).
The dollar value of 1-4 family residential Real Estate Owned (REOs, foreclosure houses) declined from $1.73 billion in Q2 2020 to $0.85 billion in Q2 2021.  This is the lowest level of REOs in many years.  (probably declined sharply due to foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance programs).
This graph shows the nominal dollar value of Residential REO for FDIC insured institutions.  Note: The FDIC reports the dollar value and not the total number of REOs.</span>

                    <span>GDP forecasts have been downgraded sharply for Q3 due to COVID.  

The surge in COVID cases has impacted some consumer spending, caused further supply chain disruptions, and possibly some downgrades due to policy (expiration of unemployment benefits during a COVID wave).

Here is a table of some downgrades over the last 40 days.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.
The occupancy rate was unchanged compared to the same week in 2019 due to Labor Day demand and Hurricane Ida.

From CoStar: Labor Day Demand, Hurricane Ida Evacuations Reverse Five-Week US Hotel Occupancy Slide
Labor Day weekend leisure travel and Hurricane Ida-related demand lifted U.S. hotel occupancy out of a five-week slump.
After declining for the past five weeks, weekly U.S. hotel occupancy inched up 30 basis points for the week ending Sept. 4 to 61.3%, according to the latest data from CoStar hospitality analytics firm STR.  Weekend occupancy, Friday and Saturday, increased to 77%, which was the country’s highest since the first week of August.
Compared with Labor Day weekend in 2019, which was a week earlier, occupancy was nearly the same, indicating the desire to travel remains strong despite the increase in COVID-19 cases, and occupancy declines over the past several weeks are more due to the return of in-person schools and the slow materialization of business and group travel.
emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, occupancy has been declining due to both seasonal factors and the &quot;pandemic situation&quot;.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - usually weekly occupancy increases up to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.</span>

This data is as of September 7th.
From Black Knight: Forbearances Decrease
The number of active forbearance plans fell by 92K (-5.4%) this week, driven by lingering August expirations and new activity taking place in September.
Volumes fell significantly across all investor classes, with portfolio/PLS plans seeing the greatest decline at 40K (-7.7%). Plans were also down 26K among both FHA/VA and GSE loans, for -3.8% and -5.1% declines, respectively. Overall, plan volumes are now down 129K (-7.4%) from the same time last month and have fallen by 3.1M (-67%) from their peak in May 2020.
Additional activity is expected later in the month as well, with nearly 540K plans still scheduled for review for extension/removal in September. Of those, nearly 400K are set to reach their final plan expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

Significant volume declines could still be seen in coming weeks as those plans reach their final expirations and exiting borrowers return to making mortgage payments in October.

팬데믹 이후 세계는 각종 품귀 현상에 꾸준히 시달리고 있다. 마스크를 구매하기 위해 긴 줄을 선 사람들은 물론, 소독제와 화장지 등 공산품에 대한 품귀현상이 있었고, 원재료가 없어 반도체나 자동차 공장이 셧다운을 맞기도 했다. 최근에는 어떤 백신을 얼마나 수급할 것인지가 모두의 관심사이다. 이전의 많은 팬데믹도 마찬가지지만, 코로나19는 특히 우리 모두가 서로에게 의존하고 있음을 증명해주었다. 한 사람은, 나아가 하나의 기업과 국가는 결코 독단적으로 생존할 수 없다.

현 MIT 교수인 요시 셰피는 서플라이 체인 분야의 세계적 석학이자 선구자이다. 특히 서플라이 체인에 대한 학술적 전문성과 함께 직접 기업을 운영해온 실무적인 지식을 더한 경력을 바탕으로 회복탄력성(리질리언스)을 강조하며 기업의 유연한 대처를 강조왔다. 이 책에는 불확실하고 예측할 수 없는 포스트 팬데믹 시대를 기회로 전환한 세계 기업의 사례가 설명되어 있다.

앞으로도 새로운 팬데믹의 발생이나 정치적 불안정, 기후 변화 및 자원 고갈 등 수많은 문제가 기업의 생존을 위협할 가능성은 높다. 그러나 이 책이 제시하는 프레임워크와 여러 사례가 다음에 닥칠 위기에 맞서 번창하는 데 도움을 줄 것이다.

                    <span>I&#x27;m tracking new cases, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID, mostly to assess the impact on the economy.
Just over a month ago, many Americans, and economic analysts, assumed COVID was mostly behind us. Unfortunately they were wrong, and COVID has impacted the economic outlook once again.
For example, on July 30th, Goldman Sachs wrote: &quot;we are launching our Q3 GDP tracking estimate at +9.0% (qoq ar)&quot;
Then in mid-August, they downgraded their forecast: &quot;We have lowered our Q3 GDP forecast to +5.5%, reflecting hits to both consumer spending and production.&quot;
And this week, on September 6th, they downgraded their forecast again: “We now expect GDP growth of 3.5% in Q3.&quot;  That is about one third of the real growth they expected just 5 weeks ago!
Other analysts have made similar downgrades for Q3.  There are several reasons for the change: the surge in COVID cases has impacted some consumer spending, supply chain disruptions are ongoing (and COVID is impacting the supply chain recovery), and possibly some downgrades due to policy (expiration of unemployment benefits during a COVID wave).

Right now it is looking like new cases are peaking, but far above the 12,000 per day level we saw in June.   And it looks like we might see another Winter wave for several reasons:


1) There is a huge reservoir of virus (about 150,000 new cases have been reported per day).


2) Schools are reopening, and kids spread the virus easily.


3) Many Americans have moved past taking even the easiest mitigation efforts (like wearing masks indoors).


4) Only 53.4% of Americans are vaccinated, and the percent is increasing very slowly.

A severe winter COVID wave could be a significant economic drag in Q4, and Q1 2022.  And the most vulnerable are losing their extended unemployment benefits, and could be facing eviction.  Hopefully there won&#x27;t be another wave.  Best to all</span>

                    <span>From Dodge Data Analytics: Dodge Momentum Index Loses Steam in August
The Dodge Momentum Index dropped 3% in August to 148.7 (2000&#x3D;100) from the revised July reading of 154.0. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Data &amp; Analytics, is a monthly measure of the first (or initial) report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year.
The commercial planning component lost 2% in August, while the institutional component fell by 6%.
Projects entering the earliest stages of planning have declined following the torrid pace set in the spring. The decline in August was the third consecutive drop in the Momentum Index, which is now off 14% from the most recent high in May, since May the commercial component is down 10% and the institutional component is 22% lower. This reversal comes as prices for materials used in nonresidential buildings increase in combination with a shortage of labor and a rising number of new COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant, all working in concert to undermine confidence in the fledgling construction recovery. There were some pockets of strength in August, however, as more data center, education and warehouse projects moved into planning relative to the prior month. Additionally, the overall level of the Momentum Index is 19% higher than one year ago; institutional planning was up 17% and commercial planning was 20% higher than last year.

This graph shows the Dodge Momentum Index since 2002. The index was at 148.7 in August, down from 154.0 in July.
According to Dodge, this index leads &quot;construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year&quot;.  This index suggests a decline in Commercial Real Estate construction through most of 2021, but perhaps a pickup towards the end of the year, and growth in 2022 (even with the decline in the August index).</span>

2017년 한국은 이미 1인당 국민소득 3만 달러를 넘었지만 이후 횡보하고 있다. 저성장의 고착화가 그 배경이다. 저자들은 저성장과 일자리 부족의 원인을 직업 간 과도한 보상격차와 비싼 부동산가격으로 인한 고비용구조로 일목요연하게 설명한다. 그리고 지속 성장과 일자리 창출을 위한 중요 과제를 구체적으로 제시한다. 정책의 실현 가능성을 높이기 위한 방안도 적시하고 있다.

부동산 불패의 신화는 언제까지 계속될 것인가? 문재인 정부는 출범 초기부터 부동산시장 안정화를 최우선 과제 중 하나로 내세워 여러 대책을 쏟아냈지만 그때마다 이를 비웃기라도 하듯 부동산가격은 오히려 급등하기만 했다. 열심히 돈 모아 집을 산다는 예전 식의 내 집 마련은 그야말로 꿈이 되어버렸고, 정부의 약속대로 ‘사는 것’이 아닌 ‘사는 곳’을 바랐던 서민들의 박탈감은 그만큼 더욱 커져만 가고 있다. 

그런데 아이러니한 것은 무주택자뿐만 아니라 집값 폭등으로 큰 이득을 본 1주택자도, 다주택자도 이 상황이 만족스럽지 않다는 것이다. 집 없는 사람은 집을 사기는커녕 빌려 사는 것조차 녹록지 않아 난리고, 집 있는 사람은 시세 차익 환수에 따른 세금 부담으로 난리다. 또 하나의 아이러니는 부동산과 관련한 각종 통계 지표와 국민들의 체감 현실 사이에 상당한 괴리가 있다는 것이다. 

대표적인 국제 주택시장 비교 사이트인 ‘글로벌 프로퍼티 가이드’와 OECD 등의 가격 변동 통계에 따르면, 우리나라의 집값 상승률은 평균적으로 다른 나라들보다 낮은 편이다. 특히 OECD 국가 중에서는 일본과 함께 하위권을 형성하고 있다. 물론 비교 기준의 문제로 논란이 있긴 하지만, 단지 ‘통계의 함정’으로만 치부할 수는 없는 노릇이다. 이를 어떻게 보아야 할까? 좀 더 거시적이고 냉철한 비교 연구가 요구되는 시점이다.

PHP나 프로그래밍의 기초를 배우고자 하는 초보자용으로, 문장보다는 이미지를 전면에 내세워 설명하고 있다. 캐릭터 베이스의 프로그램을 작성함으로써 PHP의 개념의 확실한 이해 도모를 목적으로 하고 있다. 그리고 일러스트와 그림을 많이 사용하고 있으므로 단순히 문장으로만 설명하는 것보다 이미지 전달이 더 정확할 것이다.

                    <span>In contrast to other comparable developing countries, wage inequality in Japan has remained stable in recent decades. However, this trend belies the substantial variation in wage gaps at the firm level. This column uses detailed worker and firm microdata to study how firm characteristics affect the evolution and variability of Japan’s college wage gap. It finds that larger establishments and those with a larger share of regular workers exhibit higher college wage premiums. These traits likely signify more productive environments with greater capacity to attract and keep highly educated employees with better unobservable characteristics.</span>

                    <span>In the aftermath of the 2007–09 financial crisis, central banks have sought to stimulate the economy through new policies aimed at revamping credit and housing markets. This column examines the effects of the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme, which offers cheap medium-term loans to UK lenders. Mortgage lenders actively price-discriminate across borrowers using two-part tariffs which split the origination fee from the interest rate. This increased after the introduction of the scheme, implying a stronger transmission of monetary policy to credit markets and the real economy.</span>

Economic growth downshifted slightly to a moderate pace in early July through August. The stronger sectors of the economy of late included manufacturing, transportation, nonfinancial services, and residential real estate. The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in a few cases, international travel restrictions. The other sectors of the economy where growth slowed or activity declined were those constrained by supply disruptions and labor shortages, as opposed to softening demand. In partic…</span>

                    <span>From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings increased to a series high of 10.9 million on the last business day of July,  the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires and total separations were little changed at 6.7  million and 5.8 million, respectively. Within separations, the quits rate was unchanged at 2.7 percent  while the layoffs and discharges rate was little changed at 1.0 percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for July, the most recent employment report was for August.
 Click on graph for larger image.
Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spikes in layoffs and discharges in March  2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings increased in July to 10.934 million from 10.185 million in June.  This is a new record high for this series.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 63% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 25% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for &quot;quits&quot;).</span>

                    <span>From the MBA: Mortgage Applications Decrease in Latest MBA Weekly Survey
Mortgage applications decreased 1.9 percent from one  week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage  Applications Survey for the week ending September 3, 2021.
... The Refinance Index decreased 3 percent from the previous  week and was 4 percent lower than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase  Index decreased 0.2 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 3 percent compared with the previous week and was 18 percent lower than the same week one year ago.
  
“Mortgage application volume fell last week to its lowest level since mid-July, as mortgage rates have  stayed just above 3% for several weeks. Refinance volume has been moderating, while purchase volume  continues to be lower than expected given the lack of homes on the market,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA&#x27;s  Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “Economic data has sent mixed signals, with slower job  growth but a further drop in the unemployment rate in August. We expect that further improvements will  lead to a tapering of Fed MBS purchases by the end of the year, which should put some upward pressure  on mortgage rates.” 
   ...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances  ($548,250 or less) remained unchanged at 3.03 percent, with points decreasing to 0.33 from 0.34 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Begin The Week Slightly Higher
Mortgage rates moved slightly higher to begin the holiday-shortened week.  ... The damage is minimal in the bigger picture.  On average, lenders are quoting the same rates seen last week, but with slightly higher closing costs today.  Most of the weakness in the underlying bond market is centered on US Treasuries as opposed to the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that serve as the foundation for mortgage rates.  The Treasury-specific weakness is likely due to the presence of several big Treasury auctions this week in addition to heavy corporate bond issuance (which tends to hurt Treasuries more than MBS).

국토 면적으로는 우리의 96배, 인구로는 27배나 되는, 중국이라는 거대한 나라를 한눈에 이해하기란 매우 어렵다. 특히나 지역 간 발전 격차가 큰 탓에 자칫하면 평균의 함정에 빠질 수밖에 없다. 중국 경제를 제대로 알기 위해 반드시 지역별 연구가 뒷받침되어야 하는 이유다. 

이런 관점에서 놀라운 성장을 거듭해온 광둥성은 중국 경제의 현재와 미래를 가늠하는 데 최적의 지역이라 할 수 있다. 실제로 광둥성은 중국 대외개방 역사의 중심지로 적극적인 개혁개방 정책과 수출 전략으로 중국 내에서 32년간 GDP 1위를 차지해왔으며, 광둥성 언론들은 곧 한국의 GDP를 추월할 것이라고 장담하고 있다.

이 책은 중국 산업과 기술의 혁신 현황을 가장 빠르게 보여주는 광둥성을 자세히 들여다보며 중국의 경쟁력이 어디에서 비롯되고 있는지를 밝히고자 한다. 특히 광저우에서 선전을 거쳐 홍콩으로 이어지는 지역을 ‘차이나 실리콘밸리’라고 이름 붙이고, 직접 찾아가 보고 들은 중국 4차 산업혁명의 현장을 담고 있다.   
사실 한국에서 중국에 대한 관심은 베이징과 상하이를 넘지 못하는 경우가 많다. 이 책은 중국 경제의 바로미터라 할 수 있는 광둥성 경제를 3년간 가장 가까이서, 가장 깊게 들여다볼 수 있었던 경험을 통해 베이징과 상하이라는 좁은 시각에서 벗어나 진짜 중국 경제의 현재와 미래를 묻고 …</span>

A rich firm-level database – matching receipt of government money with balance-sheet records, tracing payroll and turnover trajectories for the first two waves of the pandemic – was the result. This column mines that database to evaluate the incentives for accepting government aid; the impact of support measures; and heterogeneity across industries, firms, and locations.

Shock decompositions highlight the dominant role of ‘lockdown shocks’ (‘forced savings’, labour hoarding) for explaining the quarterly pattern of real GDP growth in 2020, complemented by negative contributions from foreign and investment demand notably in 2020q2 and a negative impact of persistently higher (precautionary) savings.

                    <span>The Northwest Multiple Listing Service reported Northwest MLS brokers say August housing activity follows patterns of seasonal slowing
August typically brings a dip in housing activity and this year was no different, according to representatives from Northwest Multiple Listing Service when commenting on newly-released statistics. Figures comparing July to August show month-to-month drops in new listings, total inventory, pending sales, close sales, and median prices.
&quot;August showed a more traditional seasonal pattern with decreased activity as families took end-of-summer vacations and made back-to-school preparations,&quot; remarked Frank Wilson, Kitsap regional manager and branch managing broker at John L. Scott Real Estate.
...
NWMLS statistics show the volume of new listings added during August, including single family homes and condominiums, declined from both July (down 11.5%) and twelve months ago (down 4.2%). Total inventory for the 26 counties in the report also fell, shrinking about 6.6% from July and nearly 22.6% from a year ago. At month end, there were 7,425 active listings, down from the year-ago total of 9,591.
emphasis added
The press release is for the Northwest MLS area.  There were 10,571 closed sales in August 2021, up 7.4% from 9,847 sales in July 2020.  Active inventory for the Northwest was down 22.6%.
In Seattle, sales were up 10.1% year-over-year, and inventory was down 43.9% year-over-year.  This puts the months-of-supply in Seattle at just 0.40 months.</span>

                    <span>Here is another monthly update on framing lumber prices.  
This graph shows CME random length framing futures through September 7th.

Lumber was at $680 per 1000 board feet this morning.  


This is down from a peak of $1,733, and up from $640 a year ago.

Lumber price are up 6% year-over-year.

There were supply constraints over the last year, for example, sawmills cut production and inventory at the beginning of the pandemic, and the West Coast fires in 2020 damaged privately-owned timberland (and maybe again in 2021).  


The supply constraints have eased somewhat.


And there was a huge surge in demand for lumber (demand remains strong).</span>

현재 전 세계에서 가장 영향력 있는 대표적 경제학자 중 한 명인 폴 크루그먼은, 국내 일반 독자들에게도 낯설지 않다. 1997년 발생한 아시아 외환위기를 사전에 예측하면서 국내에 널리 알려지게 되었고,  의 고정 칼럼니스트로서 현실 경제 문제에 대한 예리한 진단과 함께 정부 정책에 대한 날선 비판을 하는 그는, 스스로를 ‘현대적 진보주의자’로 부르며 현실 문제에 적극 발언하는 실천적 지식인이다. 크루그먼은 재화와 노동시장의 불안정성을 전제하며 정부 당국의 일정한 개입을 정당화하는 신케인즈주의자로 분류되고 있다.

크루그먼의 책은 국내에 20여 종 번역되어 있으나 정작 그가 어떤 성과를 인정받아 2008년 노벨 경제학상을 받았는지에 대해서는 국내에 잘 알려지지 않았다. 그의 이론이 규모의 경제와 소비자 선호의 다양성을 바탕으로 무역의 패턴과 경제활동의 지리적 분포를 설명하였다는 게 당시 수상의 이유였고, 그것이 이 책 《폴 크루그먼의 지리경제학》의 주제이다.

매일 같은 일상을 살다 보면 자신도 모르게 삶의 테두리가 줄어든다. 만나는 사람만 만나고 다니는 곳만 다니는데 심지어 유튜브 알고리즘조차 끝없이 비슷한 주제의 영상들만 추천한다. 학교에 다닐 때는 원하지 않아도 다양한 분야의 지식을 접했지만 성인이 된 후에는 관심사의 범위를 넓히기가 쉽지 않다. 그러다 보니 생각의 크기 또한 협소해지는 것이 당연하다. 

‘지금의 교양’ 시리즈는 일상적으로 사용하지만 정확한 의미를 알기 어려웠던 각 분야의 50가지 키워드를 선정해 간결하고 정확하게 설명함으로써 세부적인 것에서 출발해 전체를 보는 눈을 길러준다. 50개 키워드 하나하나가 모여 큰 틀의 지도가 완성된다. 낱낱의 지식을 쌓고 생각의 외연을 확장함으로써 지금 이 시대 내 삶에 꼭 필요한 교양을 쌓도록 돕는다.   

‘지금의 교양’ 시리즈 첫 책은 『당신이 꼭 알아야 할 자본주의 키워드 50』이다. 런던 킹스칼리지의 경제학과 교수이자 경제 전문가 조너선 포티스가 자본주의를 구성하는 50가지 핵심 키워드를 통해 자본주의란 무엇이며, 어떻게 그 안에서 사회, 문화, 역사가 촘촘하게 연결되고 발전해왔는지를 설명한다. 자본주의는 오늘날 세계 대부분 국가의 경제 체제이며 이미 우리 사회 곳곳에 스며들어 있다. 세금, 최저임금, 실업, 집값, 대출 같은 일상의 대…</span>

                    <span>The call for stricter climate change policies is gaining momentum in many countries. But despite rising public awareness, there could be political obstacles to adopting the measures needed to combat climate change. This column argues that policy design and timing are critical to overcoming political costs to climate mitigation policies, as is the need to provide effective social insurance policies. An implication is that political realities may often dictate the need to sacrifice some efficiency in climate mitigation policies in order to secure political buy-in.</span>

This column uses a global survey of almost 10,000 academic economists to find their opinions on what economic research should look like.

Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of September 3rd, inventory was at 437 thousand (7 day average), compared to 584 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 25.1%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 54%.


A week ago, inventory was at 431 thousand, and was down 27.1% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 42.7% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of 158 thousand, or about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we&#x27;d normally expect, however inventory has increased 131 thousand (close to normal).


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.</span>

지극히 평범한 보통사람 제이(J)가 2022년 한국에서 대통령이 된다는 상상 속의 가정으로부터 이 책은 출발한다. 그런데 여기저기서 ‘빵을 달라’는 외침을 마주하게 된 보통사람 제이(J)는 대한민국 국민들을 먹여 살리기 위해 빵칼을 들고 구체적으로 정부 현안들을 각 부처별로 들여다 보는 이야기이다.

 “델타 대통령의 빵칼”은 총3부로 구성되어 있는데, ‘빵칼을 들기 전에’, ‘빵칼을 들고’ 그리고 ‘빵을 달라’로 되어 있다. 모두가 본능적으로 느끼지만 말로 잘 표현하지 못하는 영역까지 이 책은 절제력을 가진 가운데 거침없이 들어간다. 더하기와 빼기의 정치력을 구체적으로 보여주는 대통령의 빵칼 암호는 델타(Delta)이다. 알파벳 D로 55개 정부 부처의 빵칼 코드를 읽어내는 흥미로움을 준다. 경제전략 정동희 작가의 10번째이자 마지막 책이다.

                    <span>Recent policy debate on minimum wages has focused not only on raising the minimum wage, but on eliminating the tip credit for restaurant workers. We use data on past variation in tip credits – or minimum wages for restaurant workers – to provide evidence on the potential impacts of eliminating (or reducing) the tip credit. Our evidence points to higher tipped minimum wages (smaller tip credits) reducing jobs among tipped restaurant workers, without earnings effects on those who remain employed sufficiently large to raise total earnings in this sector. And most of our evidence provides no indication that higher tipped minimum wages would be well targeted to poor or low-income families or reduce the likelihood of being poor or very low income.</span>

                    <span>Although there is a large gap between Black and White American life expectancies, the gap fell 48.9% between 1990-2018, mainly due to mortality declines among Black Americans. We examine age-specific mortality trends and racial gaps in life expectancy in rich and poor U.S. areas and with reference to six European countries. 
Inequalities in life expectancy are starker in the U.S. than in Europe. In 1990 White Americans and Europeans in rich areas had similar overall life expectancy, while life expectancy for White Americans in poor areas was lower.  But since then even rich White Americans have lost ground relative to Europeans. Meanwhile, the gap in life expectancy between Black Americans and Europeans decreased by 8.3%.  
Black life expectancy increased more than White life expectancy in all U.S. areas, but improvements in poorer areas had the greatest impact on the racial life expectancy gap. The causes that contributed the most to Black mortality reductions included: Cancer, homicide, HIV, and causes originating in the fetal or infant period.  
Life expectancy for both Black and White Americans plateaued or slightly declined after 2012, but this stalling was most evident among Black Americans even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. If improvements had continued at the 1990-2012 rate, the racial gap in life expectancy would have closed by 2036. European life expectancy also stalled after 2014. Still, the comparison with Europe suggests that mortality rates of both Black and White Americans could fall much further across all ages and in both rich and poor areas.</span>

                    <span>Goods and services---public housing, medical appointments, schools---are often allocated to individuals who rank them similarly but differ in their preference intensities. We characterize optimal allocation rules when individual preferences are known and when they are not. Several insights emerge. First-best allocations may involve assigning some agents &quot;lotteries&quot; between high- and low-ranked goods. When preference intensities are private information, second-best allocations always involve such lotteries and, crucially, may coincide with first-best allocations. Furthermore, second-best allocations may entail disposal of services. We discuss a market-based alternative and show how it differs.</span>

                    <span>During the financial crisis apparently centralized markets continued to function while trade in OTC markets froze. We use search-and-bargaining theory to ascertain conditions that allow trade to temporarily freeze in decentralized markets, focusing on the roles of liquidity and self-fulfilling prophecies. We show standard models can have recurrent, belief-driven hot and cold spells, but not freezes and thaws. A simple specification that has freezes assumes negative returns. A more realistic one incorporates information frictions (costly asset-quality verification). Another uses different frictions to get credit freezes. We also discuss policy implications, and go into detail on the nature of OTC markets.</span>

                    <span>We study how risk management through hedging impacts firms and competition among firms in the life insurance industry - an industry with over 7 Trillion in assets and over 1,000 private and public firms. We show that firms that are likely to face costly external finance increase hedging after staggered state-level financial reform that reduces the costs of hedging. Post reform impacted firms have lower risk and fewer negative income shocks. Product market competition is also impacted. Firms that previously are more likely to face costly external finance, lower price, increase policy sales and increase their market share post reform. The results are consistent with hedging allowing firms that face potential costly financial distress to decrease risk and become more competitive.</span>

                    <span>Over the past decade, rising youth use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has prompted aggressive regulation by state and local governments. Between 2010 and 2019, ten states and two large counties adopted ENDS taxes. Applying a continuous treatment difference-in-differences approach to data from two large national datasets (Monitoring the Future and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System), this study explores the impact of ENDS taxes on youth tobacco use. We find that ENDS taxes reduce youth e-cigarette consumption, with estimated e-cigarette tax elasticities of -0.06 to -0.21. However, we estimate sizable positive cigarette cross-tax elasticities, suggesting economic substitution between cigarettes and e-cigarettes for youth. These substitution effects are particularly large for frequent cigarette smoking. We conclude that the unintended effects of ENDS taxation may more than fully offset any public health gains.</span>

                    <span>Adoption of health information and communication technologies (“HICT”) has surged over the past two decades. We survey the medical and economic literature on HICT adoption and its impact on clinical outcomes, productivity and labor.  We find that HICT improves clinical outcomes and lowers healthcare costs, but (i) the effects are modest so far, (ii) it takes time for these effects to materialize, and (iii) there is much variation in the impact. More evidence on the causal effects of HICT on productivity is needed to guide further adoption. There is little econometric work directly investigating the impact of HICT on labor, but what there is suggests no substantial negative effects on employment and earnings. Overall, while healthcare is “exceptional” in many ways, we are struck by the similarities to the wider findings on ICT and productivity stressing the importance of complementary factors (e.g. management and skills) in determining HICT impacts.</span>

                    <span>We develop a theory to account for changes in prices of risky and safe assets and gross and net capital flows over the global financial cycle (GFC). The multi-country model features global risk-aversion shocks and heterogeneity of investors both within and across countries. Within-country heterogeneity is needed to account for the drop in gross capital flows during a negative GFC shock (higher global risk-aversion). Cross-country heterogeneity is needed to account for the differential vulnerability of countries to a negative GFC shock. The key vulnerability is associated with leverage. In both the data and the theory, leveraged countries (net borrowers of safe assets) deleverage through negative net outflows of risky assets and positive net outflows of safe assets, experience a rise in the current account and a greater than average drop in risky asset prices. The opposite is the case for non-leveraged countries (net lenders of safe assets).</span>

                    <span>This paper examines inequalities in the match between student and degree quality using linked administrative data from schools, universities and tax authorities. We analyse two measures of match at the university-subject level: undergraduate enrollment qualifications, and graduate earnings. We find for both that disadvantaged students match to lower quality degrees across the entire distribution of achievement, in a setting with uniform fees and a generous financial aid system. While there are negligible gender gaps in academic match, high-attaining women systematically undermatch in terms of expected earnings, driven by subject choice. These inequalities in match are largest among the most undermatched.</span>

Following the initiation of suspicious splits, share prices temporarily increase, and subsequently decline below their pre-split levels. Using account level data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we find that small retail investors acquire shares in firms initiating suspicious splits, while more sophisticated investors accumulate positions before suspicious split announcements and sell in the post-split period. We also find that insiders sell large blocks of shares and obtain loans using company stock as collateral around the initiation of suspicious splits.</span>

                    <span>Investing in college carries high returns, but comes with considerable risk. Financial products like equity contracts can mitigate this risk, yet college is typically financed through non-dischargeable, government-backed student loans. This paper argues that adverse selection has unraveled private markets for college-financing contracts that mitigate risk. We use survey data on students&#x27; expected post-college outcomes to estimate their knowledge about future outcomes, and we translate these estimates into their implication for adverse selection of equity contracts and several state-contingent debt contracts. We find students hold significant private knowledge of their future earnings, academic persistence, employment, and loan repayment likelihood, beyond what is captured by observable characteristics. For example, our empirical results imply that a typical college-goer must expect to pay back $1.64 in present value for every $1 of equity financing to cover the financier&#x27;s costs of covering those who would adversely select their contract. We estimate that college-goers are not willing to accept these terms so that private markets unravel. Nonetheless, our framework quantifies significant welfare gains from government subsidies that would open up these missing markets and partially insure college-going risks.</span>

                    <span>Although an extensive literature shows that startups are financially constrained and that constraints vary by geography, the source of these constraints is still relatively unknown. We explore intermediary financing constraints, a channel studied in the banking literature, but only indirectly addressed in the venture capital (VC) literature. Our empirical setting is the VC fundraising and startup financing environment around the passage of the Volcker Rule, which restricted banks’ ability to invest in venture capital funds as limited partners (LPs). The rule change disproportionately impacted regions of the U.S. historically lacking in VC financing. We find that a one standard deviation increase in VCs’ exposure to the loss of banks as LPs led to an 18% decline in fund size and about a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow-on fund. Startups were not completely cushioned from the additional constraints on their VCs: capital raised fell and pre-money valuations declined. Overall, VC financing constraints manifest as fewer, smaller funds that change investment strategy and experience increases in bargaining power. Last, we show that the rule change increased the likelihood startups move out of impacted states, thus exacerbating the geographic disparity in high-growth entrepreneurship.</span>

                    <span>We study the design of macroprudential policies based on quantitative collateral-constraint models. We show that the desirability of macroprudential policies critically depends on the specific form of collateral used in debt contracts: While inefficiencies arise when current prices affect collateral---a frequent benchmark used to guide policies---they do not when only future prices affect collateral. Since the microfoundations and quantitative predictions of models with future-price collateral constraints do not appear less plausible than those using current prices, we conclude that additional empirical work is essential for the use of these models in macroprudential policy design.</span>

                    <span>With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, small business lending through fintech lenders collapsed. We explore the reasons for the market shutdown using detailed data about loan applications, offers, and take-up from a major small business fintech credit platform. We document that while the number of loan applications increased sharply early in March 2020, the supply of credit collapsed as online lenders dropped from the platform and the likelihood of applicants receiving loan offers fell precipitously. Our analysis shows that the drying up of the loan supply is most consistent with fintech lenders becoming financially constrained and losing their ability to fund new loans.</span>

                    <span>There is wide dispersion in pharmaceutical prices across countries with comparable quality standards. Under monopoly, off-patent and generic drug prices are at least four times higher in the United States than in comparable English-speaking high income countries. With five or more competitors, off-patent drug prices are similar or lower. Our analysis shows that differential US markups are largely driven by the market power of drug suppliers and not due to wholesale intermediaries or pharmacies. Furthermore, we show that the traditional mechanism of reducing market power – free entry – is limited because implied entry costs are substantially higher in the US.</span>

                    <span>In many developed countries, real wage growth has lagged behind labour productivity growth in recent decades. This column uses data from Japan and Korea to study the relationship between labour productivity growth, real wage growth, and labour’s terms of trade, defined as the ratio of the consumer price index to the GDP deflator. It shows that the main reason for the real wage-labour productivity growth gap is a large decline in labour’s terms of trade. Raising real wages in the future will require policies to support the business environment and develop high value-added sectors.</span>

                    <span>Note: I&#x27;m tracking data for many local markets around the U.S.  I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.

From the DMAR: Monthly Indicators, August 2021


Total Residential Units Sold in August 2021 were 5,618, down 15.1% from 6,615 in August 2020.


Active Residential Listings in August 2021 were 3,582, down 11.7% from last month, and down 34.8% from 6,449 in August 2020.

 
New Residential Listings in August 2021 were 6,109, down 14.6% from last month, and down 10.1% from 6,794 in August 2020.


Inventory in Denver had been fairly steady over the last 6 or 7 years, but declined sharply in 2020.  This is still the lowest level of inventory for August on record.


From DMAR: DMAR Real Estate Market Trends Report | SEP. &#x27;21
Keeping in trend with traditional seasonality, the transition from July to August felt like a shift as vacations slowed down in preparation for the school year and fall. Buyers are more willing to be patient in order to find the right house for the “right” price. The report saw this reflected in the days in MLS, which increased from nine to 11 in August 2021. Likewise, the close-price-to-list-price ratio dipped ever so slightly month-over-month. In a dramatic data point, the month-end active inventory dropped 11.69 percent. Historically speaking, the change in inventory is relatively consistent from July to August. 
  
However, with both inventory and new listings decreasing, the short-lived “loose grip” on inventory has tightened once again. Months of inventory decreased from the previous month to 0.637. The report also indicated that if no one were to put a property on the market for 19 days, there would be nothing to sell in the entire Denver Metro area.
emphasis added
Active inventory in Denver is up 87% from the record low in March 2021.</span>

“중국은 음모, 협작, 기망 등이 지저분하게 판치는 곳이다. 우리가 이를 반칙이라 생각하여 페어플레이를 고수한다면 우리는 그들에게 파트너도 적도 될 수 없다. 옹졸하고 비겁하며 영악한 강자와의 게임에서 우리는 내내 패배하고 있었다.” 저자가 ‘프롤로그’에서 밝힌 중국 비즈니스에 대한 진단이다.

이 책에서 소개하는 40가지의 사례들을 보면 중국 시장이 녹록은커녕 자칫하면 구렁텅이에 빠질 수 있다는 사실을 실감하게 된다. 물론 예전부터 이랬던 것은 아니다. 2006년까지만 해도 중국은 미국과 동일할 정도로 한국인들이 호감을 느끼는 국가였고, 우리에게 아주 친절하고 풍족하며 만만한 시장이었다. 중국인은 우리의 일상생활을 선망하고 대중문화에 열광하던 두껍고 너그러운 지갑의 소유자였다. 이런 상황은 사드발 한한령을 경계로 일변한다. 

이 책은 저자가 직간접적으로 겪은 중국 비즈니스의 다양한 사례로부터 필승 노하우의 핵심을 추려낸 것이다. 중국인과 중국 비즈니스의 민낯을 넘어 본질 그 구석구석까지 파헤쳐놓은 한중 비즈니스의 해부학 교재라고 지칭할 만하다. 

상대를 잘 파악하여 합리성에 기반한 냉철한 이성으로써 사업하는 것과, 무지한 낙관과 우리 사회에서나 통용될 법한 정의감 등의 잣대로 임하는 것은 천양의 차이로 귀결한다. 중국과의 사업에서 결핍해서는 안 될 태도와 필수 지식이 해학, 분노, 감동, 충격 등 흥미진진한 이야기를 통해 전수된다. 이길 수 있는 진짜배기 정보를 현장감 있는 에피소드를 통해 얻을 수 있는 것은 이 책만의 강점이다.

                    <span>The headline unemployment rate of 5.2% significantly understates the current situation. 

Here is a table that shows the current number of unemployed and the unemployment rate (as of August 2021). 
  
Then I calculated the unemployment rate by including the number of people that have left the labor force since early 2020, and the expected growth in the labor force.

As the economy recovers, many of the people that left the labor force will probably return, and there will likely be more entrants into the labor force (although recent demographic data has been dismal).
  
It would be a mistake to just look at the headline unemployment rate to assess the current situation.</span>

                    <span>The 2021 victory of Pedro Castillo as president of Peru is commonly attributed to the support of poor, rural, and indigenous groups. However, profound historical factors also played a role. In particular, areas where colonial rule was more ruthless in the 18th century – as measured by the expected returns to office, the tax burden, and the intensity of anti-colonial rebellions – exhibited higher support for Castillo in 2021. Interestingly, this support is not visible for other leftist and Marxist parties in the elections of 1980 and 1985.</span>

Intermodal is navigating many of the same  challenges that have plagued global supply chains for  months, such as shutdowns at ports and manufacturing  centers in Asia; port congestion; labor and capacity  shortages at docks, warehouses, and drayage firms;  container and chassis shortages; natural and man-made  disasters (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and ships getting  stuck in canals). Pressures are intensifying as retailers,  many of whom already have much lower inventories  than they’d like, are trying to stock up for the upcoming  holiday season. At this point, no one knows if things will  get worse before they get better, and if they do get  worse, how much worse the…</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 31st.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances Tick Down, With All Eyes on September Exits
The final week of August brought a 53,000 decline in the number of active forbearance plans, driven by a 23,000 reduction in plans among FHA/VA loans. Plan volumes also improved from the week prior among both GSE (-20,000) and portfolio/PLS (-10,000) loans.
  
According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, as of August 31, 1.71 million borrowers remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, including 1.8% of GSE, 5.6% of FHA/VA and 4.0% of portfolio held and privately securitized mortgages.
This puts plan volumes down nearly 9% (-168,000) from the same time last month as the market braces for the large wave of final plan expirations taking place in September. Of the 629,000 plans slated to be reviewed for extension/removal this month, nearly 400,000 are set to reach their final plan expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

Significant volume declines could be seen in coming weeks as those plans reach their final expirations and exiting borrowers return to making mortgage payments in October.

                    <span>The headline jobs number in the August employment report was well below expectations, however employment for the previous two months was revised up significantly.   The participation rate was unchanged and the unemployment rate decreased to 5.2%.

Leisure and hospitality was unchanged in August, probably due to the sharp increase in COVID cases.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 1.7 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back almost 79% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment decreased 3 thousand, and manufacturing added 37 thousand jobs.


NOTE: State and Local education lost 26 thousand jobs, seasonally adjusted, versus expectations of a solid gain.

We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 500k in August, below consensus of +725k. ... we expect the reopening of schools to boost job growth by around 150k in tomorrow’s report. ... We estimate a two-tenths drop in the unemployment rate to 5.2% ... reflecting a firm household employment gain and a stable participation rate.

이벤트: 이 달의 문장 투표




코로나19 이후 증시가 V자 반등을 하면서 주식을 처음 접한 개인투자자들이 많아졌다. 대한민국에 이토록 주식 열풍이 분 적은 없었다. 코인도 마찬가지이다. 현재 서점에서 팔리고 있는 투자 서적은 500여 권. 그런데 주가 조작이 횡행하는 주식시장에서 개인투자자가 실제 도움을 받을 만한 책은 없다. 저자는 아무도 알려주지 않는 작전 세력에 대해 제대로 알려주어, 개인투자자들이 정보의 비대칭을 극복하는 데 도움을 주고자 한다. 

이 책은 투자를 공부할 때 활용하는 PBR, PER과 같은 보조지표를 다루지 않는다. 그런 정보라면 이미 많은 책이 존재한다. 일반인이 합법과 불법 사이를 오가며 줄타기를 하는 작전 세력의 움직임을 알기란 참으로 어렵다. 개인은 자본력도 정보력도 뒤떨어지기 때문이다. 그러나 세력은 흔적을 남긴다. 

이 책은 그 흔적을 하나하나 보여준다. 잘 살피고 속지 말자. 세력의 매집 차트, 작전 세력의 의도, 실행, 결과까지 실증 데이터를 기반으로 전 과정을 파헤친다. 세력의 흔적을 찾아내는 7가지 요소 즉 매집 차트, N자 파동, 작업 세력, 전환사채와 유상증자, 작전 과정 그리고 코인 시장에서의 작전 등으로 정리해 누구나 쉽게 이해하고 적용해 볼 수 있다.

블록체인 기술에 기반한 신산업혁명을 이끌어가는 경제주체들을 하나하나 추적하며 블록체인 기술이 무엇인지, 어떻게 코인시장에 참여하고 이끌어가는지 파헤친다. 이론이 아니라 경제주체들의 행적을 좇아가며 신산업혁명의 실체에 접근한다.

코인시장은 한 나라 한 지역이 아닌 지구 행성을 하나의 시장으로 24시간 작동한다. 이 시장을 움직이는 주체는 누구일까? 비트코인이 법정화폐로 등장하고 미국 대통령 후원자는 암호화폐 친화적 기업과 투자은행이다. 애플과 아마존은 디파이 시장에 뛰어들었다. 독일 부유층과 기관투자자의 자금이 암호화폐 시장으로 흘러들어간다.

JP모건, 골드만삭스 등 세계적 투자은행은 암호화폐 투자상품 계획을 잇달아 내놓는다. 우리나라의 삼성, 한화, 그리고 테크기업 네이버, 카카오도 앞다투어 블록체인 기술에 투자하며 암호화폐를 발행한다. 이들이 코인시장을 만들어가는 주체들이다. 2020년 한 해 수익률은 이더리움과 비트코인을 따라올 자가 없었다. 이 주체들을 하나하나 만나볼 것이다.

                    <span>There has been a spate of critiques of mainstream, neoclassical economics in the last few years. This column argues that this is partly the result of a core general model that is too narrow. Instead, the authors propose a base model that includes not just the economy but also the socioeconomic system. The model encompasses many specific themes in the literature such as the interplay between economic inequality and efficiency, but it also takes us well beyond the conventional economic resource allocation-based perspective on inequality.</span>

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 8.4% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: Seasonality, Pandemic Continue To Weigh Down Weekly US Hotel Performance
U.S. hotel performance continued to decline from previous weeks, according to STR‘s latest data through August 28.
August 22-28, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 61.0% (-8.4%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $131.91 (+3.2%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $80.53 (-5.5%)
Performance continues to reflect seasonality as well as the pandemic situation. Additionally, while data for August 27-28 showed a preliminary demand shift in the Gulf region, the impact of Hurricane Ida is expected to be more significant in future weeks of data. 
...
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.

The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, occupancy is declining due to both seasonal factors and the &quot;pandemic situation&quot;.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - especially with the sharp increase in COVID pandemic cases and hospitalizations.</span>

The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
After April 2020, sales increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic).

                    <span>How many lives could be saved if rich countries shared their vaccines? Less than 2% of people in low-income countries have received even one dose. Mehdi Benatiya Andaloussi tells Tim Phillips about his calculation of how many lives would be saved by the end of 2021 if vaccines were shared more fairly - and how many have been lost because this hasn&#x27;t happened so far.

                    <span>The emergence of new Covid-19 variants and a highly uneven vaccine rollout have put mask mandates back on the policy agenda. This column presents new evidence that state-level mask mandates reduced new weekly COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths significantly in the US. The results imply that 87,000 lives were saved up until 19 December 2020, while an additional 58,000 lives could have been saved if all states had put in place a mandate starting in April 2020. Mask mandates had a greater effect in counties more positively inclined towards mask wearing.</span>

Construction spending during July 2021 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,568.8 billion, 0.3 percent above the revised June estimate of $1,563.4 billion. The July figure is 9.0  percent above the July 2020 estimate of $1,439.6 billion.

Private and public spending increased:
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,231.0 billion, 0.3 percent above the revised June estimate of $1,227.8 billion. ...
In July, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $337.8 billion, 0.7 percent above the revised June estimate of $335.6 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 14% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 10% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been weak recently.
Public construction spending is 4% above the peak in March 2009, and 29% above the austerity low in February 2014, but weak recently.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 27.0%.  Non-residential spending is down 3.6% year-over-year.  Public spending is down 5.1% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service in most areas and did not decline sharply like many other sectors, but some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 29.8% YoY, multi-retail down 3.4% YoY, and office down 6.1% YoY.

This was at consensus expectations of a 0.3% increase in spending, and construction spending for the previous two months was revised up slightly.</span>

                    <span>From ADP:
Private sector employment increased by 374,000 jobs from July to August according to the August ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly distributed to the public each  month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from ADP’s actual payroll data,  measures the change in total nonfarm private employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
“Our data, which represents all workers on a company’s payroll, has highlighted a downshift in the labor  market recovery. We have seen a decline in new hires, following significant job growth from the first half  of the year,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP. “Despite the slowdown, job gains are  approaching 4 million this year, yet still 7 million jobs short of pre-COVID-19 levels. Service providers  continue to lead growth, although the Delta variant creates uncertainty for this sector. Job gains across  company sizes grew in lockstep, with small businesses trailing a bit more than usual.”
  
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said, “The Delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have  dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job  growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.
emphasis added
  This was well below the consensus forecast of 638,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 728 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in August.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.</span>

지난 160년 동안 지구상의 인구는 두 배에서 두 배, 거기서 또 거의 두 배로 늘어났다. 전 세계 1인당 GDP는 실질 가치로 따져도 10배 이상 증가했고, 말(馬)을 이동 수단으로 삼던 인류는 로켓을 타고 우주여행을 떠나기에 이르렀다. 속도를 높이는 세상에서 낙오하지 않기 위해 안간힘을 쓰는 것은 삶의 당연한 방식이었다.

그러나 이제 모든 것이 속도를 줄이기 시작했다. 여전히 앞으로 나아가고 있지만 나아가는 속도는 예전만 못하다. 단편적 시선으로는 알아차리기 힘들지만 여러 가지 거대한 지표가 변화의 감속 경향을 나타내고 있다. 인구도 경제도 기술도 사상의 발전도 서서히 속도를 줄이고 있다. 스마트폰이 대단한 혁신인양 떠들어대지만 전화, 컴퓨터, 인터넷이 처음 출현했을 때와 비교하면 소소할 뿐이다. 

책은 감속 중인 세계의 모습을 방대한 데이터와 입체적인 그래프를 통해 보여 준다. 흥미롭게도 감속, 즉 슬로다운은 많은 측면에서 긍정적으로 해석된다. 성장이 둔화됨에 따라 자본주의의 기세가 꺾이고 경제는 안정되며 부의 불평등이 완화되고 환경오염 문제도 줄어들 것이다. 지은이는 대가속 시대의 종말로 훨씬 인간적인 세상이 도래할 것이라고 예견한다. 속도를 줄인다는 것은 곧 빠르고 치열하게 살지 않아도 된다는 뜻이기 때문이다.

                    <span>The ECB signalled an historic shift in its 2020 strategy review. This column introduces a new CEPR report which argues that the review has moved the ECB in the right direction but leaves some key issues unaddressed. The report focuses on the definition of the ECB’s inflation target, its operational framework, fiscal and monetary policy interactions, and the implications for monetary policy of climate change and related mitigation initiatives. The authors identify topics to be addressed in future strategic reviews and provide a framework as a basis for this ongoing analysis.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 shock exerted pressure on labour markets around the world. This column explores how the prevalence of immigration in the labour market affected different types of workers’ exposure to virus-related risks in 15 destination countries in Western Europe. It finds that not only were immigrant workers more vulnerable to the economic and health shocks of the pandemic; they also served as a protective shield for native workers. By undertaking higher-risk occupations, immigrants enabled native workers to move into work with fewer face-to-face interactions or jobs that could be carried out from the safety of home.</span>

                    <span>Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in July was 1.74%, down from 1.86% in June.  Freddie&#x27;s rate is down year-over-year from 3.12% in July 2020.
Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.15%, unchanged from 0.15% in June, and down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.</span>

These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.

By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 4.82% are seriously delinquent (down from 5.04% in June).  For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 8.26% are seriously delinquent (down from 8.75%),  For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.57% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.69%). So Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.

                    <span>Reis reported the office vacancy rate was at 18.5% in Q2, up from 18.2% in Q1, and up from 17.1% in Q2 2020. 


This is the highest vacancy rate for offices since the early &#x27;90s (following the S&amp;L crisis).
Click on graph for larger image.
The first graph shows the office vacancy rate starting in 1980 (prior to 1999 the data is annual).

The office vacancy rate was elevated prior to the pandemic, and has moved up significant overly the last several quarters. And will likely increase further as leases expire.

Reis also reported that office effective rents declined in Q2; the fifth consecutive quarter with declining rents.
The second graph shows the regional and strip mall vacancy rate starting in 1980 (prior to 2000 the data is annual).
For Neighborhood and Community malls (strip malls), the vacancy rate was 10.5% in Q2, down from 10.6% in Q1, and up from 10.2% in Q2 2020.
For Regional malls, the vacancy rate was 11.5% in Q2, up from 11.4% in Q1, and up from 9.8% in Q2 2020.


Reis reported that mall effective rents stabilized in Q2, after declining for four consecutive quarters.

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Fall Back to 3 week Lows
Mortgage rates drifted lower again today, with the average lender getting back down to the lowest levels since the first week of August.  In a general sense, today&#x27;s friendly rate momentum represented follow-through momentum after Fed Chair Powell soothed the market on Friday morning.
...
Specifically, the labor market needs to show that it can weather the various storm cycles of the pandemic.  To that end, there are several upcoming reports that can offer some clarity with this Friday&#x27;s jobs report being the most important.  In other words, even if the Fed doesn&#x27;t have anything new to say this week, an exceptionally strong jobs report could easily push rates back up. [30 year fixed 2.91%]

영국의 마르크스주의 경제학자이자 런던 금융가(시티)에서 수십 년간 경제 전문가로 일한 지은이가 코로나19가 강타한 세계경제의 현 상태를 설명하고, 위기에 대응하려는 각종 대안과 정책을 마르크스주의 관점에서 날카롭게 분석하는 책이다.

이 책은 한국에서도 활발하게 전개되고 있는 논의와 관련 깊은 주제를 다룬다. 최신의 케인스주의뿐 아니라 현대화폐론처럼, 최근 좌파 사이에서 떠오른 대안(가령 일자리 보장제)의 근거가 되는 이론을 면밀하게 살펴본다. 독점이 경제 위기의 원인인지(즉, 독점 또는 재벌을 규제하면 되는지), 인공지능이 일자리를 빼앗을 것인지, 경기 침체 속에서도 왜 주가는 뛰는지, 정부의 경기 부양이 먹힐지 등 경제 핫이슈를 어렵지 않게 풀어낸다. 

또 토마 피케티나 데이비드 하비처럼 한국에서도 상당히 주목받는 좌파 경제학자의 기여와 함께 한계도 살펴보면서, 마르크스 《자본론》의 혁명적 함의가 여전히 오늘날에도 유의미함을 분명하게 제시하는 것은 무엇보다 두드러진 이 책의 장점이다.

지금의 위기가 어디서 비롯한 것이고 어떻게 끝날 수 있는지 고민하는 독자들이 여러 논의의 이론적 배경과 국제적 논쟁점을 더 넓은 시야로 파악하는 데 이 책이 도움이 될 것이다.

엮은이 말 
한국어판 머리말 

1부 코로나19와 세계경제
지금의 경제 위기가 단지 코로나19 때문일까? 
코로나19 팬데믹 후에 V형 회복이 될까? 
장기 불황으로 들어선 세계경제 

2부 독점, 인공지능, 주식, 경기 부양: 마르크스주의로 보기
독점: 불평등과 저성장의 원인일까? 
인공지능 로봇: 일자리를 빼앗을까? 
주식: 경제는 침체인데 왜 뛸까? 
경기 부양책: 경제를 살릴 수 있을까? 

3부 경제 위기 원인과 대안 논쟁
현대화폐론: 돈을 찍어 경제를 살릴 수 있을까? 
케인스주의: 긴축의 진정한 대안이 될 수 있을까? 
데이비드 하비: 이윤율 저하 경향의 법칙이 경제 위기를 설명 못 하나? 
토마 피케티: 자본 수익률은 자본주의 핵심 모순을 짚지 못한다

                    <span>Though R&amp;D is a key driver of productivity growth, the effects of immigration on R&amp;D investment remain poorly understood. This column investigates the impact that a large immigration shock – in this case, the sudden influx of migrants to Norway following the 2004 enlargement of the EU – had on R&amp;D investments. The results suggest that immigration shocks can have a negative impact on a receiving country’s R&amp;D investments, with potentially long-term consequences for productivity growth.</span>

                    <span>Note: This is as of August 22nd.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Remains Unchanged at 3.25%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance remained  unchanged relative to the prior week at 3.25% as of August 22, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.6 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance remained the same relative to the prior  week at 1.66%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance also remained the same at 3.92%, while the  forbearance share for portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) increased 3 basis points to 7.18%. The percentage of loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers increased 2 basis points to 3.50%, and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers was unchanged at 3.35%.
“The share of loans in forbearance changed little once again this week, as both new requests and exits  remained at a slow pace,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “We  expect a sharp increase in forbearance exits over the next month as many borrowers reach the 18- month mark and see their forbearance plans end. For those borrowers who have exited in August, the  majority either enter deferral plans or obtain modifications.”

I&#x27;ve started a newsletter focused solely on real estate.  This newsletter will be ad free.

The current article discusses existing home inventory (a key topic this year).

This newsletter will usually be published several times a week, and will provide more in-depth analysis of the housing market.

                    <span>Reis reported that the apartment vacancy rate was at 5.3% in Q2 2021, unchanged from 5.3% in Q1, and up from 4.9% in Q2 2020.   The vacancy rate peaked at 8.0% at the end of 2009, and bottomed at 4.1% in 2016.

This graph shows the apartment vacancy rate starting in 1980. (Annual rate before 1999, quarterly starting in 1999). Note: Reis is just for large cities.
The vacancy rate has increased somewhat from the low in 2016.

There are other surveys that suggest the apartment market has tightened recently.   The NMHC reported that their market tightness index hit an all time high in July. There are other indicators that suggest the vacancy rate is moving lower.

                    <span>Tracking existing home inventory will be very important this year.
Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of August 27th, inventory was at 431 thousand (7 day average), compared to 592 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 27.1%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 56%.


A week ago, inventory was at 422 thousand, and was down 27.3% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 40.7% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we&#x27;d normally expect, however inventory has increased (as a percentage) more than normal.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now above the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.</span>

                    <span>From the NAR: Pending Home Sales Wane 1.8% In July
Pending home sales dipped modestly in July, noting two consecutive months of declines, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Only the West region registered a month-over-month gain in contract activity, while the other three major U.S. regions reported drops. All four regions saw transactions decrease year-over-year.
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, declined 1.8% to 110.7 in July. Year-over-year, signings fell 8.5%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI fell 6.6% to 92.0 in July, a 16.9% decrease from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index dropped 3.3% to 104.6 last month, down 8.5% from July 2020.
Pending home sales transactions in the South declined 0.9% to an index of 130.9 in July, down 6.7% from July 2020. The index in the West rose 1.9% in July to 99.8, but still down 5.7% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was below expectations of a 0.4% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in August and September.</span>

2008년 글로벌 금융위기 이후 전 세계는 현재의 승자독식 자본주의가 만들어내는 극심한 빈부격차 문제에 주목했다. 이에 사회적경제가 새로운 대안으로 떠올랐다. 사회적경제는 시장경제의 효율성을 살리면서도 실업·빈곤 등 경제·사회 문제까지 극복할 수 있어 포용적 성장이 가능하기 때문이다. 

EU는 이미 2009년에 사회적경제 개념인식·법적조치 권고 등 48개 항목의 ‘사회적경제에 관한 결의문’을 채택했으며, 2015년 기준 EU에서의 사회적경제기업 고용 비중은 6.5%다. 우리나라 역시 1997년 외환위기 이후 부처별로 사회적경제 지원정책을 마련해 자활기업, 사회적기업, 마을기업, 협동조합, 소셜벤처 등 다양한 사회적경제기업이 활동 중이다. 또 2017년에는 정부에서 일자리위원회 관계부처 합동으로 ‘사회적경제 활성화 방안’을 발표했으며, 기획재정부의 장기전략국에 사회적경제과가 설치되었다. 이처럼 우리 사회에서 중요한 이슈로 떠오른 ‘사회적경제’에 대해 이 책은 우리에게 친근한 영화와 TV 드라마를 끌어와 보다 쉽게 설명하고자 한다.

진정한 ‘경알못(경제를 알지 못하는 사람)’들을 위해 탄생했던 도서 《모르면 호구 되는 경제상식》이 2021년 최신 개정판으로 출간되었다. 《모르면 호구 되는 경제상식》은 초판이 출간된 해에 ‘세종도서 교양부문 도서’로 선정되며 콘텐츠의 우수성을 입증, 제대로 된 경제상식 입문서를 찾는 독자들에게 지금까지 꾸준한 사랑을 받아왔다. 

이 책의 가장 큰 미덕은 금융·재테크부터 트렌드·시사상식까지 살아가는 동안 꼭 필요한 최소한의 경제상식들만 살뜰하게 한 권에 담아냈다는 것이다. 그동안 너무 어렵고 낯선 경제 용어와 장황한 서술 때문에 ‘경제’라고 하면 진저리를 쳤을 독자들이라도 이 책만큼은 끝까지 ‘완독’할 수 있을 것이다. 그만큼 우리 일상에서 쓰는 용어들로 경제 개념과 원리들을 차근차근 친절하게 풀어냈기 때문이다. 

머리 아픈 경제 공부는 싫지만, 몰라서 손해 보는 것은 더 싫고, ‘호구’ 소리 듣는 것은 더욱 끔찍이 싫은 독자라면 일단 이 책의 첫 장부터 넘겨보자. 마지막 페이지를 덮을 때쯤이면 나 자신을 지킬 수 있는 최소한의 무기를 갖출 수 있을 것이다.

맑스와 엥겔스의 시대부터 미국의 버니 샌더스, 영국 노동당의 지도자 제레미 코빈에 이르기까지 사회주의라는 이념을 내세우며 역사적으로 등장했던 다양한 정치 운동의 역사를 검토하고, 미국적 맥락에서 앞으로의 ‘사회주의 운동’이 나아가야 할 길을 제시하고 있다.

                    <span>This study provides a structural analysis of detailed, alternating-offer bargaining data from eBay, deriving bounds on buyers and sellers private value distributions using a range of assumptions on behavior. These assumptions range from very weak (assuming only that acceptance and rejection decisions are rational) to less weak (e.g., assuming that bargaining offers are weakly increasing in players&#x27; private values). We estimate the bounds and show what they imply for consumer negotiation behavior in theory and practice. For the median product, bargaining ends in impasses in 43% of negotiations even when the buyer values the good more than the seller.</span>

                    <span>The Value of Statistical Life (VSL) is arguably the most important number in benefit-cost analyses of environmental, health, and transportation policies.  However, agencies have used a wide range of VSL values.  One reason may be the embarrassment of riches when it comes to VSL studies.  While meta-analysis is a standard way to synthesize information across studies, we now have multiple competing meta-analyses and reviews.  Thus, to analysts, picking one such meta-analysis may feel as hard as picking a single &quot;best study.&quot;  This paper responds by taking the meta-analysis another step, estimating a meta-analysis (or mixture distribution) of six meta-analyses.  The baseline model yields a central VSL of $7.0m, with a 90% confidence interval of $2.4m to $11.2m.  The provided code allows users to easily change subjective weights on the studies, add new studies, or change adjustments for income, inflation, and latency.</span>

                    <span>The path of income inequality in post-reform China has been widely interpreted as “China’s Kuznets curve.” We show that the Kuznets growth model of structural transformation in a dual economy, alongside population urbanization, has little explanatory power for our new series of inequality measures back to 1981. Our simulations tracking the partial “Kuznets derivative” of inequality with respect to urban population share yield virtually no Kuznets curve. More plausible explanations for the inequality turning points relate to determinants of the gap between urban and rural mean incomes, including multiple agrarian policy reforms. Our findings warn against any presumption that the Kuznets process will assure that China has passed its time of rising inequality. More generally, our findings cast doubt on past arguments that economic growth through structural transformation in poor countries is necessarily inequality increasing, or that a turning point will eventually be reached after which that growth will be inequality decreasing.</span>

                    <span>While formal mentorship programs are ubiquitous, less is known about who gains from receiving mentorship. In this paper, we report the outcome of a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) carried out in a US-based inbound sales call center where one branch of the experiment assigned a random subset of new hires to mentors (Broad-Mentoring), whereas a second branch (Selective-Mentoring) gave new hires the opportunity to opt into a mentoring relationship before assigning a random subset to mentors. In the Broad-Mentoring branch, mentored sales agents outperformed non-mentored agents by over 18% in the first six months on the job. Among agents who opt into the program in the Selective-Mentoring branch, those who received mentorship had negligible performance gains. The differences between the two branches indicates that formal mentorship program treatment effects are largest for workers who would otherwise opt out of these programs. Demographic and personality characteristics are relatively weak predictors of selection into the program, suggesting broad-based programs are likely more effective than alternative targeting rules.</span>

                    <span>We show that cities with higher population density specialize in high-skill service jobs that can be done remotely. The urban and industry bias of remote work potential shaped the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic impact. Many high-skill service workers started to work remotely, withdrawing spending from big-city consumer service industries dependent on their demand. As a result, low-skill service workers in big cities bore most of the recent pandemic’s economic impact. Our findings have broader implications for the distributional consequences of the U.S. economy’s transition to more remote work.</span>

                    <span>This chapter discusses recent developments in the literature involving applications of industrial organization methods to finance. We structure our discussion around a simple model of a financial intermediary that concentrates its attention either on (i) the retail market and hence engages in a traditional maturity transformation business by accepting funds that can be used to invest in risky projects (loans), or (ii) the investment business, financing its operations on the “wholesale” market and making markets or investing in higher return riskier projects. Our discussion is centered around the analysis of market structure and competition in each of these markets, focusing in turn on (i) primary and secondary markets for government and corporate debt, (ii) interbank loans, (iii) markets for retail funding, and (iv) credit markets, including mortgages.</span>

                    <span>Imperfections in risk and capital markets imply that individuals who lose jobs suffer from imperfect smoothing of consumption across states and times. Compared to the first best, there will be too little search. Optimal unemployment programs, which balance the marginal benefit of consumption smoothing vs. the marginal cost of the insurance externality, increase welfare and may even increase GDP. Our analytical results suggest that welfare is higher if the unemployment benefits program includes income-contingent unemployment loans (ICL), where the amount repaid depends on the individual’s future income. Such loans can be financed by a risk premium imposed on the unemployed who avail themselves of the loans, and partially substitute for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. Optimal unemployment benefits programs (UB) with ICL do a better job of smoothing consumption across states and time, and in particular total benefits when unemployed increase. We analyze how changes in key parameters, such as the degree of risk aversion and the nature of post-employment work, affect the design of the optimal UB program and the magnitude of the incremental benefits from including income-contingent loans.</span>

                    <span>Do central banks rebalance their currency shares? The answer matters because the dollar’s predominant role in large official reserve holdings means that widespread rebalancing requires central banks to buy (sell) a depreciating (appreciating) dollar, stabilising its value against other major currencies. We hypothesise that larger reserve holdings have led central banks to approach their investment more systematically and to make rebalancing in the face of exchange rate changes the norm. We illustrate the choice with two polar case studies: the US clearly does not rebalance its small FX reserves; Switzerland does rebalance its very large reserves, so that changes in exchange rates do not move its currency allocation. Our hypothesis finds partial support in global aggregated data. They reject both no rebalancing and full rebalancing and point to emerging market economies as the source of the aggregate result. We also test for rebalancing with panel data and find that our sample economies on average again behave in intermediate fashion, partially but not fully rebalancing. However, when observations are weighted by the size of reserves, the panel analysis finds full rebalancing. A variety of control variables and splits of the panel sample do not alter the thrust of these findings. Central banks rebalance their FX reserves extensively but not uniformly.</span>

                    <span>Since the mid-1900s, agricultural global value chains (AGVCs) have grown rapidly and transformed the nature of agri-food production around the world. Little is known, however, about how participation in AGVCs changes the structure of participating economies. Using a constructed panel dataset from 155 countries for the period 1991-2015, I find that, in response to high AGVC participation, both GDP and employment shares in the agricultural and services sectors increase, and that both factors decrease in the manufacturing sector. Counter to conventional wisdom about structural transformation, I uncover evidence that modern agrarian economies are leapfrogging the manufacturing sector to directly develop their agriculture and services sectors through their participation in AGVCs.</span>

Westminster court decision on long-run educational attainment for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in California. Our identification strategy relies on comparing individuals across California counties that vary in their likelihood of segregating and across birth cohorts that vary in their exposure to the Mendez court ruling based on school start age.

                    <span>Using data from 56 nations over 45 years, we find that nations that are more likely to elect left wing governments face higher (and more volatile) sovereign spreads. To explain these facts, we build a sovereign default model in which two policymakers (left and right) alternate in power. The probability of an incumbent staying in power is increasing in the share of government spending. We parametrize the left policymaker as having a higher marginal political gain from increasing government spending than the right does, a feature found in our data. Model economies in which the left is more frequently in power face worse borrowing terms due to higher default risk, a greater reluctance for fiscal austerity in bad times, and a higher share of government spending on average. These features imply large welfare losses for households.</span>

                    <span>I propose a financial channel of wage rigidity. In recessions, rather than propping up marginal (new hires’) costs of labor, rigid average wages squeeze cash flows, forcing firms to cut hiring due to financial constraints. Indeed, empirical cash flows and profits would turn acyclical if wages were only moderately more procyclical. I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires’ wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations—breaking the neutrality of incumbents’ wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.</span>

Combining French accounting, customs, and patent information at the firm-level, we show that the horizontal shock is detrimental to firms’ sales, employment, and innovation. Moreover, this negative impact is concentrated on low-productivity firms. By contrast, we find a positive effect - although often not significant - of the vertical shock on firms’ sales, employment, and innovation.</span>

We solve a representative investor&#x27;s optimal asset allocation and derive the resulting conditional equity premium and risk-free rate in equilibrium. Our empirical analysis shows that the equity premium appears to be earned for facing uncertainty, especially high uncertainty that is disconnected from lower volatility, rather than for facing volatility as traditionally assumed. Incorporating the possibility of a disconnect between volatility and uncertainty significantly improves portfolio performance, over and above the performance obtained by conditioning on volatility only.</span>

                    <span>In a textbook New Keynesian model extended to allow for uninsurable household income risk, any path of inflation and output implementable via interest rate policy is similarly implementable through uniform lump-sum transfers (&quot;stimulus checks&quot;). A dual-mandate policymaker can thus use checks to perfectly substitute for conventional monetary policy when rates are constrained by a lower bound. In a quantitative heterogeneous-agent (HANK) model, the stimulus check policy that implements a given monetary allocation is well-characterized by a small number of measurable sufficient statistics. In the household cross-section, the transfer policy is associated with lower consumption inequality than the equivalent rate cut.</span>

                    <span>Official statistics on deaths in India during the COVID pandemic are either incomplete or are reported with a delay.  To overcome this shortcoming, we estimate excess deaths in India using the household roster from a large panel data set, the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey, which reports attrition from death.  We address the problem that the exact timing of death is not reported in two ways, via a moving average and differencing monthly deaths.  We estimate roughly 4.5 million (95% CI: 2.8M to 6.2M) excess deaths over 16 months during the pandemic in India.  While we cannot demonstrate causality between COVID and excess deaths, the pattern of excess deaths is consistent with COVID-associated mortality.  Excess deaths peaked roughly during the two COVID waves in India; the age structure of excess deaths is right skewed relative to baseline, consistent with COVID infection fatality rates; and excess deaths are positively correlated with reported infections.  Finally, we find that the incidence of excess deaths was disproportionately among the highest tercile of income-earners and was negatively associated with district-level mobility.</span>

                    <span>Across a broad range of equipment types and industries, we document a pattern of local capital reallocation from older firms to younger firms.  Start-ups purchase a disproportionate share of old physical capital previously owned by more mature firms.  The evidence is consistent with financial constraints driving differential demand for vintage capital.  The local supply of used capital influences start-up entry, job creation, investment choices, and growth, particularly when capital is immobile.  Conversely, incumbents accelerate capital replacement in the presence of more young firms.  The evidence suggests previously undocumented benefits to co-location between old and young firms.</span>

                    <span>Who is harmed by and who benefits from worker reallocation?  We investigate the earnings consequences of changing jobs and find a wide dispersion in outcomes. This dispersion is driven not by whether the worker was displaced, but by the duration of joblessness between job spells. Job movers who experience joblessness suffer a persistent reduction in earnings and tend to move to lower-paying firms, suggesting that job ladder models offer a useful lens through which to understand the negative consequences of job separations.</span>

                    <span>We investigate how material well-being has changed over time for single mother headed families—the primary group affected by welfare reform and other policy changes of the 1990s. We focus on consumption as well as other indicators including components of consumption, measures of housing quality, and health insurance coverage. The results provide strong evidence that the material circumstances of single mothers improved in the decades following welfare reform. The consumption of the most disadvantaged single mother headed families—those with low consumption or low education—rose noticeably over time and at a faster rate than for those in comparison groups.</span>

                    <span>Vaccination rates have a statistically significant downward effect on the Covid-19 death rate across US counties, as of August 12, 2021. Controlling for poverty rates, age, and temperature lowers the magnitude of the estimate a little. Using the Biden-Trump vote in the 2020 election as an instrument for vaccination rates raises the magnitude of the estimate. Presumably it corrects for a positive effect of observed local Covid deaths on the decision to get vaccinated. Overall, the estimated beneficial effect holds up and has risen over time.</span>

                    <span>We document the extent, nature, and consequences of survey errors in cash welfare and SNAP receipt in three major U.S. household surveys. We find high rates of misreporting, particularly failure to report receipt. The surveys inaccurately capture patterns of multiple program participation, even though there is little evidence of program confusion. Error rates are higher among imputed observations, which account for a large share of false positive errors. Many household characteristics have significant effects on both false positives and false negative errors. Error rates sharply differ by race, ethnicity, income and other household characteristics.  The errors greatly affect models of program receipt and estimated effects of income and race are noticeably biased. We examine error due to item non-response and imputation, as well as whether imputation improves estimates. Item non-respondents have higher receipt rates than the population conditional on covariates. The assumptions for consistent estimates in multivariate models fail both when excluding item non-respondents and when using the imputed values.  In binary choice models of program receipt, linked data estimates favor excluding item non-respondents rather than using imputed values. Biases are well predicted by the error patterns we document, helping researchers make informed decisions on whether to use imputed values.</span>

                    <span>The rapid diffusion and use of new ideas are critical for advancing and realizing the value of innovation. This paper explores the impact of demographic characteristics of innovators and potential adopters on the adoption of important new scientific ideas through networks. Using rich, population-level data on the biomedical researchers and their networks, natural language processing, and a novel two-way fixed effects strategy, we find that new ideas introduced by female scientists are under-utilized, which can be explain by two factors. First, female innovators are not as well-connected in networks; second, even at a short network distances, researchers (especially men) are less likely to adopt women’s ideas. Ideas from underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities are also less widely used.</span>

                    <span>Millions of people are being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 every day, but the virus is also mutating and spreading fast. Vaccine production is increasing, but supply still constrains vaccinations worldwide. Using lower doses of vaccines could dramatically accelerate vaccination. Available evidence on efficacy is not dispositive but suggests half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could be almost as effective as currently-used doses. Even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses, an epidemiological model suggests they could significantly reduce total infections and deaths. The social value of testing dwarfs the costs. However, firms do not internalize the full social value, a market failure that could be addressed with public funding. Governments could support either experimental or observational evaluations of fractional dosing.</span>

                    <span>The food supply chain has experienced major disruptions from both demand and supply sides during the Covid-19 pandemic. While some consequences such as food waste are directly caused by the disruption due to supply chain inefficiency, others are indirectly caused by a change in consumer’s preferences. As a result, evaluating food supply chain resilience is a difficult task. With an attempt to understand impacts of demand on the food supply chain, we developed an agent-based model based on the case of Idaho’s potato supply chain. Results showed that not only the magnitude but also the timing of the demand shock will have different impacts on various stakeholders of the supply chain. Our contribution to the literature is two-fold. First, the model helps explain why food waste and shortages may occur with dramatic shifts in consumer demand. Second, this paper provides a new angle on evaluating the various mitigation strategies and policy responses to disruptions beyond Covid-19.</span>

                    <span>Labour productivity is more procyclical in OECD countries with lower employment volatility. To capture this new stylised fact, this column proposes a business cycle model with employment adjustment costs, variable hours, and labour effort. In the model with variable effort, it shows that greater labour market frictions are associated with procyclical labour productivity as well as stable employment. In contrast, the constant-effort model fails to replicate the observed cross-country pattern in the data. Labour market deregulation has a greater effect on labour productivity cyclicality and employment volatility when effort can vary.</span>

The huge spikes in energy prices during the oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 are obvious.  As is the increase in energy prices during the 2001 through 2008 period. 
In general, energy expenditures as a percent of PCE have been trending down for years.
At the beginning of the pandemic, energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE, fell to a record low of 3.3% in May 2020.


In July 2021,  energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE had rebounded and were at 4.0% of PCE.  This is slightly above the pre-pandemic level in early 2020.</span>

                    <span>The BEA released the Personal Income and Outlays, July 2021 report yesterday.   The report showed that government transfer payments were still almost $1.0 trillion (on SAAR basis) above the February 2020 level (pre-pandemic)  Note: Seasonal adjustment doesn&#x27;t make sense with one time payments, but that is how the data is presented.  

This table shows the amount of unemployment insurance and &quot;Other&quot; transfer payments since January 2020 (pre-crisis level).  The increase in &quot;Other&quot; was mostly due to parts of the relief acts including direct payments.

Note: Not in the table below, but Social Security and Medicare payments haven&#x27;t increased significantly from the pre-recession levels.  Social Security increased from $1,065 billion SAAR in Jan 2020 to $1,113 billion SAAR in July 2021.  Medicare increased from $807 billion to $821 billion.  Medicaid increased significantly from $603 billion to $760 billion.


But most of the increase in transfer payments - compared to the levels prior to the crisis - is from unemployment insurance and &quot;other&quot; (includes direct payments).

                    <span>Recent discussions on how to regulate dominant online platforms revolve around the suitability of applying existing regulatory frameworks. This column contrasts the economic and strategic features of platform business models to those of utility industries, which are often considered structurally similar. It argues that the design of effective regulation for dominant digital platforms should account for platforms’ nature as an ecosystem of independent actors and for their relatively shorter innovation cycles.</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 24th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Familiar Midmonth Uptick in Forbearances
Continuing the same mid-month trend we also noted last week, the number of active forbearance plans edged slightly higher once again.
  
According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, there are now 1.76 million borrowers who remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans as of August 24, including 1.9% of GSE, 5.8% of FHA/VA and 4.1% of portfolio held and privately securitized mortgages.
The overall number of active forbearances rose by 12,000 since last Tuesday, driven primarily by a 10,000 increase in plans among portfolio/PLS loans. FHA/VA volumes also rose – though a more modest 3,000 – with GSE plans seeing the week’s only decline (-1,000).
Click on graph for larger image.
  
This puts plan volumes down 132,000 from the same time last month for a 7% decline. More than 150,000 plans are slated for review for extension or removal through the final week of August, so there is still some opportunity for modest improvement yet this month.
That number ramps up to nearly 670,000 for September, though, with 415,000 of those plans set to reach their final expiration next month based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

That brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for monetary policy. The Committee remains steadfast in our oft-expressed commitment to support the economy for as long as is needed to achieve a full recovery. The changes we made last year to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address today&#x27;s challenges.
We have said that we would continue our asset purchases at the current pace until we see substantial further progress toward our maximum employment and price stability goals, measured since last December, when we first articulated this guidance.

                    <span>The Japanese economy has seen a decline in the contribution of capital accumulation to economic growth since 2000. This column uses over 30 years of national productivity data to explore this trend. It finds that the fall in tangible capital accumulation has largely been offset by investment into intangible capital. However, the growth in tangible and intangible capital accumulation has been imbalanced, calling for support of both types of asset accumulation.</span>

July marked the strongest visitation month since the pandemic began as the destination hosted 3.3M visitors, up 11.2% MoM and down ‐10.4% from July 2019.
Hotel occupancy continued to ramp up, exceeding 79% (up 3.5 pts MoM, down ‐11.7 pts vs. July 2019), as Weekend occupancy came in at 88.1% (down ‐1.3 pts MoM) while Midweek occupancy increased to 74.6% (up 3.7 pts MoM, down ‐14.1 pts vs. July 2019.)
ADR came in very strong during the month, reaching $152, surpassing last month by 19%, and RevPAR beat comparable 2019 monthly levels for the first time as it reached $120.79, up +24.4% MoM and 4.5% ahead of July 2019.

The first graph shows visitor traffic for 2019 (blue), 2020 (orange) and 2021 (red).

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 9.1% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Performance Continues Decline in Mid-August
Reflecting seasonal demand patterns and concerns around the pandemic, U.S. hotel performance continued to decline from previous weeks, according to STR‘s latest data through August 21.
August 15-21, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 63.7% (-9.1%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $135.77 (+5.1%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $86.43 (-4.5%)
While none of the Top 25 Markets recorded an occupancy increase over 2019, Detroit came closest to its 2019 comparable (-0.7% to 69.3%).
...
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, occupancy is declining due to both seasonal factors and &quot;concerns around the pandemic&quot;.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - especially with the sharp increase in COVID pandemic cases and hospitalizations.</span>

                    <span>From the BEA: Gross Domestic Product, 2nd Quarter 2021 (Second Estimate); Corporate Profits, 2nd Quarter 2021 (Preliminary Estimate)
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the second quarter of 2021, according to the &quot;second&quot; estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the first quarter, real GDP increased 6.3 percent.
The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the &quot;advance&quot; estimate issued last month. In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 6.5 percent. The update reflects upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and exports that were partly offset by downward revisions to private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, were revised down 
emphasis added
Here is a Comparison of Second and Advance Estimates.  PCE growth was revised up from 11.8% to 11.9%. Residential investment was revised down from -9.8% to -11.5%. This was slightly below the consensus forecast.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic and the imposed social distancing restrictions represented an unprecedented shock for the world economy and caused a marked increase in uncertainty. Based on a new firm-level survey matched with balance-sheet information, this column presents new evidence from Spain on the asymmetric impact of the pandemic shock. The impact of the Covid-19 shock was larger in the case of small and less productive firms within each sector and region. However, the unexpected announcement of the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine significantly improved the prospects of faster recovery under different sets of measures.</span>

                    <span>Localised innovation policies, such as local R&amp;D clusters, are very popular, yet the evidence about their effectiveness is scarce in the short run, let alone the long run.   This column fills the gap by studying the long-run effects of a historic localised place-based innovation policy in the form of Russian science cities. It finds that in present-day Russia, science cities remain more innovative and productive, host more highly skilled workers, and pay them higher salaries.</span>

                    <span>From the Philly Fed: 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has released the coincident indexes for the 50 states for July 2021. Over the past  three months, the indexes increased in 48 states, decreased in one state, and remained stable in one, for a three-month  diffusion index of 94. Additionally, in the past month, the indexes increased in 46 states, decreased in one state, and remained stable in three, for a one-month diffusion index of 90. For comparison purposes, the Philadelphia Fed has also  developed a similar coincident index for the entire United States. The Philadelphia Fed’s U.S. index increased 1.9 percent  over the past three months and 0.8 percent in July.
emphasis added
Note: These are coincident indexes constructed from state employment data.  An explanation from the Philly Fed: 
The coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state’s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state’s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.

Here is a map of the three month change in the Philly Fed state coincident indicators.  This map was all red during the worst of the Pandemic and also at the worst of the Great Recession.
The map is almost all positive on a three month basis.

And here is a graph is of the number of states with one month increasing activity according to the Philly Fed. 

This graph includes states with minor increases (the Philly Fed lists as unchanged).
In July, 48 states had increasing activity including minor increases.</span>

                    <span>Some interesting information from the REALTORS® Confidence Index Survey July 2021
Several metrics indicate that demand is cooling in a moderately strong market. With limited supply in the  market, homes typically sold within 17 days (22 days one year ago). The REALTORS® Buyer Traffic Index decreased further from 71 in June to 64 in July (moderately strong conditions) while the REALTORS® Seller  Traffic Index remains below 50 which is “weak” traffic compared to the level one year ago. On average, a home  sold had more than 4 offers, for which remains unchanged from last month’s survey. REALTORS® expect home  prices in the next three months to increase nearly 2% from one year ago compared to 4% outlook in last  month’s survey. Respondents expect sales in the next three months to decrease 1% from last year’s sales level  compared to the 1% outlook in last month’s survey.

This map, from the July NAR report, shows buyer traffic is mostly &quot;moderately strong&quot; just about everywhere.
This is less demand than last month, and significantly less than a few months ago. 
As the NAR noted: &quot;demand is cooling in a moderately strong market&quot;.
 The second map is from the April report.
In April, buyer traffic was very strong just about everywhere.
There has also been a shift in seller traffic, with more traffic in many states (compare map from April on page 3 to the map from July also on page 3).</span>

지금 우리는 이전과는 완전히 다른 세계를 맞이하고 있다. 그리고 이 세계는 우리가 지금까지 진리와 상식으로 믿어왔던 투자 공식을 파괴하며 혼돈을 키우고 있다. 과학과 기술의 발전으로 시간의 가치가 감소하며, 다양한 요소들의 합으로 불확실성과 우연이 일상화가 되는 사회를 복잡계라고 한다. 앞으로 미래에는 하나의 현상에 하나의 원인만 존재하는 것이 아니라 여러 가지 요소들이 복합적으로 작용하여 우리는 결과를 예측하기 어려운 사회를 살아가게 될 것이다. 

타이거자산운용 오종태 투자전략 이사는 2008년 글로벌 경제위기 이후 기존의 방식으로는 설명되지 않는 경제와 투자 세계를 바라보며 복잡계에 대해 연구했고, 이를 투자에 접목시켜 큰 수익을 창출했다. 업계에서는 투자의 숨은 고수로 불렸지만 방송 출연은 전무했다. 

하지만 2021년 4월 「삼프로TV」에서 복잡계 투자를 소개하며 단 1회 방송만으로 ‘레전드 강의’라는 폭발적 반응을 일으켰고, 방송에서는 말하지 못했던 복잡계 이론을 한 권의 책에 압축해 담았다. 지금의 복잡계의 흐름을 과학, 정치, 경제의 사건으로 짚어보며, 복잡계가 바꾸고 있는 투자의 미래, 그리고 복잡계에서 살아남기 위해 필요한 투자 지침까지 이 책을 통해 지금까지 알고 있던 투자의 공식을 바꾸고 새로운 투자 세계에서 살아남을 수 있는 가이드라인을 얻을 수 있을 것이다.

저자의 말 점점 더 복잡해지는 삶과 투자에 대해 이야기해봅시다

1부 영원히 변화하는 세계

수용하기 벅찬 변화의 가속
지식이 지식의 근거가 되는 세상의 종말
명료함의 독에 빠지지 말자
변화하지 않는 삶은 이제 존재하지 않는다
삶의 방식과 사고 구조의 대전환이 필요하다
변화의 폭을 넓히고 싶다면?
세상을 복잡계로 바라보는 인디언처럼

단순계와 복잡계
탐구가 중요한 단순계, 변화가 중요한 복잡계
절대 진리가 발전시킨 서양의 단순계
복잡계 세상을 이해하는 데 동양이 서양보다 유리하다?
복잡계를 이해하려는 서양의 시도들

우연을 다루다
합리화의 수단으로 사용된 우연
우연을 예측하는 것은 가능할까?
앞으로의 우연에 대처할 우리의 자세

복잡계에 단순계를 적용하는 지금의 현실
외부가 아닌 내부에 집중하라
복잡계 선두에 설 저력이 충분한 대한민국
단순계에서 복잡계 사고 구조로 바꾸려면?
복잡계의 이해 방식을 받아들이는 삶

멀티 &amp; 메타, 멀티 vs. 메타
공존하면서도 대치하는 멀티와 메타
포함되면서도 분리되는 멀티, 경계가 없는 메타
스스로 모든 것을 만드는 메타버스의 탄생
과학 기술이 만드는 메타 세계
각개전투는 그만, 협동을 통해 시너지를 낸다
경제학적 관점보다 생태학적 관점이 주목받는 시대가 온다

투자 vs. 투기
함께하는 Nom, 활용하는 Nom, 사기 치는 Nom
투자는 제로섬이 아닌 윈-윈 게임이다
하나만 선택할 이유는 없다

2부 복잡계의 탄생과 지금, 복잡계를 이해하는 법

이해의 구조를 이해하는 법
데이터, 정보, 지식, 지혜, 직관의 이해 과정
틀리지도 못하는 삶에서 벗어나자
지혜로운 사람은 ‘내가 모른다’는 사실을 늘 인지한다
생각은 우리의 몸도 바꾼다
인간은 불확실한 정보를 가지고도 결론을 내릴 수 있다
복잡계 3의 법칙

단순계의 경제 구조와 투자 방식
2에서 3, 다시 2로 돌아온 계층 구조
구조에 대한 해석은 시대에 따라 달라진다
단순계의 기초가 되는 사이클 이론
사이클의 발생과 대응에 집중했던 단순계 경제 구조
단순계로 판단...

NFT는 ‘Non-Fungible Token(대체불가 토큰)’의 약자로, 미술, 음악, 게임, 부동산 등 유·무형의 다양한 자산들의 소유권과 거래내역을 블록체인에 저장한 디지털 파일이다. 1:1 맞교환이 가능한 기존 화폐나 암호화폐 등과 달리 NFT는 각각의 자산이 고윳값을 지녀 ‘상호 대체가 불가’하고 원본임을 증명할 수 있으며 희소성이 있다. 일반인도 쉽게 거래할 수 있고, 현금화도 가능하다. ‘자산’의 가치를 인정받으며 투자 수단으로도 떠오르는 이유다. 

게다가 종류도 활용도 무궁무진하다. 디지털 세상에만 존재하는 자산(디지털 미술 작품, 디지털 음반, 모바일 이벤트 티켓 등)과 실물로 존재하는 자산(갤러리에 전시된 작품, 금, 빌딩 등)은 물론, 개념적 자산(투표권, 관심이나 주목, 평판 등) 모두 블록체인상에 NFT로 제작하고 거래할 수 있다. 최근에는 현실 세상을 너머 가상 세계인 메타버스에서 NFT가 경제 시스템으로 작동하면서 더욱 주목받고 있다.

플러터의 기초부터 고급 활용법까지 다루어 다양한 영역에서 실용적으로 앱을 만드는 방법을 소개한다. 특별히 HTTP 통신이나 네이티브 소스와 연동하는 방법, 파이어베이스를 이용해 서버 없이 데이터를 저장하거나 불러오고, 앱 사용자 분석, 푸시 알림을 보내는 방법도 다룬다. 

그뿐만 아니라 내가 만든 앱에 광고를 넣어 수익을 얻을 수 있는 방법까지 소개한다. 그리고 마지막에는 이 책에서 다룬 기술을 응용해 &#x27;모두의 여행&#x27;이라는 관광 정보 앱을 만든다. 이때 한국관광공사가 제공하는 공공 데이터를 이용해 보면서 누구나 쓸 만한 앱을 만들어 볼 수 있다 .

                    <span>Political polarisation can have significant effects on economic behaviour and political effectiveness. This column presents key trends in US political polarisation and discusses their implications. It shows that polarisation (1) has been increasing since the 1980s, (2) has grown at similar rates across different age groups, and (3) has increased more in the US relative to many other developed countries. Potential determinants for these trends in US political polarisation include racial divisions, elite polarisation, and cable TV news consumption.</span>

                    <span>As part of the new home sales report released this morning, the Census Bureau reported the number of homes sold by price and the average and median prices.
From the Census Bureau: &quot;The median sales price of new houses sold in July 2021 was $390,500.  The average sales price was $446,000.&quot;
The following graph shows the median and average new home prices.
 Click on graph for larger image.
During the housing bust, the builders had to build smaller and less expensive homes to compete with all the distressed sales.  When housing started to recovery - with limited finished lots in recovering areas - builders moved to higher price points to maximize profits.

Then the average and median house prices mostly moved sideways since 2017 due to home builders offering more lower priced homes.  Prices picked up during the pandemic, and really picked up recently.
The average price in July 2021 was a record $446,00, up 18% year-over-year.  The median price was a record $390,500, up 18% year-over-year.  
The second graph shows the percent of new homes sold by price.
Very few new homes sold were under $200K in July 2021 (about 1.6% of all homes).  This is down from 56% in 2002.  In general, the under $200K bracket is going away.    
The $400K and greater than $500K+ brackets increased significantly over the last decade.  


Half of new homes (about 50% in July) in the U.S., are in the $200K to $400K range.  The fastest growing price segment over the last 2 years has been the $400K to $500K range.</span>

                    <span>New home sales for July were reported at 708,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis (SAAR). Sales for the previous three months were revised up, combined.
This was somewhat above consensus expectations for July, but still down 27.2% year-over-year - since sales increased sharply following the early months of the pandemic.  The new home sales rate is now slightly below the pre-pandemic level of around 740 thousand (the three months previous to pandemic). 


Earlier: New Home Sales Increase to 708,000 Annual Rate in July.

This graph shows new home sales for 2020 and 2021 by month (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
The year-over-year comparisons were easy in the first half of 2021 - especially in March and April.
However, sales will likely be down year-over-year for the remainder of 2021 - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
And on inventory: note that completed inventory (3rd graph in previous post) is near record lows, but inventory under construction is closer to normal.
This graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction.
  
The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 36 thousand in July, just above the record low of 33 thousand in March, April and May 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (just above the record low).

The inventory of new homes under construction is at 3.8 months - slightly above the normal level.


However, a record 105 thousand homes have not been started - about 1.8 months of supply - about double the normal level.</span>

The previous three months were revised up, combined. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in July 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 1.0 percent above the revised June rate of 701,000, but is 27.2 percent below the July 2020 estimate of 972,000.

By abstaining on Friday, the average lender was forced to adjust today&#x27;s rates slightly higher to account for the bond market weakness.  In other words, this morning&#x27;s rates were higher than Friday morning&#x27;s.
As the day progressed, mortgage bonds improved enough for a friendly mid-day reprice.  A majority of lenders pulled the trigger, thus helping rates close the gap with Friday&#x27;s rates.  Simply put, rates started the day moderately higher versus Friday morning, but are now only marginally higher (assuming the lender in question offered a mid-day price improvement).  ...

한국의 대표적 빅테크 기업 카카오와 네이버의 블록체인 경쟁이 점점 치열해지고 있다. 수십억 원을 글로벌 블록체인에 기업에 투자하는 것은 물론 그라운드X, 라인플러스 등 블록체인 자회사의 규모도 키우는 중이다. 카카오 그라운드X가 승기를 잡은 한국은행 디지털 원화 사업(CBDC)도 그동안 카카오의 블록체인 투자가 결실을 맺은 순간이었다. 이렇듯 블록체인은 단순히 가상화폐 기반 기술이 아니라 미래 산업을 이끄는 기업들은 반드시 갖춰야 하는 필수 기술이 된 것이다.

IT 전문 포럼 커넥팅랩이 새롭게 출간한 《블록체인 트렌드 2022-2023》은 금융, 유통, IoT, 콘텐츠 분야에서 급속도로 발전한 블록체인 산업 현황을 상세하게 담아냈다. 특히 금융에서는 코로나19 이후 재편된 금융 플랫폼의 변화를 다뤘다. 비대면 거래가 일상화되자 토스, 렌딧 등 핀테크 기업들이 한 단계 더 성장했고 카카오, 네이버 등 빅테크 기업들이 블록체인 기술로 무장해 호시탐탐 기존 은행의 자리를 노리고 있다.

또한 콘텐츠 분야에서의 변화도 눈에 띈다. 네이버 제페토, 로블록스 등 메타버스 플랫폼이 인기를 끌면서 블록체인이 현실세계와 가상세계를 잇는 기술적 가교역할을 하고 있다. 유통, IoT 분야에서도 블록체인의 발전으로 중개기관의 역할이 축소되고 거래 속도…</span>

핵심만 쏙쏙 담은 생활밀착형 인공지능 입문서. 인공지능을 실제 사례를 중심으로 그 내용을 풀어가며 해설하여, 이해도와 응용력을 높임과 동시에 인공신경망과 딥러닝의 큰 틀과 원리를 이해할 수 있도록 구성하였다. 인공지능이 일상에서 어떻게 활용될 수 있는지 생활 속 예제들을 통해 살아있는 인공지능을 느낄 수 있도록 하였다.  

기존의 인공지능 또는 인공지능 수학 도서는 단원별 목차에 맞춘 개념 해설과 풀이가 대부분이었다. 이 경우 전체적 이해도와 응용력이 떨어질 수밖에 없다. 이 책은 을 통해 전체적인 흐름을 파악할 수 있게 도와주고, 실생활을 인공지능 모델로 바꾸고, 직접 학습해 보는 실습 예제를 반복 학습을 통해 익힐 수 있도록 풀이 과정을 모듈화하였다.

파이썬의 기초적인 지식만 있으면 누구든 이 책을 통해 본격적인 인공지능 학습이 가능하다. 특히 인공신경망 학습의 핵심인 경사하강법과 오차역전파법에 대해서는 어떤 교재보다도 알기 쉽게 설명하였다. 또한 이 책은 많은 도서에 포함된 실습용 예제 코드를 실행하면서 어려움을 겪었던 학습자에게 실패하지 않는 비법을 전수하고자 했다. 각 프로그램의 버전을 알려주는 대로 설치하기만 하면 모든 예제 코드가 오류 없이 실행되는 즐거움을 맛볼 수 있다…</span>

                    <span>Digitalization of Money is a crossroad in monetary history. Advances in technology has led to the development of new forms of money: virtual (crypto) currencies like bitcoin; stable coins like libra/diem; and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) like the Bahamian sand dollar. These innovations in money and finance have resonance to earlier shifts in monetary history: 1) The shift in the eighteenth and nineteenth century from commodity money (gold and silver coins) to convertible fiduciary money and inconvertible fiat money; 2) the shift in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from central bank notes to a central bank monopoly; 3) Then evolution since the seventeenth century of central banks and the tools of monetary policy. 

This paper analyzes the arguments for a CBDC through the lens of monetary history. The bottom line is that the history of transformations in monetary systems suggests that technical change in money is inevitably driven by the financial incentives of a market economy. Government has always had a key role in the provision of outside money, which is a public good. Government has also regulated inside money provided by the private sector. This held for fiduciary money and will likely hold for digital money. CBDC could make monetary policy more efficient, and it could transform the international monetary and payments systems.</span>

                    <span>The regulated insurance exchanges set up in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were designed to deliver affordable, efficient health coverage through private insurers. It is crucial to study the complex industrial organization (IO) of these exchanges in order to assess their impacts to date, during the first decade of the ACA, and in order to project their impacts going forward. We revisit the inherent market failures in health care markets that necessitate key ACA exchange regulations and investigate whether they have succeeded in their goals of expanding coverage, creating robust marketplaces, providing product variety, and generating innovation in health care delivery. We discuss empirical IO research to date and also highlight shortcomings in the existing research that can be addressed moving forward. We conclude with a discussion of IO research-based policy lessons for the ACA exchanges and, more generally, for managed competition of private insurance in health care.</span>

                    <span>Road maintenance constitutes a significant component of public transportation spending at all levels of government. Formulation of efficient transportation infrastructure policy requires information about factors affecting road and traffic conditions. We generate the first causal evidence that decreasing pavement quality impacts vehicle crash rates and decreases average speed. Results from Instrumental Variable models using spatially and temporally disaggregated data from Federal-Aid Highway System (FAHS) roads in California show statistically and economically significant increases in vehicle crash rates and decreases in average vehicle speed caused by road damage. These impacts imply significant increases in social costs attributable to road damage.</span>

                    <span>Unemployment is notoriously difficult to predict.  In previous studies, once country fixed effects are added to panel estimates, few variables predict changes in unemployment rates.  Using panel data for 29 European countries over 439 months between 1985 and 2021 in an unbalanced country*month panel of just over 10000 observations, we predict changes in the unemployment rate 12 months in advance based on individuals’ fears of unemployment, their perceptions of the economic situation and their own household financial situation.  Fear of unemployment predicts subsequent changes in unemployment 12 months later in the presence of country fixed effects and lagged unemployment.  Individuals’ perceptions of the economic situation in the country and their own household finances also predict unemployment 12 months later. Business sentiment (industry fear of unemployment) is also predictive of unemployment 12 months later.  The findings underscore the importance of the “economics of walking about”. The implication is that these social survey data are informative in predicting economic downturns and should be used more extensively in forecasting.  We also generate a 29 country-level annual panel on life satisfaction from 1985-2020 from the World Database of Happiness and show that the consumer level fear of unemployment variable lowers well-being over and above the negative impact of the unemployment rate itself.  Qualitative survey metrics were able to predict the Great Recession and the economic slowdown in Europe just prior to the COVID19 pandemic.</span>

                    <span>Using large-scale survey data covering more than 110 countries and exploiting within-country variation across cohorts and surveys, we show that individuals with longer exposure to democracy display stronger support for democratic institutions.  We bolster these baseline findings using an instrumental-variables strategy exploiting regional democratization waves and focusing on immigrants’ exposure to democracy before migration.  In all cases, the timing and nature of the effects are consistent with a causal interpretation.  We also establish that democracies breed their own support only when they are successful: all of the effects we estimate work through exposure to democracies that are successful in providing economic growth, peace and political stability, and public goods.</span>

                    <span>We present both theory and evidence that increased competition may decrease rather than increase consumer welfare in subprime credit markets. We present a model of lending markets with imperfect competition, adverse selection and costly lender screening. In more competitive markets, lenders have lower market shares, and thus lower incentives to monitor borrowers. Thus, when markets are competitive, all lenders face a riskier pool of borrowers, which can lead interest rates to be higher, and consumer welfare to be lower. We provide evidence for the model’s predictions in the auto loan market using administrative credit panel data.</span>

                    <span>This survey examines recent developments in economic research relating to antitrust, paying specific attention to research in the areas of collusion and merger enforcement.   Research relating to both collusion and mergers has made significant advances in the last twenty years. With respect to collusion, this includes important theoretical and empirical work on the sustainability, structure, and impact of collusive schemes. With respect to mergers, this includes important work on the impact of enforcement institutions, both theoretical and empirical work on unilateral effects, and theoretical work on the selection of which mergers get proposed to antitrust agencies and optimal policy in the face of that selection. A feature of recent research is the increasing complementarity between empirical work (ranging from observational studies to model-based measurement) and theoretical work in advancing our understanding of collusive and merger-related phenomena.</span>

                    <span>This paper analyzes the impact of exchange rate risk on global food supply chains. Although the theoretical literature suggests ambivalence regarding the sign and magnitude of this effect, most empirical studies indicate a negative association between exchange rate volatility and international trade flows. I contribute to the ongoing debate by investigating the relationship at the product-level using a sectoral gravity model and relying on detailed retrospective trade and exchange rate data for a balanced panel of 159 countries for 2001 to 2017. I study the relationship for 781 agricultural and food products and estimate the trade effects of short-run and long-run exchange rate volatility. My findings indicate significant heterogeneity in the trade effects of exchange rate risk. While the mean trade effects are positive for short-run and long-run volatility, these effects vary substantially according to product and industry characteristics. I find a positive association between exchange rate volatility and the trade effects for upstreamness and a negative association for downstreamness of the traded products. I show that the significant and adverse trade effects in earlier studies result from model misspecification and measurement errors. This research enhances the understanding of the implications of exchange rate volatility which is a primary source of international risk exposure for global food supply chains.</span>

                    <span>People’s perceptions about others play an important role in shaping their own attitudes and behaviors, as well as social norms more broadly. This review presents a meta-analysis of the recent empirical literature that examines perceptions about others in the field. We document a number of stylized facts. Misperceptions about others are widespread, asymmetric, much larger when about out-group members, and positively associated with one’s own attitudes. Experimental treatments to re-calibrate misperceptions generally work as intended; they sometimes lead to meaningful changes in behaviors, though this often occurs only immediately after the treatments. We discuss different conceptual frameworks that could explain the origin, persistence, and rigidity of misperceptions about others. We point to several directions for future research.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in whether and how bureaucratic effectiveness contributes to development.  Just what makes for an effective bureaucracy and what are the building blocks of state capacity remain subject to debate.  This paper reviews the arguments connecting contemporary research using administrative data and field experiments to wider discussions of the origins of state capacity.  Most current research has been focused on understanding specific features of the environment in which bureaucrats operate. We connect this to discussions of bureaucratic systems, specifically the relationship to politics, citizens, firms and NGOs.</span>

                    <span>Inducing firms to make specialized investments through bilateral contracts can be challenging because of potential hold- up problems. Such contracting difficulties have long been argued to be an important reason for acquisitions. To evaluate the extent to which this motivation leads to mergers, we perform a textual analysis of the patents filed by the same lead inventors of the target firms before and after the mergers. We find that patents of inventors from target firms become 28.9% to 46.8% more specific to those of acquirers’ inventors following completed mergers, benchmarked against patents filed by targets and a group of counterfactual acquirers. This pattern is stronger for vertical mergers that are likely to require specialized investments. There is no change in the specificity of patents for mergers that are announced but not consummated. Overall, we provide empirical evidence that contracting issues in motivating specialized investment can be a motive for acquisitions.</span>

                    <span>It has been well recognized that population ageing could generate structural changes centered around the dwindling labor force, on one hand, and the expanding dependency on the generosity of the welfare state, on the other hand. Ageing-related welfare state policy entails both fiscal issues and migration issues. The paper employs a general-equilibrium model with a policy-making focus, to help understand the mechanism governing the provision of social benefits, labor income taxation, capital income taxation, migration curbs on low skilled and high skilled, driven by the ageing of the population. Greater generosity of the welfare state comes together with policy, incentive compatible with the interests of the majority voters, of a more liberal migration policy.</span>

We first articulate the key market failures in markets for innovation, and then discuss how both scientific norms and market-oriented policies help overcome those market failures.  We close by discussing recent work on the diffusion of inventions as well as on the links between innovation and inequality.</span>

                    <span>Card and Krueger (1992a,b) used labor market outcomes to study the productivity of school spending. Following their lead, we examine effects of post-1990 school finance reforms on students’ educational attainment and labor market outcomes. Lafortune et al. (2018) show that these reforms increased school spending and narrowed spending and achievement gaps between high- and low-income districts. Using a state-by-cohort panel design, we find that reforms increased high school completion and college-going, concentrated among Black students and women, and raised annual earnings. They also increased the return to education, particularly for Black students and men and driven by the return to high school.</span>

                    <span>A vast literature seeks to measure and explain the apparent decline in the labor share in national income that has occurred in recent times in the United States and elsewhere. The culprits include technological change, increased globalization and the rise of China, the enhanced exercise of market power by large firms in concentrated product markets, the decline in unionization rates and the erosion in the bargaining power of workers in labor markets, and the changing composition of the workforce due to a slowdown in population growth and a rise in educational attaintment. We review this literature, with special emphasis on the pitfalls associated with using cross-sectional data to assess this phenomenon and the reasons why the body of papers collectively explains the phenomenon many times over.</span>

                    <span>Linear panel models, and the &quot;event-study plots&quot; that often accompany them, are popular tools for learning about policy effects.  We discuss the construction of event-study plots and suggest ways to make them more informative. We examine the economic content of different possible identifying assumptions. We explore the performance of the corresponding estimators in simulations, highlighting that a given estimator can perform well or poorly depending on the economic environment. An accompanying Stata package, -xtevent-, facilitates adoption of our suggestions.</span>

                    <span>Recent research suggests that World Bank aid disbursements are associated with outflows from recipient countries to offshore financial centres, indicating elite capture of aid. This column uses 25 years of data to examine whether the same is true for IMF lending. It finds no evidence that IMF loans are diverted to offshore bank accounts. This could be because IMF lending differs in structural respects – such as conditionality, concessionality, and continuity – from World Bank aid.</span>

                    <span>Note: This is as of August 15th.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Slightly Decreases to 3.25%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 1 basis point from 3.26% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 3.25% as of August 15, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.6 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 1.66%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 3.92%, while the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) increased 10 basis points to 7.15%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers increased 2 basis points to 3.48%,  and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased 1 basis point to 3.35%.
“The share of loans in forbearance was little changed, as both new requests and exits were at a slower  pace compared to the prior week. In fact, exits were at their slowest pace in over a year,” said Mike  Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “There were more new forbearance  requests and re-entries for portfolio and PLS loans, leading to a 10-basis-point increase in their share.  Portfolio and PLS loans now account for almost 50% of all depository servicer loans in forbearance and  almost 40% of IMB servicer loans in forbearance, which highlights the importance of this investor  category.”

                    <span>Earlier: NAR: Existing-Home Sales Increased to 5.99 million in July
Two key points:
1) Existing home sales are somewhat above pre-pandemic levels rate of around 5.5 million SAAR (average six months prior to pandemic).  Seasonally adjusted (SA) sales for July 2021 were also the highest since 2006 - about 2% above July 2020. 

Some of the increase in sales over the previous year was probably related to  record low mortgage rates, strong second home buying, a strong stock market and favorable demographics.


Also, the delay in the 2020 buying season pushed the seasonally adjusted number to very high levels over the winter.   This means there are going to be some difficult comparisons in the second half of 2021!

2) Inventory is very low, and was down 12.0% year-over-year (YoY) in July.  Also,…</span>

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of August 20th, inventory was at 432 thousand (7 day average), compared to 594 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 27.3%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55%.


A week ago, inventory was at 422 thousand, and was down 29.8% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 40.8% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we&#x27;d normally expect, however inventory has increased (as a percentage) more than normal.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - back to the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.</span>

Figures varied from a year-over-year perspective as two regions saw gains, one witnessed a decline and one was unchanged.

                    <span>Carbon pricing is generally considered by economists as a superior alternative for emissions mitigation to command-and control regulation. This column uses data from the Italian electricity market to challenge this view in the context of the electricity sector, showing that carbon pricing schemes may not work efficiently when the major firms in the market are government controlled. As the vast majority of large electricity generators in the world are government-controlled and the electricity sector accounts for more than 40% of global carbon emissions from fuel combustion, the findings have important policy implications. Properly implemented command and control approaches might be more efficient, especially since reliable estimates of the production functions of electric generators are readily available.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic increased the pace of change in clients’ relationships with the banking sector, with mobility restrictions forcing banks to make better use of information technology to accommodate the increasing demand for digital financial services. This column analyses the role of IT adoption in bank lending since the outbreak of the pandemic. It finds that intermediaries with a higher degree of digital readiness provided more credit to non-financial corporations. It also shows that proximity to a physical bank branch increased the positive impact of IT on the amount of credit granted.</span>

Monday:
• At 8:30 AM ET, Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July.  This is a composite index of other data.
• At 10:00 AM, Existing Home Sales for July from the National Association of Realtors (NAR).  The consensus is for 5.81 million SAAR, down slightly from 5.86 million last month.
From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 are up 4 and DOW futures are up 30 (fair value).
Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $62.38 per barrel and Brent at $65.49 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $42, and Brent was at $44 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 50% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic). 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.14 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.18 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $0.96 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>The is only the second local market that I track that saw a year-over-year increase in active inventory in July.
Note: I&#x27;m tracking data for many local markets around the U.S. I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.
Here is a summary post for many markets: Existing Home Inventory in July: Local Markets

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Rates Stuck in The Middle
Rates are on hold until the next chapter is written in the complex saga of covid versus the market. This isn&#x27;t to say rates perfectly flat--simply that the prevailing momentum has been sideways for the past few weeks.
Since mortgage rates only change once or twice a day, we can use 10yr Treasury yields to see finer detail.  This entire week took place in the fairly narrow range of 1.29 to 1.21, and it ended with yields precisely in the middle at 1.25%.
...
What does all this mean in plain English?  Rates are low--much lower than most anyone expected at this point in the year.  The key reason is &quot;delta&quot; and Fed&#x27;s patient approach to changing rate-friendly policies.  The lingering concerns about the nature of the post-covid economy also make the list. [30 year fixed 2.93%]
