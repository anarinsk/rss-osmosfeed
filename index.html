                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Slightly Lower Despite Bond Market Weakness
Mortgage rates are directly based on trading levels in the bond market, so it&#x27;s almost a given that rates will move in the same direction as bond yields on any given day.  But for a variety of reasons, it doesn&#x27;t happen like that every day.  Today was just such a day. 
...
Keep in mind that we&#x27;re talking about extremely small movement.  Between Friday and today, you&#x27;d likely see the exact same &quot;note rate&quot; for any given conventional 30yr fixed scenario.  The improvements would only be detectable in the form of upfront costs.  [30 year fixed 3.07%]

                    <span>We study how salary history disclosures affect employer demand by using a novel, two-sided field experiment featuring hundreds of recruiters reviewing over 2000 job applications. We randomize the presence of salary history questions as well as candidates&#x27; disclosures. We find that employers make negative inferences about non-disclosing candidates, and view salary history as a stronger signal about competing options than worker quality. Disclosures by men (and other highly-paid candidates) yield higher salary offers, however they are negative signals of value (net of salary), and thus yield fewer callbacks. Male wage premiums are regarded as a weaker signal of quality than other sources (such as the premiums from working at higher paying firms, or being well-paid compared to peers). Recruiters correctly anticipate that women are less likely to disclose salary history at any level, and punish women less than men for silence. In our simulation of bans, we find no evidence that bans affect the gender ratio of callback choices, but find large reductions in gender inequality in salary offers among candidates called back. However, salary offers are lower overall (especially for men). A theoretical framework shows how these effects may differ by key properties of labor markets.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the causal effect of technology and knowledge transfers on early industrial development. Between 1950 and 1957, the Soviet Union supported the “156 Projects” in China for the construction of technologically advanced, large-scale, capital-intensive industrial facilities. We exploit idiosyncratic delays in project completion and the unexpected end of the Sino-Soviet Alliance, due to which some projects received Soviet technology embedded in capital goods and know-how, while others were eventually realized by China alone using domestic technology. We find that receiving both Soviet technology and know-how had large, persistent effects on plant performance, while the effects of receiving only Soviet capital goods were short-lived. The intervention generated horizontal and vertical spillovers, as well as production reallocation from state-owned to privately owned companies since the late 1990s.</span>

                    <span>One of the most important puzzles in microfinance is the low rate of borrower graduation to larger, more flexible loans. Utilizing observational and experimental data from a large Chilean microfinance institution, we demonstrate that loan officers impede borrower graduation due to common features of their compensation contracts. Our partner lender offers both microloans and larger, more flexible graduation loans, and relies on loan officer endorsements to determine borrower graduation. Loan officers are rewarded for the size of their portfolio and repayment, and so are implicitly penalized when good borrowers graduate. In an experiment designed to isolate strategic disclosure, we modify compensation to reduce this implicit penalty and document that loan officers withheld endorsements of their most qualified borrowers prior to the shift. Graduated borrowers endorsed after the shift are 34% more profitable for our partner lender than those endorsed beforehand. A back-of-the- envelope calculation suggests that strategic behavior of loan officers accounts for $4.8-29.2 billion in lost social value from forgone borrower graduations in microfinance worldwide. Our experimental design may prove useful for other experiments within firms.</span>

                    <span>Investing according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria is gaining momentum. Most environmental performance indices focus only on the tonnage of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. This paper proposes an index covering eight pollutants expressed in monetary damage. Inclusion of multiple pollutants reflects a broader range of reputational and regulatory risks. Monetization appropriately weights emissions. CO₂ dominates the mass of other pollutants, yet the marginal damages from other pollutants are larger than CO₂. In the U.S. utility sector from 2014 to 2017, indices which only track CO₂ mischaracterize firms’ environmental performance and underestimate its effect on financial outcomes relative to the multipollutant index. Dirtier firms exhibit lower share prices and higher forward returns. The effect is twice as large for the multipollutant index compared to CO₂. Analysts’ earnings forecasts for dirtier firms systematically undershoot actuals. Earnings errors are between three and five times more sensitive to the multipollutant index than to CO₂. The multipollutant index may suggest new management strategies to financial market participants relative to those based on carbon intensity. ESG disclosure standards based on the new index are more likely to affect financial outcomes, capital allocation decisions, and firm behavior than disclosure of carbon intensity.</span>

                    <span>We develop a theory of exchange rate fluctuations arising from financial institutions’ demand for dollar liquid assets. Financial flows are unpredictable and may leave banks “scrambling for dollars.” Because of settlement frictions in interbank markets, a precautionary demand for dollar reserves emerges and gives rise to an endogenous convenience yield on the dollar. We show that an increase in the dollar funding risk leads to a rise in the convenience yield and an appreciation of the dollar, as banks scramble for dollars. We present empirical evidence on the relationship between exchange rate fluctuations for the G10 currencies and the quantity of dollar liquidity, which is consistent with the theory.</span>

                    <span>We assess whether and why trade competition partly explains the sharp decline in U.S. workers’ attempts to organize labor unions in recent decades. We find that between 1990-2007, import competition due to the “China Shock” lowered union certification elections by 4.5% among workers in manufacturing industries directly exposed to it, and by 8.8% among workers indirectly exposed through its effect on their local labor market. Consistent with a simple model of workers’ decision to seek union representa- tion, we show that direct exposure lowered the expected wage gain from unionization, whereas indirect exposure increased the cost of job loss, both of which discourage worker organizing.</span>

                    <span>We study how two groups, those inside vs those outside echo chambers, react to a political event when we vary social media status (Twitter). Our treatments mimic two strategies often suggested as a way to limit polarization on social media: they expose people to counter-attitudinal data, and they get people to switch off social media. Our main result is that subjects that started inside echo chambers became more polarized when these two strategies were implemented. The only scenario where they did not become more polarized is when they did not even experience the political event. Interestingly, subjects that were outside echo chambers before our study began experienced no change (or a reduction) in polarization. We also study a group of non-Twitter users in order to have a simple, offline benchmark of the debate’s impact on polarization.</span>

                    <span>In principle, firms in developing countries benefit from the fact that advanced technologies and products have already been developed in industrialized countries and can simply be adopted, a process often referred to as industrial upgrading. But for many firms this advantage remains elusive. What is getting in the way? This paper reviews recent firm-level empirical research on the determinants of upgrading in developing countries. The first part focuses on how to define and measure various dimensions of upgrading --- learning, quality upgrading, technology adoption, and product innovation. The second part takes stock of recent micro-empirical evidence on the drivers of upgrading, classifying them as output-side drivers, input-side drivers, or drivers of know-how. The review concludes with some thoughts about promising directions for research in the area.</span>

                    <span>Classic theories suggest that common pool resources are subject to overexploitation. Community-based resource management approaches may ameliorate “tragedy of the commons” effects. Using a randomized evaluation in Namibia’s communal rangelands, we find that a comprehensive four-year program to support community-based rangeland and cattle management led to persistent and large improvements for eight of thirteen indices of social and behavioral outcomes. Effects on rangeland health, cattle productivity and household economics, however, were either negative or nil. Positive impacts on community resource management may have been offset by communities’ inability to control grazing by non-participating herds and inhibited by an unresponsive rangeland sub-system. This juxtaposition, in which measurable improvements in community resource management did not translate into better outcomes for households or rangeland health, demonstrates the fragility of the causal pathway from program implementation to intended socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. It also points to challenges for improving climate change–adaptation strategies.</span>

                    <span>Can frontier innovation be sustained under autocracy? We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat’s power; and (ii) the autocrat’s demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats’ suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime’s investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.</span>

For preference dimensions that are systematically biased toward the same gender across the globe, differences between men and women are larger in more gender-equal countries. In contrast, for preference dimensions with a gender bias that varies across countries, the opposite holds. This finding takes an important step toward reconciling evolutionary psychology and social role theory as they relate to gender.</span>

                    <span>We document substantial variation in the effects of a highly-effective literacy pro-gram in northern Uganda. The program increases test scores by 1.40 SDs on average, but standard statistical bounds show that the impact standard deviation exceeds 1.0SD. This implies that the variation in effects across our students is wider than the spread of mean effects across all randomized evaluations of developing country education interventions in the literature. This very effective program does indeed leave some students behind. At the same time, we do not learn much from our analyses that attempt to determine which students benefit more or less from the program. We reject rank preservation, and the weaker assumption of stochastic increasingness leaves wide bounds on quantile-specific average treatment effects. Neither conventional nor machine-learning approaches to estimating systematic heterogeneity capture more than a small fraction of the variation in impacts given our available candidate moderators.</span>

                    <span>Using a large survey panel that connects household shopping behavior with individual health information, this paper documents correlations between self reported depression and the size and composition of shopping baskets. First, we find that roughly 16% of individuals report suffering from depression and over 30% of households have at least one member who reports suffering from depression. Households with a member suffering from depression exhibit striking differences in shopping behavior: they spend less overall, visit grocery stores less and convenience stores more frequently and spend a smaller share of their baskets on fresh produce and alcohol but a larger share on tobacco. They spend similar shares on unhealthy foods like cakes, candy, and salty snacks. These cross-sectional correlations hold within counties, suggesting that they are not driven by region specific demographics or preferences that are incidentally correlated with depression status. They also hold when considering only single-member households. However, we rule out large differences in shopping behavior within households as they change depression status. Further, using the take-up of antidepressants as an event, we document little change in shopping in response to treatment. With our results, we discuss takeaways for the economic impact of depression and for decision modeling.</span>

We elicit (b), (c), and (d) with a daily online survey in the US from March to August 2020 (N ≈ 13,900).
We have three main findings: (1) beliefs elicited as infection case counts are closely related to present and future official case-count information; however (2) beliefs elicited as risk perceptions—i.e., the chance to get infected—are inconsistent with those case-count beliefs, even when mathematically, they should be identical; notably, (3) it is the latter—the risk perceptions—that are significantly better predictors of reported behavior than the former.
Together, these findings suggest that researchers and policymakers, who increasingly engage in direct elicitation and communication of numeric measures of uncertainty, may get very different outcomes, depending on which measures they use. We discuss potential implications for public communication of health-risk information.</span>

                    <span>This paper analyzes a simple model of infectious disease where the incentives for individuals to reduce risks through endogenous social distancing take straightforward cost-benefit form. Since disease is transmitted through social interactions, the threat of spread of infection poses a collective action problem. Policy interventions such as lockdowns, testing, and mask-wearing serve, in part, as substitutes for social distancing. Provision of a vaccination is the only intervention that unambiguously reduces both the peak infection level and the herd immunity level of infection. Adoption of vaccination remains limited in a decentralized equilibrium, with resulting reproductive rate of disease Rt &gt; 1 at the conclusion of vaccination. Vaccine mandates yield increases in vaccination rates and corresponding reductions in future infection rates but do not increase expected payoffs to individuals.</span>

                    <span>I study a model of the financial sector in which intermediation among debt financed banks gives rise to an endogenous core-periphery network – few highly interconnected and many sparsely connected banks. Endogenous intermediation generates excessive systemic risk in the financial network. Financial institutions have incentives to capture intermediation spreads through strategic borrowing and lending decisions. By doing so, they tilt the division of surplus along an intermediation chain in their favor, while at the same time reducing aggregate surplus. The network is inefficient relative to a constrained efficient benchmark since banks who make risky investments “overconnect”, exposing themselves to excessive counterparty risk, while banks who mainly provide funding end up with too few connections.</span>

                    <span>U.S. invention has become increasingly concentrated around major tech centers since the 1970s, with implications for how much cities across the country share in concomitant local benefits. Is invention becoming a winner-takes-all race? We explore the rising spatial concentration of patents and identify an underlying stability in their distribution. Software patents have exploded to account for about half of patents today, and these patents are highly concentrated in tech centers. Tech centers also account for a growing share of non-software patents, but the reallocation, by contrast, is entirely from the five largest population centers in 1980. Non-software patenting is stable for most cities, with anchor tenants like universities playing important roles, suggesting the growing concentration of invention may be nearing its end. Immigrant inventors and new businesses aided in the spatial transformation.</span>

                    <span>Different share classes on the same firms provide a natural experiment to explore how investor clienteles affect momentum and short-term reversals. Domestic retail investors have a greater presence in Chinese A shares, and foreign institutions are relatively more prevalent in B shares. These differences result from currency conversion restrictions and mandated investment quotas. We find that only B shares exhibit momentum and earnings drift, and only A shares exhibit monthly reversals. Institutional ownership strengthens momentum in B shares. These patterns accord with a setting where momentum is caused by informed investors who underreact to fundamental signals, and short-term reversals represent premia to absorb the demands of noise traders. Overall, our findings confirm that clienteles matter in generating stock return predictability from past returns.</span>

                    <span>There is an ongoing merger wave in the US hospital industry, but it remains an open question how hospital mergers change, or fail to change, hospital behavior, performance, and outcomes. In this research, we open the “black box” of practices within hospitals in the context of a mega-merger between two large for-profit chains. Benchmarking the effects of the merger against the acquirer’s stated aims, we show that they achieved some of their goals: they harmonized their electronic medical records and sent managers to target hospitals; after the acquisition, managerial processes were similar across hospitals in the merged chain. However, these interventions failed to drive detectable gains in profitability or patient outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the importance of hospital organizations and internal processes for merger research and policy in health care and the economy more generally.</span>

                    <span>We estimate the effect of local access to office-based mental healthcare on juvenile arrest outcomes. We leverage variation in the number of mental healthcare offices within a county over the period 1999 to 2016 in a two-way fixed-effects model. Office-based treatment is the most common modality of mental healthcare received by juveniles. We find that ten additional office-based mental healthcare providers in a county leads a decrease of 2.3% to 2.6% in the per capita costs to society of juvenile arrest. Findings are similar for arrest rates although often less precise, which suggests that accounting for social costs is empirically important. Crime imposes substantial costs on society and individuals, and interventions during early life can have more pronounced effects than those received at later stages, therefore our results imply increased juvenile access to mental healthcare may have an unintended benefit for the current and future generations.</span>

                    <span>The extensive literature on intergenerational mobility highlights the importance of family linkages but fails to provide credible evidence about the underlying family factors that drive the pervasive correlations.  We employ a unique combination of Dutch survey and registry data that links math and language skills across generations. We identify a causal connection between cognitive skills of parents and their children by exploiting within-family between-subject variation in these skills. The data also permit novel IV estimation that isolates variation in parental cognitive skills due to school and peer quality. The between-subject and IV estimates of the key intergenerational persistence parameter are strikingly similar and close at about 0.1. Finally, we show the strong influence of family skill transmission on children’s choices of STEM fields.</span>

                    <span>In a model with cheap talk, employers can send messages about their willingness to pay for higher ability workers, which job-seekers can use to direct their search and tailor their wage bid. Introducing such messages leads—under certain conditions—to an informative separating equilibrium which affects the number of applications, types of applications, and wage bids across firms. This model is used to interpret an experiment conducted in a large online labor market: employers were given the opportunity to state their relative willingness to pay for more experienced workers, and workers can easily condition their search on this information. Preferences were collected for all employers, but only treated employers had their signal revealed to job-seekers. In response to revelation of the cheap talk signal, job-seekers targeted their applications to employers of the right “type” and they tailored their wage bids, affecting who was matched to whom and at what wage. The treatment increased measures of match quality through better sorting, illustrating the power of cheap talk to improve market outcomes.</span>

Using proprietary data from a leading Chinese FinTech company, we study Fintech&#x27;s role in ending financial repression in China through the introduction of a money market fund with deposit-like features available through an already widely-adopted household payment platform.  Cities and banks whose depositor base is more exposed to FinTech see greater deposit outflows. Importantly, exposed banks respond to FinTech competition by offering competing products with market interest rates. FinTech thus facilitates a bottom-up interest rate liberalization.</span>

                    <span>Do basketball players exhibit a hot hand? Results from controlled shooting situations suggest the answer is yes, while results from in-game shooting are mixed. Are the differing results because a hot hand is only present in similar shots or because testing for the hot hand in game situations is difficult? Combining repeated shots in a location and shots across locations, the NBA 3-Point Contests mimics game situations without many of the confounding factors. Using data on the 1986-2019 contests, we find a hot hand, but only within shot locations. Shooting streaks increase a hot hand only if a player makes his previous shot and only within locations. Even making three shots in a row has no effect on making the next shot if a player moves locations. Our results suggest that any hot hand in basketball is only present in extremely similar shooting situations and likely not in the run-of-play.</span>

                    <span>Each year, around 500,000 children under 5 die from diarrhea, making it the third-leading cause of death in this age group. More than 80 percent of these deaths are attributable to unsafe drinking water. Drinking water can be made safe through dilute chlorine solution, but take-up of this technology has been low. Previous work has shown that free community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution through “dispensers” – reservoirs of chlorine solution at water sources that make chlorination easy and free – increases take-up of chlorination. However, it has remained unclear whether this increase also translates into reduced mortality. Here we show that four years of community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution in rural Kenya reduces all-cause under-5 mortality by 1.4 percentage points (95% CI: 0.3 pp, 2.5 pp), a 63% reduction relative to control. We estimate that at USD 25 per DALY averted, free provision of chlorine solution is twenty times more cost-effective than the WHO “highly cost-effective” threshold.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the effect of hiring skilled immigrant employees on the performance of organizations. This relationship has been difficult to establish in prior work due to theoretical ambiguity, limited data, and inherent endogeneity. We overcome these difficulties by studying European football (soccer) clubs during 1990-2020. Detailed microdata from this setting offers unusual transparency on the migration and hiring of talent and their contribution to collective performance. Further, the industry is characterized by country-level rule changes that govern the number of immigrant players clubs can hire. Using these rule changes as the basis for instrumental variables, we find a positive local average treatment effect of the number of immigrant players on the club’s in-game performance. To examine the theoretical mechanisms, we explore whether immigrants cause superior performance because they are more talented than natives or because they enhance the national diversity of their clubs. We find strong evidence for the talent mechanism. We find contingent evidence for the national diversity mechanism: national diversity has a positive relationship with club performance only when the club employs an immigrant manager (coach). The presence of an immigrant manager also strengthens the positive relationship between the number of immigrant players and club performance.</span>

However, today’s policymakers face the same challenge as those in the past: identifying conditions – such as dynamic productivity effects or externalities – under which activist industrial policy is welfare-improving.</span>

🚩 Increasing 7 day average week-over-week for Cases, Hospitalized, and Deaths     
✅ Goal met.
  

IMPORTANT: For &quot;herd immunity&quot; most experts believe we need 70% to 85% of the total population fully vaccinated (or already had COVID).  Note: COVID will probably stay endemic (at least for some time).


KUDOS to the residents of the 5 states that have achieved 70% of total population fully vaccinated: Vermont at 71.7%, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts at 70.0% .


KUDOS also to the residents of the 16 states and D.C. that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: New York at 67.2%, , New Jersey, Maryland, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, Virginia, District of Columbia,  Colorado, California, Pennsylvania,  Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Hawaii, and Florida at 60.1%.

The following 20 states have between 50% and 59.9% fully vaccinated: Wisconsin at 58.7%, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky, South Dakota, Texas, Arizona, Kansas, Nevada, Alaska, Utah, North Carolina, Ohio, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Indiana, and Missouri at 50.1%.

Next up (total population, fully vaccinated according to CDC) are Georgia at 48.6%, Arkansas at 48.4%, Louisiana at 48.0%, and Tennessee at 48.0%.

                    <span>Note: This is as of October 31st.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Decreases to 2.06%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance  decreased by 9 basis points from 2.15% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 2.06% as of  October 31, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 5 basis points to 0.92%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 13 basis points to 2.52%, and the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) declined 13 basis points to 5.00%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers decreased 15 basis points relative  to the prior week to 2.28%, and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased 5 basis points to 2.02%.
  
“One million homeowners remained in forbearance as we reached the end of October, but the  forbearance share continued to decline, with larger declines for portfolio and PLS loans,” said Mike  Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “More borrowers who exited forbearance  the last week of October went into modifications, a sign that they have not yet regained their pre-pandemic level of income.”
Added Fratantoni, “The strong job market report from October, with another drop in the unemployment  rate and a pickup in wage growth, is a positive sign for homeowners still struggling to get back on their  feet.”

Excerpt (much more in newsletter):
Some homebuilder comments courtesy of Rick Palacios Jr., Director of Research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting (a must follow for housing on twitter!):
...
#Dallas builder: “Due to a large number of sales in 2021, we’ll have declines in 2022. This is due to land availability. Huge number of communities coming online in 2023. Supply chain issues are getting worse &amp; have spread to land development.”.
#Seattle builder: “Sales &amp; closings in 2022 will be negatively impacted by limited supply of lots being delivered to the market in early 2022 with recovery in late 2022. No demand impacts are forecasted to impact sales or closings in 2022.”
#Atlanta builder: “We pulled so many extra sales &amp; starts into 2021 that we&#x27;re going to be severely short on vacant developed lots in the first half of 2022, hence the huge projected slowdowns in sales &amp; starts in 2022.”

                    <span>From the Federal Reserve: The October 2021 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The October 2021 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the standards and terms on, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months, which generally correspond to the third quarter of 2021.
Regarding loans to businesses, respondents to the October survey, on balance, reported easier standards and stronger demand for commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans to large and middle-market firms over the third quarter. Banks also reported easier standards for C&amp;I loans to small firms, while demand from small firms remained basically unchanged.2 For commercial real estate (CRE), banks reported easier standards for all loan categories. Banks also reported stronger demand for multifamily loans and for loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties, while demand for construction and land development loans remained basically unchanged. For loans to households, banks eased standards across most categories of residential real estate (RRE) loans, on net, and reported weaker demand for most types of RRE loans over the third quarter. Banks also eased standards across all three consumer loan categories—credit card loans, auto loans, and other consumer loans—while reports on demand for consumer loans were mixed.

This shows that banks have eased standards (tightened for subprime), and that there is decreased demand for RRE loans.</span>

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of November 5th, inventory was at 401 thousand (7 day average), compared to 530 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 24.3%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55.3% from 898 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 414 thousand, and was down 23.9% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 31% above the record low in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September.   Nine weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 8.2% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for October.</span>

Bowman comments on house prices and the end of the forbearance programs.  Here are here comments on house prices: 
Home prices had been rising at a moderate rate since 2012, but since mid-2020, their growth has accelerated significantly. In total, home prices in September were 21 percent higher than in June 2020. Home price increases are also widespread. In September, about 90 percent of American cities had experienced rising home prices over the past three months, and the home price increases were substantial in most of these cities.
These sharp increases raise the concern that housing is overvalued and that home pri…</span>

Over the last years, an enormous interest in this question has created a large body of research, mostly focused around evidence from field experiments and micro-level administrative data. This column reviews this recent literature and embeds it in the broader discussion on how bureaucracies contribute to economic development. The authors argue that this recent evidence matters, but also encourage future research to study bureaucracies as systems, and to analyse their systemic relations to politics, citizens, firms, and NGOs.</span>

                    <span>Growing spatial inequality has led policymakers to offer firms tax breaks to attract investment and jobs to economically peripheral regions. This column examines a place-based bonus depreciation scheme in Japan which granted high-tech manufacturers immediate cost deductions from their corporate income tax bill. The policy generated big gains in employment and investment in building construction and in machines at pre-existing production sites. This response was driven by firms which rely on costly but long-lived capital inputs like industrial machines. How firms react to spatially targeted tax incentives ultimately depends on their internal network and their composition of intermediate capital inputs.</span>

From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 and DOW futures are mostly unchanged (fair value).
Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $81.27	per barrel and Brent at $82.74 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $37, and Brent was at $38 - so WTI oil prices are up more than double year-over-year.

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: A Zillow Flip that Flopped
Excerpt: 
Here is an example flop from Zillow.
This home is at 271 Capella Ave in La Habra California. It is list by Active Realty (that seems to be associated with Zillow). This is a single story home in a decent area (California prices are always crazy compared to most of the US).
...
So my guess is Zillow lost north of $10,000 on this one flop.

UPDATE: I left out the fee Zillow charges when they purchase the house, so their loss as not as bad as I initially thought (although I left out some expenses too).</span>

                    <span>Economic integration has certainly deepened and, more recently, changed enormously. Until the late 1990s integration was mostly trade-centred, while it now can be better described as institutions-centred. This column introduces the notion of ‘institutional integration’, identifies its main features, and provides estimates of its net benefits. With one of the first applications of the synthetic difference-in-differences estimator and using data from the 1995 enlargement of the EU, the authors find that the failure to embrace institutional integration by Norway (compared to ‘only’ embracing deep integration) generates yearly productivity losses of about 0.6 percentage points.</span>

                    <span>Agricultural global value chains grew rapidly after WWII, transforming the nature of agri-food production worldwide. Still, little is known about how taking part in these chains changes the structure of an economy. This column constructs a panel dataset from 155 countries for the period from 1991 to 2015, examining the effect that participation had on each country’s structural transformation and uncovering evidence that runs counter to conventional wisdom: modern agrarian economies are leapfrogging the manufacturing sector to develop their agriculture and service sectors through participation in agricultural global value chains.</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of November 2nd.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: October Forbearance Exits Pick Up Pace in Final Week of Month
Improvement in the number of active COVID-19 forbearance plans continued this week as early entrants bumped against final expirations.
According to our McDash Flash daily mortgage performance dataset, the number of loans in active forbearance fell 85,000 (-6.9%). The week’s strongest declines were seen in FHA/VA plans, which marked a 42,000 (-9%) plan reduction. Strong improvement was also observed among GSE plans, which declined by 22,000 (-6%), as well as  those held in bank portfolios or private label securities, (-21,000, -5.3%).
As of Nov. 2, 1.14 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 2.1% of all active mortgages, including 1.2% of GSE, 3.5% FHA/VA and 2.8% of portfolio/PLS loans.

  Active plans are now down 332,000 (-23%) from the same time last month, as the first wave of forbearance entrants continue to reach their final expirations. Further improvement is likely next week as well, given the 129,000 reviews still scheduled for October, 75% of which are expected to be final expirations.
Finally, forbearance plan starts decreased 8% this week, with plan restart activity falling to its lowest level since early October.

                    <span>From the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Rail Time Indicators.  Graphs and excerpts reprinted with permission. 
U.S. rail volumes continue to be impacted by supply chain issues and an economy that isn’t yet  what it could be.
Total U.S. carloads rose 3.8% in October 2021 over October 2020 as year-over-year gains in coal,  chemicals, and crushed stone and sand, among others, exceeded declines in motor vehicles, grain, and  petroleum products. October was the eighth straight month in which total carloads were higher than  the same month in 2020, but the 3.8% gain in October was the lowest gain in those eight months. ...
Supply chain problems (especially shortages of dray trucks, drivers, and warehouse space) kept  U.S. intermodal volume down in October — it fell 7.9% from October 2020, its third straight year-over-year decline.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
Total U.S. carload traffic has risen slightly but  perceptibly over the past two months. At the end of  October, the 6-week moving average for total carloads originated was 237,999. That’s the most since mid-June. ... Total carloads in  October 2021 were down 3.1% from October 2019. In  each month so far in 2021, total carloads in 2021 have  been below the comparable month in 2019.
The second graph shows the six week average (not monthly) of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
[I]ntermodal volumes continue to be driven down by supply chain problems — especially  shortages of dray trucks, drivers, and warehouse space — that are preventing rail customers from clearing their freight from rail terminals as quickly as they and railroads would like. Intermodal in October  2021 was down 7.9% from October 2020, its third straight year-over-year decline. October 202o was at  the time the best intermodal month ever.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: 1st Look at Local Housing Markets in October
Excerpt: 
This is the first look at local markets in October.  I’m tracking about 30 local housing markets in the US. Some of the 30 markets are states, and some are metropolitan areas. I’ll update these tables throughout the month as additional data is released.
My view is that if the housing market is slowing, it will show up in inventory (not yet!).
...
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these three markets were down 24% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is larger than in September. This isn’t indicating a slowing market (but this is just 3 early reporting markets).

                    <span>A few brief excerpts from a note by Goldman Sachs economist Spencer Hill:
We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 525k in October ... tomorrow’s report reflects the first full month of hiring following the expiration of federal enhanced unemployment benefits. Our forecast also reflects improving public health, strong labor demand, and a partial education rebound as schools gradually fill positions left open at the start of the school year. On the negative side, the seasonal factors may have evolved to fit the strong October 2020 data, raising the seasonal hurdle in tomorrow’s report. ... We estimate a one-tenth drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7%.

CR Note: The consensus is for 450 thousand jobs added, and for the unemployment rate to decrease to 4.7%.</span>

                    <span>Note: Since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic, CoStar is comparing to 2019.

From CoStar: STR: Tampa Leads Top 25 US Markets in Weekly Performance
As anticipated ahead of Halloween, U.S. hotel performance fell week over week, according to STR‘s latest data through 30 October.
Oct. 24-30, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 58.9% (-5.7%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$127.70 (+1.5%)
• evenue per available room (RevPAR): US$75.28 (-4.3%)
Even with a drop in performance levels from previous weeks, comparisons with the matching week in 2019 improved because Halloween that year fell on a Thursday and created a more significant disruption in business travel and groups.
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The occupancy rate will now decline seasonally into the new year.</span>

인간과 시공간이라는 물리적 한계를 넘어 그 속에서 상호 융합 및 공진화하게 될 메타버스 글로벌 시장! 지금까지 계속 관망만 해 왔다면, 이제는 마지막 기회가 될 메타버스에 과감히 탑승하길 바란다. 앞으로 AR·VR 등 XR 기반의 기업들과 AI, 블록체인 기업들이 힘을 합쳐 지속적으로 메타버스 기술 개발을 이끌어가야 할 것이다. 

메타버스 시장은 2020년 50조 원, 2023년 535조 원 이상, 2030년에는 1,700조 원가량 성장할 전망이며, 우리나라는 향후 5년간 2.6조 원의 메타버스 관련 예산을 단계적으로 집행할 예정이다. 그렇다면 그 주인공은 누가 될 것인가? 현재로서는 예측이 불가하지만 문화와 IT 기술, 콘텐츠 강국인 대한민국이 그 주인공이었으면 하는 바람이다. 그리고 그 변화의 바람에 나도 함께할 것이다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

어떻게 하면 이 시대 청년들에게 꿈과 희망을 줄 수 있을까? 이 시대적 과제에 대한 해결책을 모색하고자 뜻을 같이하는 교수 6명이 이 책을 집필하게 되었다. 더 이상 강단에서 지켜보지만 말고 시대에 역행하는 모순을 바로잡아야만 한다는 사명감에서 출발하였다. 

흔히 우리는 기술혁신이 일자리를 빼앗고 소득 양극화를 심화시킬 수 있다고 오해하기 쉽다. 그러나 이는 편견에 지나지 않으며, 불평등 사회를 조장하는 것은 기술혁신이 아니라 그 혁신을 가로막는 제도다. 그 제도 때문에 일자리가 줄어드는 것이다.

제1장 노동시장의 이중구조와 노동조합의 사회적 책임

낙후된 노동법

3. 노동조합의 사회적 책임은 우리나라만의 문제인가
노동조합의 사회적 책임
자본주의와 노동조합의 사회적 책임
정부와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：미국

손 놓고 있는 한국
노동개혁의 방향
일자리문제의 시각부터 바로잡자
중소기업을 고임금 일자리로 만들자

메타버스, OTT, 밈테크, 틱톡, 슈퍼 IP, 이커머스, 오리지널 콘텐츠…. 만약 이런 단어가 낯설다면 당신은 세상의 변화에 둔감한 사람일지 모른다. 1020세대의 전유물이라고 치부되던 뉴미디어와 그 매체가 담아내는 독창적인 콘텐츠는 이제 보편적이고 대중적인 문화로 자리 잡아가고 있다. 뿐만 아니라 유튜브와 숏폼의 인기 콘텐츠가 거시적인 사회문화 트렌드의 출발지가 되는 사례가 점차 늘어나면서, 뉴미디어 콘텐츠의 영향력이 커지고 있다.

국내에서 가장 많은 유튜브 빅데이터를 분석하는 MCN 샌드박스네트워크는 이 책에서 사회 변화의 맥락을 짚어내고, 앞으로 전개될 사회문화 트렌드의 변화를 거시적으로 예측한다. 그리고 이를 좀 더 깊이 있게 다루기 위해 10개의 트렌드 키워드 ‘부캐, 팬덤, 숏폼, 호모집쿠스, 밈테크, 메타버스, 오리지널 콘텐츠, e스포츠, 브랜디드 콘텐츠, 알고리즘’을 선정해 분석한다. 이 책을 통해 뉴미디어 산업의 최신 동향부터 시장 전망까지 파악하며, 새로운 비즈니스와 부의 기회를 발견할 수 있을 것이다.

시장이 클수록 혁신에 대한 보상은 증가하며, 이는 더 많은 혁신을 불러온다. 그러나 전 세계 인구의 0.7%에도 미치지 못하지만 세계 10위의 경제 규모를 가지게 된 우리나라는 무역을 통해서 혁신을 자극하는 효과를 누려왔다. 박지형 교수는 한국의 사례를 들어 국내의 인적·물적 자원뿐 아니라 전 세계 자원을 효과적으로 활용해야 지속적 혁신을 할 수 있다고 강조한다.

2021년 글로벌혁신지수(Global Innovation Index)에서 한국은 스위스, 스웨덴, 미국, 영국에 이어 세계 5위의 혁신국가로 평가됐다. 하지만 한국은 ‘기술 융합 역량’은 우수한 편이나 ‘창의적 사고’와 ‘공정하고 유연한 제도’의 면에서는 다른 선진국에 비해 뒤처진다. 이정민 교수는 정부가 충분한 숙려 기간과 사전 검토 기간을 거친 후 정책을 체계적으로 결정해야 엉뚱한 곳으로 투자 자원이 소모되지 않는다고 지적한다.

돈이 무엇인지 설명한다. 세계사의 여러 장면을 조명해 돈이 어떻게 만들어지고, 어떻게 발전해왔는지 알아본다. 지배자들은 돈에 개입해 주화라는 개념을 만들면서 시뇨리지를 챙기고, 지배자들의 더 큰 개입은 훗날 은행으로 발전한다. 

천재 과학자 뉴턴은 영국의 금본위제를 도입하고 이는 산업혁명과 함께 유럽 전체가 금본위제를 도입하게 되는 시발점이 된다. 사실 영국의 금본위제는 우연과 실수의 산물이며 이는 중국과 유럽 사이의 무역 불균형에서 초래한 바가 크다.

한편, 두 번의 세계 대전을 거쳐 미국의 달러는 소위 기축통화의 위치를 얻게 되는데 소위 브레튼 우즈 협약을 통해 미국 달러는 종이로 만든 금의 위치에 오르게 된다. 훗날 IMF는 SDR이라는 형태로 케인스가 주창했던 방코르를 흉내 내고 이는 현재까지도 세계 무역의 기본이 되는 통화다. 

이 밖에도 미국과 일본의 양적완화와 테이퍼링, 인플레이션과 초인플레이션, 현대 통화 이론 등을 살펴보며 미국 정책금리와 통화량의 변화도 알아본다. 전 세계를 뜨겁게 달군 비트코인도 조명한다. 비트코인은 화폐인지, 비트코인은 투자인지 투기인지, FATF와 가상자산은 무엇인지, 암호화폐와 토큰, NFT, DeFi, CBDC, DAO 비트코인과 엘살바도르의 위험한 실험, 디지털 자산의 실체도 자세히 살펴본다.

경제라는 복잡한 세계의 입구에서 갈팡질팡하는 분들을 위해 쓰인 책이다. 비즈니스는 물론이고 정치와 행정 등 모든 사회적 현상의 기초에는 경제 문제가 관련되어 있다. 하지만 일반적인 경제학 입문서나 교과서에는 추상적인 개념만 가득할 뿐, 우리의 실생활과 어떤 관련이 있는지는 찾아보기 어렵다. 

이 책은 ‘가격’이라는, 경제에서 가장 기초가 되는 키워드를 바탕으로 쓰인 책이다. 가격이 상품과 함께 태어나서 자라나는 험난한 여정을 따라가며, 가격이 수행하는 사회적 역할의 크기를 살펴보고 어떤 사람들이 어떻게 가격을 만들고 키워내는지, 그 과정을 거슬러 올라가며 확인할 것이다. 또 사회 속에 존재하는, 가격을 중심으로 한 전반적인 경제 시스템을 탐구해 나갈 것이다.

가격은 ‘우리의 생활’ 그 자체다. 이 책의 의도는 가격 결정 과정에서부터 시작된 경제가 사회에서 실제로 어떻게 작용하는지, 그 생생한 시스템을 보여 주는 것이다. 약속하건대 이 책을 읽는 사람은 누구든 경제가 무엇인지 명확하게 실감할 수 있게 될 것이다.

들어가며 - 옛날에는 주먹밥에 가격이 없었다?
프롤로그 - 가격을 통해 보는 사회 시스템

제1장 우리는 가격에 의지해 구매할 수밖에 없는가?
물건을 산다는 것은 무엇일까? 
사실 구매자는 상품에 대해 잘 모른다 
왜 내가 올 것이라는 것을 미리 알고 있을까? 
우리의 눈은 ‘이안 반사식 카메라’ 
가격은 경제의 ‘키 플레이어’

제2장 경제의 이모저모는 가격이 조정한다
전제: 시장경제란 무엇일까 
매매에서는 ‘가격’과 ‘수량’이 문제 
‘가격 메커니즘’ - 가격이 움직이면 수량도 움직인다 
경매에서는 ‘가격 메커니즘’이 작동한다 
가격 메커니즘은 그래프로 나타낼 수 있다 

제3장 투입한 생산비용을 회수할 수 있을까?
상품을 생산한다는 것은 무엇일까? 
상품이 팔리지 않는 것이 가장 큰 문제 
이익을 키우는 방법 
리스크가 적은 행동을 선택한다 
드디어 출하! 
가격은 생산자의 생명줄

제4장 가격은 어떻게 결정되는가?
현실의 시장은 어떤 시스템인가? 
시장에는 상품도 기업도 모여든다 
도매상을 중심으로 사고팔다 
경매 거래로 공정한 가격을 만든다 
시장이라는 시스템을 
경제학적으로 생각해 보자 
경매의 구조 
수요와 공급은 어떻게 가격을 결정할까

제5장 전부 팔아 치우기 위한 전략적 가격 결정
소매상에 있어 가격이란 무엇일까? 
상점에서는 가격을 어떻게 결정할까? 
소비자는 어떻게 판단할까? 
소비자의 ‘실속있는 소비’, 그 적정 가격은? 
타점포와의 가격 경쟁도 있다 
‘가격을 파는’ 전략을 취한다 
이렇게 해서 가격이 결정된다

제6장 최후의 관문, 소비자의 ‘까다로운 눈’
적절한 가격을 순간적으로 판단하는 기준은? 
쇼핑의 심리와 행동의 흐름 
우리는 매번 합리적으로 판단하지는 않는다 
판매자가 교묘히 이용하는 쇼핑 심리 
우리도 경험을 쌓아 직감을 기르자

덧붙이는 장 눈에 보이지 않는 가격도 있다
칼럼① 무료여도 괜찮을까? 
칼럼② 보이지 않는 가격에는 어떤 의미가 있을까? 
칼럼③ 가격의 끝자리를 주목하자 
칼럼④ ...

사람들은 비어 있는 집(공간)을 공유하거나 주차장에 세워져 있는 차로 운송 및 배송을 하며 부수입을 얻을 수 있다. 나만이 알고 있던 지식이나 창작물을 콘텐츠화해 확산시키며 구독자를 늘릴 수 있다. 카카오톡으로 메시지를 공유하거나 네이버와 구글에서 지식 검색을 하고 답변을 올리면서 데이터 생산에 참여한다. 이 데이터들은 빅테크 기업의 자산이 된다.

이처럼 플랫폼은 우리의 일상을 조금씩 바꾸고 있다. 새로 등장한 경제 방식을 제대로 활용하기 위해서는 플랫폼에 대한 정의부터 예시까지 정확한 이해가 필수다. ‘10대가 꼭 읽어야 할 사회・과학 교양 시리즈’의 열 번째 주제인 ‘플랫폼 경제’는, 동시대를 살아가는 우리 청소년들이 경험하게 될 경제사회를 이해하는 데 꼭 필요한 개념을 소개하며 미래를 준비하게 도와준다.

익숙하지 않을 뿐, 부족한 게 아니에요’라는 슬로건 아래, 이제 막 사회에 발을 들여 모든 것이 낯설고 두려운 뽀시래기 직장인들을 위한 뉴스레터를 만들고 있는  팀이 신입사원이나 IT 용어가 낯선 이들이 현장에서 바로 써먹을 수 있는 실무 용어들을 모아 한 권의 책으로 엮은 것이다. 

이 책에서는 총 175개의 용어를 7개의 분야로 나눠 설명하고 있는데, 우리의 뽀시래기 직장인들이 궁금해하는 용어가 실제 현장에서 어떻게 활용되는지 대화와 상황 설명을 통해 보여주고, 뽀식이 캐릭터를 활용한 일러스트와 더 알아두면 좋은 정보를 통해 해당 용어를 실무에서 완벽하게 이해 혹은 활용할 수 있도록 도와주고 있다.

대학에서 지난 수년간 “소프트웨어 프로그래밍(파이썬)” 과목을 강의하면서 다양한 교과서를 살펴보았다. 어떤 서적은 한 학기에 파이썬 교육을 완성하기에 분량이 너무 많았고 시간이 부족해서 적절한 교과서를 찾기 쉽지 않았다. 연세대 강의는 전교의 다양한 학생들이 수강하고 있으며 거의 대부분의 수강생들이 프로그래밍 배경이 전혀 없는 상태이다. 실제 강의는 매주 강의 2시간 및 실습(LAB) 2시간으로 진행해 왔다. 이러한 요구와 여건에 맞추어 이 책을 저술하게 되었다. 

이 책은 실제 강의 내용에 기반하여 LAB 내용(연습문제의 B. 따라하기 실습 및 C. 프로그래밍 실습)을 구성하였다. 수강생들은 LAB 내용(B. 따라하기 실습)을 그대로 따라함으로써 파이썬 언어를 익히고, 간단한 프로그래밍 문제(C. 프로그래밍 실습)를 LAB 시간 내에 완성하는 방식을 따랐다. 이 책을 사용하는 모든 사람이 이와 동일한 방법으로 비교적 단시간 내에 파이썬 언어의 모든 것을 배우고 활용 능력을 발휘해 나갈 수 있을 것이다.

1위 반도체 기업들의 경쟁력과 전략. 새로운 승자들의 도전 등 혁신과 전략의 과정을 기술 발전 사례와 데이터를 토대로 설명했던 《반도체 제국의 미래》에 최근의 혼란스러운 국내외 반도체 산업의 환경까지 모두 담아 2년 만에 개정증보판으로 새롭게 출간됐다.

기존의 알찬 구성에 진공관, 트랜지스터, 모스펫 등 진화를 거쳐 우리가 아는 반도체가 되기까지 흐름을 알 수 있도록 내용을 추가했고, 새 CEO를 영입하며 새로운 생태계 조성을 시도하는 인텔의 야심을 엿볼 수 있다. 기존 부록에서 반도체 공정에 관한 자세한 설명으로 독자의 이해를 도왔다면, 이번 개정증보판에는 향후 시장의 방향성까지 짐작할 수 있도록 했다. 

독자는 첫 번째, 팹리스 관점에서 파운드리 사업이 무엇인지 알아보고 급변하는 파운드리 시장에 관해 이해하며, 두 번째, 2021년 6월, 미국 백악관이 발표한 반도체 공급망 보고서 내용을 통해 한층 더 치열해진 각축전에서 기업이 어떤 노력을 기울일지 가늠할 수 있다.

반도체 산업의 발전과 변화 속도는 어떤 분야와도 비교할 수 없을 만큼 빠르다. 《반도체 제국의 미래》는 저자의 날카로운 시선으로 각 기업들이 구사한 전략의 구체적이고 생생한 사례, 데이터와 전문지 등을 기반으로 한 근거와 전망, 합리적인 미래 예측까지 선보였다. 이번 개정증보판…</span>

이미 강남 아파트 가격이 미국 맨해튼의 평당 가격을 넘어선 지 오래다. 자산은 버블 국면에 진입하면 그 자체의 관성으로 계속 오르는 경향이 있다. 언젠가 터질 것을 알지만 적어도 내 앞은 아닐 것이라는 낙관론, 정부가 무언가 할 것이라는 학습 효과가 지금과 같은 2030세대의 비이성적인 주택 추격 매수까지 양산하고 있다. 

그렇다면 한국의 가계부채는 얼마나 위험한가? 향후 경제에 부담을 줄 사안을 넘어 금융 시스템 위기, 나아가 전반적인 경제 위기로까지 확산될 것인가? 오랫동안 금융의 관점에서 부동산을 분석해온 저자가 부채 위기의 진단을 통해 경고와 조언, 정책 방안을 제시한다.

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.

영국의 경제사학자이자 『존 메이너드 케인스』 전기 3부작으로 세계적 명성을 얻은 원로 경제 석학 로버트 스키델스키 교수의 최신 화제작. 2008년 글로벌 금융 위기 예측 실패 이후 별다른 진보를 보이지 못한 ‘주류 경제학(신고전주의 경제학)’의 문제점을 총체적으로 진단하고 처방을 모색한다. 모두 13개 장을 할애해 ‘방법론적 결함’에서 ‘학문적 불완전성’까지 치밀하게 살핀다. 비판의 강도가 높고 범위도 넓다.

이 책에서 스키델스키 교수는 작심하고 주류 경제학을 공격하지만, 그 의도는 경제학을 향한 깊은 믿음과 기대에 있다. 그가 보기에 경제학이야말로 인류에게 ‘더 나은 삶’을 열어줄 수 있는 가장 강력하고 현실적인 학문이기 때문이다. 그는 경제학 본연의 역할을 되찾아주고자 이 책을 썼다.

세계 제일의 케인스 전문가라는 타이틀 탓에 ‘케인스주의’로의 회귀를 주장할 것 같지만 그렇지 않고, 주류 경제학을 공격한다고 해서 비주류 경제학을 옹호하는 것도 아니다. 저자는 ‘신고전주의’가 경제학의 주류가 된 배경을 명확히 인지하되, 그 속의 심각한 결함을 바로잡아야 ‘더 나은 삶을 위한 경제학’으로의 대전환을 이룰 수 있다고 역설한다.

서울대 비교경제연구센터와 경제추격연구소에서 매년 발행하는 《2022 한국경제 대전망》이 출간되었다. 서울대학교 경제학부 교수이자 국민경제자문회의 부의장인 이근 교수를 위시하여 총 26명의 경제전문가들이 분야별 산업별 국내외 이슈를 통해 우리나라 경제를 거시적으로 조망해보는 미래예측서이다.

올해 우리나라 경제는 여러 가지 중대한 진퇴양난 상황에 부딪쳤다. 대외적으로는 미국과 중국 사이에서 균형 있는 선택이 필요했다. 미·중 모두와 긴밀한 관계를 맺고 있는 한국은 미국에 섣불리 동조하기도, 여전히 성장하는 중국 시장을 무시하기도 어려웠다. 대내적으로는 코로나19 위기에 대응하기 위해 정부 재정 지출을 확충하면서 증가하는 국가부채를 고려해야 했다.

2022년 한국경제는 ‘합종연횡’이라는 키워드 아래 코로나19 경제위기에서의 탈출이라는 큰 흐름을 이어나갈 전망이다. 미·중의 통상 갈등 문제는 바이든 정부 출범 후 처음 열린 G7 정상회의에서 서방의 중국 견제가 공고화되면서 새 전기를 맞았다. 대중국 견제가 강화되면 미중 사이 디커플링이 심화되면서, 그동안 중국과의 강력한 경쟁 압력에 직면해왔던 한국 기업은 도약의 기회를 맞이할 수 있다.

2021년 노벨 경제학상은 ‘최저임금과 실업률’ 간의 기존 통념이 잘못됐음을 입증한 실증경제학자 데이비드 카드 교수에게 수여됐다. 돌아보면 1968년에 노벨 경제학상이 생겨난 후 수십 년 동안은 거의 수학 이론의 차지였다. 그러나 2008년을 기점으로 비수학적 모델에 경제학상을 수여하는 사례가 늘고 있다.

세상이 점점 더 복잡해지고 시장의 불확실성 또한 커지면서 기존의 경제학 이론으로는 설명할 수 없는 현상들이 등장하고 있기 때문이다. 하지만 여느 학문이 그러하듯이 행동경제학이나 진화경제학 등 새로운 경제학 이론 모델도 이전의 경제학자들이 만들어놓은 토대 위에서 발전해온 것이다.

이 책은 경제학의 300년 역사를 선택 이론을 중심으로 펼쳐내며 새로운 서사를 제안한다. 그 서사의 축은 위험과 불확실성 그리고 인간(더 정확히는 인간의 욕망)이다. 그에 따라 경제적 의사결정에 가장 기본적 척도인 효용(재화나 용역에 대한 주관적인 만족의 정도) 이론을 태동시킨 수학자들(니콜라스 베르누이, 다니엘 베르누이, 레몽 드 몽모르, 가브리엘 크라메르)과 존 로크, 제러미 벤담 등 사상가들부터 ‘한계효용체감의 법칙’의 3인방(윌리엄 스탠리 제번스, 레옹 발라, 카를 멩거), ‘게임 이론’의 창시자 존 폰 노이만, 시카고학파의 시조 밀턴 프리드먼…</span>

투자에 실패한 사람들은 정부 탓, 사회 탓을 한다. 자신의 욕망과 무지를 자책하는 사람은 없다. 투자 수익을 올릴 땐 자신의 능력이고, 손실을 보면 금융감독원이 세금만 받아먹고 하는 일이 없어서 그렇다고 말한다.

 『금융시장의 포식자들』은 때로 아플 정도로 시장경제의 민낯에 대해 얘기한다. 금융시장에서 포식자로 자리잡은 대기업, 최대주주, 기관, 글로벌 기업, 이웃나라인 일본과 중국에 대해 그동안 우리는 잘못된 시각을 지니고 있었다.

대기업 승계와 지배구조 개편 이면의 돈의 흐름, 글로벌 기업들의 한계와 솔루션, 지정학적으로 밀접한 관계를 맺고 있는 일본과 중국의 경제에 대한 냉혹한 판단까지 금융시장을 이끌어가는 포식자들의 면면을 통렬히 해부하고 있다. 이 책의 핵심 메시지는 이렇다. 돈을 벌기 위해서라면 그동안 낡은 피식자의 프레임을 벗어 던지고 포식자의 논리를 깨달아야 한다고 말이다.

프롤로그 _시장에 대해서는 낙관하되 현실에서는 냉철해져라

포식자 마인드 체크포인트

첫 번째 포식자, 대기업
당신이 삼성을 보는 시각은 틀렸다
재벌 개혁? 웃기지 마. 목적은 돈이잖아
SK의 미래가 SK하이닉스인 이유
삼성물산과 제일모직의 합병, 한국인으로서 부끄럽다?
전문 경영인은 연봉을 위해 일한다
가난한 사람은 절대 모르는 부자의 고통

전문 경영인과 오너 경영인, 누가 옳은가?
대기업 총수 절반이 범법자인 나라, 정상입니까?
작가의 직설 / 라이벌 LG화학과 SK이노베이션의 쌍둥이 같은 물적 분할

포식자 행세하는 피식자, 노조
대체 가능한 인력일수록 노조에 목을 맨다
애플, 테슬라, 구글, 페이스북은 왜 노조를 싫어할까?
희망 없는 도요타의 미래가 일본의 미래다
투자자 노후는 불안한데 노조는 착실히 밥그릇을 챙긴다
기업의 가장 큰 죄는 부도덕이 아니라 이윤을 못 내는 것이다
노조가 없는 산업은 대체 불가한 미래 산업이다
작가의 직설 / 링컨은 노예를 해방할 생각이 없었다

두 번째 포식자, 기관
단타 치는 기관 관계자들이 왜 밖에서는 장기 투자를 추천할까?
ESG는 미래가 아니라 지독한 이기주의다
작가의 직설 / 힘없는 피식자가 공정을 부르짖는다

세 번째 포식자, 글로벌 기업
테슬라교 교주 일론 머스크가 바라는 건 믿음이 아니라 헌금이다
노조가 없어서 발전한 테슬라, 노조가 없어서 망한다
포식자들은 신화 너머의 추락을 늘 염두에 두고 있다
아마존은 내려갈 일만 남았다
시장의 한계를 인지한 상상력이 돈이 된다
작가의 직설 / 스파에서 대기업 부회장을 마주치다

네 번째 포식자, 이웃나라 일본과 중국
일본 산업은 외래종 유입을 반대하는 섬에 갇혔다
세계 1등이라서 쓰러질 수밖에 없는 시총 1위 도요타
욕망이 없으면 부의 전환도 없다
피로 얻은 건 빼앗기지 않는다
일본 정치인, 너 이름이 뭐니?
일본을 기다리는 건 디폴트의 늪이다
한국을 미워하는 건 일본이 열등하다는 증거다
작가의 ...

투자에 성공한 수많은 사람의 필승 전략이 책, 유튜브에 넘쳐나는 지금도 여전히 실패하는 사람이 많은 이유는 무엇일까? 그 이유는 투자에 정답이 없기 때문이다. 무조건 성공한다는 비법도 개개인이 처한 상황과 심리에 따라 수익률이 천차만별로 달라진다. 투자의 원리, 자산배분과 장기투자의 이유를 스스로 이해하고 체득하지 않는 이상, 수익은 운으로 잠깐 얻는 것일 뿐 평생 불안하고 초조한 투자를 이어갈 수밖에 없다.

『사경인의 친절한 투자 과외』는 금융&amp;증권 업계의 스타 강사 사경인이 사랑하는 가족에게 직접 전한 8번의 투자 강의를 엮은 책이다. 여의도 증권인이 아닌 코스피, 코스닥도 모르는 왕초보 아내의 눈높이에 맞춰 차근차근 풀어낸 친절한 이 책에는 사랑하는 가족이 누구보다 안정적이고, 현명한 투자를 하길 바라는 사경인 회계사의 진심이 담겨 있다.

프롤로그 내가 없어도 투자를 이어갈 당신을 위해

오리엔테이션 아내는 왜 주식투자가 배우고 싶어졌을까?
여보, 나도 주식 좀 가르쳐줘
1:1 원격 강의를 시작하다
투자의 단계와 방법은 다양하다! 하지만 투자를 잘하기 위해서는 많은 공부가 필요하다
투자에 사용하는 평균부터 다시 배우자
이지영의 생각 내가 잘 배울 수 있을까?
사경인의 생각 버핏은 왜 아내에게 자신의 유산을 인덱스펀드에 맡기라고 했을까?
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 주식투자 전 마음 다잡기

1일차 주식과 부동산, 뭐가 더 좋을까?
강남 아파트 대신 삼성전자 샀으면, 타워팰리스가 3채?
우량주를 사서 장기투자하라는 미신
사례가 아닌 통계를 봐라
코스피지수와 아파트가격지수를 비교해 보자
다 더해서 나누는 산술평균, 다 곱해서 나누는 기하평균
더하기 평균의 단리수익률과 곱하기 평균의 복리수익률
자료의 둔갑술에 속지 마라
주식과 부동산, 180번의 진검승부
하지만 이겨도 이긴 게 아니다
수익률만 쫓다 놓치게 되는 중요한 한 가지 
이지영의 생각 걱정보다는 훨씬 재미있고, 이해가 쉽네
사경인의 생각 사례와 통계를 구분하는 습관이 필요하다 
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 과거와 지금의 수익률을 비교해 보자

2일차 투자의 가성비를 따져보자
가격의 변동성은 왜 위험이 될까?
투자할 때 겪는 마음고생을 가늠하는 지표
가격지수의 상승률만 비교해서는 안 된다
주식보다 부동산이 낫다! 하지만…… 
나눠서 투자하면 좋은 수학적인 이유
돈을 나누는 것과 시간을 나누는 것의 차이
거꾸로 하는 잘못된 투자
손실게임을 수익게임으로 바꾸는 도박사의 공식
고수와 똑같이 투자해도 나만 손해가 나는 이유
자산배분이 먼저다
이지영의 생각 조급해하지 말고, 하나씩 천천히 배워가자
사경인의 생각 도박과 투자는 한 끗 차이
보충수업 투자 성과를 비교하는 다양한 지표들 
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 직접 MDD를 계산해 보자

3일차 자산배분, 어떻게 할 것인가?
얼마까지의 MDD를 견뎌낼 수 있는가?
큰 욕심 안 부리고 1년에 20% 수익만 내고 싶다?

제1차 세계 대전이 시작될 무렵, 어느 한 젊은 학자가 사이드카가 달린 오토바이를 타고 런던으로 떠났다. 당시 잉글랜드에는 역사상 가장 지독한 금융 위기가 터진 지 5일 째가 되는 날이었고, 유럽을 휩쓸어버린 전쟁이 본격적으로 시작되는 시기였다. 영국은 전쟁과 경제 위기로 촉발된 공포와 혼란으로 가득했다. 

젊은 학자는 이러한 위기와 혼란을 잠재울 수 있는 획기적인 방법을 제안하였다. 영국은 젊은 학자의 제안을 받아들였고, 긴박한 위기 상황에서 벗어날 수 있었다. 런던을 위기에서 탈출하게 만든 젊은 학자는 바로 존 메이너드 케인스였다. 그는 이 사건을 통해 무명의 학자에서 당대 가장 영향력 있는 지식인으로 자리 잡을 수 있었다.

베테랑 저널리스트 재커리 D. 카터는 그의 첫 번째 책에서 존 메이너드 케인스의 개인적인 삶과 학문적, 문화적, 정치적 활동을 절묘하게 엮어낸다. 흔히 케인스는 뛰어난 경제학자로만 알려져 있다. 그러나 카터는 케인스가 탁월한 반권위주의 사상가였으며, 예술과 사상이 전쟁과 결핍을 정복할 수 있다는 믿음에 평생을 바쳤던 인물이었음을 그의 생애를 통해 소개한다. 

도덕 철학자, 정치 이론가, 정치가이기도 했던 케인스는 예술가와 지성인의 안식처인 런던 블룸즈버리 그룹에서부터 유럽과 미국 두 대륙의 주식 시장 붕괴, 뉴햄프셔 브레튼우즈에서의 협상, 런던의 호화로운 코벤트 가든에서 열린 발레 공연, 베르사유 조약이 이루어진 파리 회의에 이르기까지 다양한 역사적 순간에서 두각을 나타냈다. 이처럼 카터는 케인스의 다채로운 면모를 보여주면서 단순히 경제학자로 국한될 인물이 결코 아니라는 사실을 깨닫게 한다.

동시대 디지털 기술세계의 확대에 의해 파생되는 ‘피지털’계의 등장을 주목한다. ‘피지털’은 ‘피지컬’과 ‘디지털’을 합친 조어로, 두 공간 지각이 뒤섞인 혼합 현실을 지칭한다. 『피지털 커먼즈』는 거의 모든 유무형 자원을 포획하고 뭇 생명을 예속화하려는 플랫폼자본주의의 인클로저 질서에 맞서서 지속가능한 공통의 미래 대안을 찾기 위한 시도이다. 현실과 가상의 경계가 무너지는 ‘피지털’ 현실에서 우리는 어떤 호혜의 공통장을 기획할 수 있을까? 

오늘날 플랫폼자본주의는 디지털계의 기술 논리를 갖고 물질계의 지형과 배치를 좌우하는 역전된 현실을 만들어내고 있다. 우리 사회가 ‘메타버스’에 바치는 숭고와 찬양은 플랫폼 자본이 주도할 피지털계의 인클로저를 알리는 서곡에 해당한다. 이 책은 피지털계의 자본주의적 왜곡을 경고한다. 인간 삶의 조건을 위협하는 이 플랫폼 인클로저 질서를 넘어설 수 있을까? 

이 책은 플랫폼 질서에 맞서 다른 삶의 직조를 위해 그리고 대안 실천의 무기력을 깨우기 위한 방법으로서 ‘커먼즈’(공통장) 운동을 제안한다. ‘인류세’ 국면 인간-기술-생태의 앙상블을 도모하기 위한 전제 조건은 무엇인가? ‘인류세’ 국면 생태 커먼즈의 구성 논의는 동시대 가장 화급한 쟁점이다. 특히 『피지털 커먼즈』는 생태 커먼즈의 구성에 있어서 인간 기술과 뭇 생명과…</span>

빅 데이터 연구를 꿈꾸는 초보 연구자를 위한 김종엽 교수의 R 통계 분석 안내서. 저자가 빅 데이터 연구의 권위자로서, 빅 데이터의 올바른 활용을 위해 선결되어야만 하는 프로그래밍 언어 R의 사용법을 자신의 유튜브 채널에서 3년간 강의한 내용과, 건양 대학교 의과 대학 학생들에게 진행한 수업 내용을 책으로 엮은 결과물이다. 

컴퓨터에 익숙하지 않은 의과 대학생을 대상으로 한 이 수업에서, 그는 작업 전 원자료를 정리하고 오류를 줄이는 과정부터 R에 데이터를 불러오는 방법, R을 활용해 그래프를 생성하고 상관 분석, 푸아송 분석, 생존 분석 같은 각종 분석을 하는 방법까지 메디컬 빅 데이터 연구에 필요한 모든 과정을 총 17개의 강의에 녹여냈다.
