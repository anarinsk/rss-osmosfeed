                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: New Home Sales: Record 109 thousand homes have not been started
Brief excerpt: 
Sales, year to date in 2021, are 4.4% below sales in 2020, and new home sales in 2021 will finish solidly below sales in 2020 - since sales in 2020 finished strong.
This graph shows new home sales for 2020 and 2021 by month (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
The year-over-year comparisons were easy in the first half of 2021 - especially in March and April. However, sales will likely be down year-over-year for the remainder of 2021 - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
...
The next graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction. “Months of supply” is inventory at each stage, divided by the sales rate.
  The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 38 thousand in October, just above the record low of 33 thousand in March, April, May and July 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (red line). This is about half the normal level.
The inventory of new homes under construction is at 3.9 months (blue line) - well above the normal level. This elevated level of homes under construction is due to supply chain constraints.
And a record 109 thousand homes have not been started - about 1.8 months of supply (grey line) - almost double the normal level. Homebuilders are probably waiting to start some homes until they have a firmer grasp on prices.

Personal income increased $93.4 billion (0.5 percent) in October according to estimates released today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Disposable personal income (DPI) increased $63.0 billion (0.3 percent) and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $214.3 billion (1.3 percent).
Real DPI decreased 0.3 percent in October and Real PCE increased 0.7 percent; goods increased 1.0 percent and services increased 0.5 percent. The PCE price index increased 0.6 percent. Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index increased 0.4 percent.
 emphasis added
The October PCE price index increased 5.0 percent year-over-year and the October PCE price index, excluding food and energy, increased 4.1 percent year-over-year.

                    <span>The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 745 thousand.
The previous three months were revised down significantly. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in October 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 745,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 0.4 percent above the revised September rate of 742,000, but is 23.1 percent below the October 2020 estimate of 969,000.

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.
New home sales are now declining year-over-year since sales soared following the first few months of the pandemic.
The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply.
The months of supply increased in October to 6.3 months from 6.1 months in September. 
The all-time record high was 12.1 months of supply in January 2009.  The all-time record low was 3.5 months, most recently in October 2020.
This is slightly above the normal range (about 4 to 6 months of supply is normal).
&quot;The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of October was 389,000.  This represents a supply of 6.3 months at the current sales rate.&quot;
The last graph shows sales NSA (monthly sales, not seasonally adjusted annual rate).
In October 2021 (red column), 59 thousand new homes were sold (NSA).  Last year, 78 thousand homes were sold in October.
The all-time high for October was 105 thousand in 2005, and the all-time low for October was 23 thousand in 2010.
This was well below expectations of 801 thousand SAAR, and sales in the three previous months were revised down significantly.  I&#x27;ll have more later today.</span>

                    <span>From the BEA: Gross Domestic Product, Third Quarter 2021 (Second Estimate); Corporate Profits, Third Quarter 2021 (Preliminary Estimate)
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter of 2021, according to the &quot;second&quot; estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 6.7 percent.
The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the &quot;advance&quot; estimate issued last month. In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 2.0 percent. The update primarily reflects upward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and private inventory investment.

Here is a Comparison of Second and Advance Estimates.  PCE growth was revised up from 1.6% to 1.7%. Residential investment was revised down from -7.7% to -8.3%. This was at the consensus forecast.</span>

                    <span>We study how organizational boundaries affect pricing decisions using comprehensive data from a large U.S. airline. We document that the firm&#x27;s advanced pricing algorithm, utilizing inputs from different organizational teams, is subject to multiple biases. To quantify the impacts of these biases, we estimate a structural demand model using sales and search data. We recover the demand curves the firm believes it faces using forecasting data. In counterfactuals, we show that correcting biases introduced by organizational teams individually have little impact on market outcomes, but coordinating organizational outcomes leads to higher prices/revenues and increased dead-weight loss in the markets studied.</span>

                    <span>Future electricity systems with tight constraints on carbon emissions will rely much more on wind and solar generation, with zero marginal cost, than today. We use capacity expansion modelling of Texas in 2050 to illustrate wholesale price distributions in future energy-only, carbon-constrained grids without price caps under a range of technology/system assumptions. Tightening carbon emissions constraints dramatically increases the frequency of very low prices. The frequency of high prices also increases, and all resources earn the bulk of their energy market revenues in relatively few hours. The presence of demand response, long-duration energy storage, dispatchable low-carbon generation, or a robust market for hydrogen for non-electricity use (and for energy storage) weakens but does not undo these results. Financial instruments to hedge price volatility will consequently be more costly and it is likely that we will need to redesign capacity remuneration mechanisms to provide adequate incentives for optimal investment in VRE generation and, particularly, storage. In order to encourage economy-wide electrification, the marginal retail price of electricity should be low whenever the wholesale price is low.  With automated control of demand via demand response contracts, the risks of price volatility faced by retail customers can be mitigated without sacrificing efficiency. To encourage economy-wide electrification, the marginal retail price of electricity should be low when the wholesale spot price is low. We discuss ways of reducing consumers’ risk in this world while providing adequate investment incentives.</span>

                    <span>In a broad class of sticky price models the non-neutrality of nominal shocks is encoded by a simple sufficient statistic: the ratio of the kurtosis of the size-distribution of price changes over the frequency of price changes. We test this theoretical prediction using data for a large number of firms representative of the French economy. We use the micro data to measure the cross sectional moments, including kurtosis and frequency, for about 120 PPI industries and 220 CPI categories. We use a Factor Augmented VAR to measure the sectoral responses to a monetary shock, as summarized by the cumulative impulse response of sectoral prices (CIRP ), under three alternative identification schemes. The estimated CIRP correlates with the kurtosis and the frequency consistently with the prediction of the theory (i.e. they enter the relationship as a ratio). The analysis also shows that other moments not suggested by the theory, such as the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the size-distribution of price changes, are not correlated with the CIR . Several robustness checks are discussed</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a new measure of technological obsolescence using detailed patent data. Using this measure, we present two sets of results. First, firms&#x27; technological obsolescence foreshadows substantially lower growth, productivity, and reallocation of capital. This finding applies mainly for obsolescence of core innovation and embodied innovation, and it is stronger in competitive product markets. Second, in stock markets, high-obsolescence firms under-perform low-obsolescence firms by 7 percent annually. Using analyst forecast data, we show this is due to a systematic overestimation of future profits of obsolescent firms. The measure contains incremental information about firm innovation relative to measures focusing on new innovation.</span>

                    <span>I study unemployment insurance (UI) in general equilibrium with incomplete markets, search frictions, and nominal rigidities.  An increase in generosity raises the aggregate demand for consumption if the unemployed have a higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC) than the employed or if agents precautionary save in light of future income risk.  This raises output and employment unless monetary policy raises the nominal interest rate.  In an analysis of the U.S. economy over 2008-2014, UI benefit extensions had a contemporaneous output multiplier around 1 or higher.  The unemployment rate would have been as much as 0.4pp higher absent these extensions.</span>

                    <span>In the public imagination globalization’s adverse effects have loomed large, contributing significantly to the backlash against the political mainstream and the rise of far-right populism. The literature on trade and inequality is in fact exceptionally rich, with important theoretical insights as well as extensive empirical findings that sheds light on this recent experience. Some of the key results of this literature, discussed here, are as follows: Redistribution is the flip side of the gains from trade, and it becomes larger relative to net gains from trade in the advanced stages of globalization. Compensation is difficult for both economic and political reasons. International trade often differs from other market exchanges, raising fairness concerns in ways that domestic markets do not. The economic benefits of deep integration are generally ambiguous. Dynamic or growth gains from trade are uncertain.</span>

                    <span>Accurately determining the number of excess deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is hard. The most important challenge is accurately estimating the counterfactual count of baseline deaths that would have occurred in its absence. This analysis used new methods to: estimate this baseline metric; calculate excess deaths during the first year of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic; and examine plausibility of the excess death estimates obtained in this and prior analyses. Total, group-specific and cause-specific excess deaths in the U.S. from March 2020 through February 2021 were calculated using publicly available data covering all deaths from March 2009 through December 2019 and provisional data from January 2020 through February 2021. The estimates indicate that there were 646,514 (95% CI: 597,514 to 695,520) excess deaths in the U.S. during this period, with 83.4% (95% CI: 77.5% - 90.2%) of these attributed directly to COVID-19. There were substantial differences across population groups and causes in the ratio of actual-to-baseline deaths, and in the contribution of COVID-19 to excess mortality. Prior research has frequently underestimated baseline deaths and so has overstated excess mortality and the percentage of it attributed to non-COVID-19 causes.</span>

                    <span>This paper provides an introduction to buyouts and the academic literature about them. Buyouts are initiated by “buyout funds”, which are limited partnerships raised from mostly institutional investors. The funds earn returns for their investors by improving the operations of the firms they acquire and exiting them for a profit. Buyout funds have grown substantially and currently raise more than $400 billion annually in capital commitments. We first discuss the institutional environment that developed to foster such buyouts and to provide incentives for general partners and firm managers to earn returns for the fund’s investors. We then describe various strategies that funds use to increase the values of their portfolio companies. The paper provides up to date statistics on all aspects of the buyout industry. Finally, we present a summary of the academic literature on buyouts. This literature has paid particular attention to the extent to which buyouts earn risk-adjusted abnormal returns for their investors, as well as the sources of those returns.</span>

                    <span>We study the relationship between international trade and development in a model where countries differ in their capability, goods differ in their complexity, and capability growth is a function of a country’s pattern of specialization. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for international trade to increase capability growth in all countries and, in turn, to push all countries up the development ladder. This occurs because: (i) the average complexity of a country’s industry mix raises its capability growth, and (ii) foreign competition is tougher in less complex sectors for all countries. Empirically, we provide causal evidence consistent with (i) using the entry of countries into the World Trade Organization as an instrumental variable for other countries’ patterns of specialization. The opposite of (ii), however, appears to hold in the data. Through the lens of our model, these two empirical observations imply dynamic welfare losses from trade that are small for the median country, but pervasive and large among a number of African countries.</span>

                    <span>Recent observations on countries like the UK that have accumulated a large fraction of inoculated individuals suggest that, although initially, vaccines have little effect on new infections they strongly reduce the share of mortality out of a given pool of infections. This paper examines the extent to which this phenomenon is more general by testing the hypothesis that the ratio of current mortality to lagged infections is decreasing in the total number of vaccines per one hundred individuals. This is done in a pooled time-series, cross-section sample with weekly observations for up to 208 countries. The main conclusion from the statistical analysis is that, passed a certain threshold, vaccines moderate the share of mortality from a given pool of lagged infections. This is essentially a favorable shift in the tradeoff between life preservation and economic performance. Controlling for income per capita, stringency of containment measures, and the fraction of recovered and old individuals, estimation is carried out by linear least squares, with standard errors clustered by country and region. The main result is robust to sensitivity analysis with a logarithmic specification. The practical lesson is that, in the presence of a sufficiently high share of inoculated individuals, governments can shade down containment measures, even as infections are still rampant, without significant adverse effects on mortality.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies asymmetry in economic activity over the business cycle. It develops a tractable multisector model of the economy in which complementarity across inputs causes aggregate activity to be left skewed with countercyclical volatility. We then examine implications of the model regarding the time-series skewness of activity at the sector level, cyclicality of dispersion and skewness across sectors, and the conditional covariances of sector growth rates, finding support for each in the data. The empirical skewness of employment growth, industrial production growth, and stock returns increases with the level of aggregation, which is consistent with the model&#x27;s implication that it is the nonlinearity in the production structure of the economy that generates the skewness. Other prominent models of asymmetry are not able to simultaneously match the range of empirical facts that the production network model can.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we study the interplay between sovereign risk and global financial risk. We show that a substantial portion of the comovement among sovereign spreads is accounted for by changes in global financial risk. We construct bond-level sovereign spreads for dollar-denominated bonds issued by over 50 countries from 1995 to 2020 and use various indicators to measure global financial risk. Through panel regressions and local projection analysis, we find that an increase in global financial risk causes a large and persistent widening of sovereign bond spreads. These effects are strongest when measuring global risk using the excess bond premium – a measure of the risk-bearing capacity of U.S. financial intermediaries. The spillover effects of global financial risk are more pronounced for speculative-grade sovereign bonds.</span>

                    <span>This paper provides a novel perspective on the Great Migration out of the U.S. South. Using a shift-share identification strategy, we show how millions of Southern white migrants transformed the cultural and political landscape across America. Counties with a larger Southern white share by 1940 exhibited growing support for right-wing politics throughout the 20th century and beyond. Racial animus, religious conservatism, and localist attitudes among the Southern white diaspora hastened partisan realignment as the Republican Party found fresh support for the Southern strategy outside the South. Their congressional representatives were more likely to oppose politically liberal legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to object to the Electoral College count in 2021. These migrants helped shape institutions that reinforced racial inequity and exclusion, they shared ideology through religious organizations and popular media, and they transmitted an array of cultural norms to non-Southern populations. Together, our findings suggest that Southern white migrants may have forever changed the trajectory of American politics.</span>

                    <span>We document a new fact: in U.S., European and Japanese surveys, households do not expect deflation, even in environments where persistent deflation is a strong possibility. This fact stands in contrast to the standard macroeconomic models with rational expectations. We extend a standard New Keynesian model with a zero-lower bound on inflation expectations. Unconventional monetary policies, such as forward guidance, are weaker. In liquidity traps, the government spending output multiplier is finite, and adverse aggregate supply shocks are not expansionary. The possibility of confidence-driven liquidity traps is attenuated.</span>

We demonstrate that measures of wealth (including income, house square footage, and land acreage), typically determinants of willingness to pay for environmental quality, do affect bargaining outcomes. However, race, ethnicity, and language also play important roles after conditioning upon these variables, suggesting an environmental injustice and a breakdown of efficient Coasian bargaining. We further demonstrate that failure to negotiate protections in leases leads to increased risk of future drilling violations, which are not offset by local ordinance restrictions.</span>

We combine Spring 2021 state standardized test score data with comprehensive data on schooling in the 2020-21 school year across 12 states. We find that pass rates declined compared to prior years and that these declines were larger in districts with less in-person instruction. Passing rates in math declined by 14.2 percentage points on average; we estimate this decline was 10.1 percentage points smaller for districts fully in-person. Changes in English language arts scores were smaller, but were significantly larger in districts with larger populations of students who are Black, Hispanic or eligible for free and reduced price lunch.</span>

                    <span>Forecasts of professional forecasters are anomalous: they are biased, forecast errors are autocorrelated, and forecast revisions predict forecast errors. Sticky or noisy information models seem like unlikely explanations for these anomalies: professional forecasters pay attention constantly and have precise knowledge of the data in question. We propose that these anomalies arise because professional forecasters don’t know the model that generates the data. We show that Bayesian agents learning about hard-to-learn features of the data generating process (low frequency behavior) can generate all the prominent aggregate anomalies emphasized in the literature. We show this for two applications: professional forecasts of nominal interest rates for the sample period 1980-2019 and CBO forecasts of GDP growth for the sample period 1976- 2019. Our learning model for interest rates also provides an explanation for deviations from the expectations hypothesis of the term structure that does not rely on time-variation in risk premia.</span>

                    <span>We study the relative effectiveness of administrative regulations, criminal enforcement, and civil lawsuits for combatting health care fraud. Between 2003 and 2017, Medicare spent $7.7 billion on 37.5 million regularly scheduled, non-emergency ambulance rides for patients traveling to and from dialysis facilities, with dozens of lawsuits alleging that Medicare reimbursed rides for patients who did not meet the requirements for receiving one. Using a novel data set and an identification strategy based on the staggered timing of regulations and lawsuits across the United States, we find that a regulation requiring prior authorization for ambulance reimbursements reduced spending much more than criminal and civil lawsuits did. Despite the sharp drop in both ambulance transports and the companies that provide them following prior authorization, patients’ health outcomes did not change, indicating that most rides were not medically necessary. Our results suggest that administrative actions have a much larger impact than targeted criminal enforcement, providing novel evidence that regulations may be more cost-effective than ex post ligation for preventing health care fraud.</span>

The analysis identifies benefits as well as costs. Among the former, one of the most important is lower costs for migrants’ remittances. Some of the costs of global CBDCs are associated with currency substitution, sudden currency depreciations, and lower seigniorage. At the global level, a smooth rollout of CBDCs in center countries requires international coordination. In addition, emerging countries will benefit from the implementation of stronger macroprudential regulations</span>

                    <span>The increased popularity of college Grade Forgiveness policies, which allow students to retake classes and substitute the new grades for the previous grades in their GPA calculations, is controversial yet understudied. Our paper is the first to ask whether such policies benefit students and how. To answer these questions, we use student-level admissions and transcript data from a four-year public institution in the U.S. that underwent two major changes in its GPA policy. We find that Grade Forgiveness significantly incentivizes students, especially students with the strongest academic preparation, to take STEM courses and challenging courses and to enroll in more credits. The increased variations in within-term grades suggest that students may change their effort allocations between courses taken in the same semester and spend more effort on courses that promise a higher grade in return. We also find that repeaters whose first attempted grades are forgiven are more likely to persist in the failed subject and obtain better grades subsequently. Finally, we see an increase in graduation in STEM majors for students who were intensively exposed to this policy.</span>

                    <span>Although economic theory suggests that the federal government can influence spending by states through subsidies to programs that states operate, no recent work has quantified the magnitude of this effect for Medicaid, the largest program of this type in the U.S. We find that Medicaid spending per enrollee responds to the magnitude of the federal subsidy. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its subsequent interpretation by the Supreme Court gave states the option to expand eligibility for their Medicaid programs in exchange for increases in the generosity of the federal subsidy. States that exercised this option increased Medicaid spending per enrollee on enrollees who were eligible even before the ACA by approximately 15 percent. Depending on the specification, this translates into an elasticity of Medicaid spending per enrollee with respect to the after-subsidy price of Medicaid to a state of -0.494 to -0.579.</span>

                    <span>We analyze mortgage lenders’ behavior with respect to shale gas risk during the period of the U.S. shale gas boom, which coincided with fluctuations in the U.S. housing market and increased scrutiny in the lending industry.  Shale gas operations have the potential to place affected houses into technical default such that government sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are unable to maintain them in their portfolios.  We find that lenders changed from being willing to pay $814 on average to avoid one unit of shale risk before the financial distress of 2008 and subsequent increased scrutiny, to $3,137, or 1.6% of profit earned on an average mortgage, afterwards.  Our approach provides an alternative to the traditional property value hedonic measurement of the disamenities associated with shale gas development by looking at the decisions of mortgage professionals.</span>

                    <span>The authors use data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (C-NLSY79) to examine gender differences in the associations between child behavioral problems and early adult earnings. They find large and significant earnings penalties for women who exhibited more headstrong behavior and for men who exhibited more dependent behavior as children. In contrast, there are no penalties for men who were headstrong or for women who were dependent. While other child behavioral problems are also associated with labor market earnings, their associations are not significantly different by gender. The gender differences in headstrong and dependent behavior are not explained by education, marriage, depression, self-esteem, health, or adult personality traits. However, one potential explanation is that these gender differences are a consequence of deviations from gender norms and stereotypes in the workplace.</span>

                    <span>Central bank digital currency has become a major preoccupation of central bankers. In a new CEPR eBook, academics and policymakers review what we know about the economic, legal, and political implications, discuss current projects, and look ahead. While consensus on the ‘right’ CBDC choices remains elusive, common perspectives emerge. First, money, banking and payments are ripe for upheaval, with or without CBDC. Second, the key risk of CBDC is unlikely to be bank disintermediation – privacy, politics, and information may be more critical. Third, the use case for CBDC must be clarified country by country, and may not exist. Fourth, parliaments and voters should have the final say.</span>

                    <span>The collapse of global trade during the COVID-19 crisis was stunning in its magnitude, but was milder in relative terms than during the Global Crisis. Based on data from 40 different countries, this column suggests that the key lies in the composition of demand. The contributions of consumption and services sector demand to the import contraction were notably larger during the COVID-19 crisis. This may have led to a relatively milder import contraction, as consumption and services production are less import-intensive than investment and manufacturing production.</span>

                    <span>Concerns have been raised over whether the massive public loan guarantee schemes introduced to provide emergency lending to firms soon after the onset of Covid-19 may end up benefiting banks more than firms hit by the pandemic shock. This column uses a novel credit register dataset to show that in the euro area, government guarantees contributed to the continued extension of credit to relatively creditworthy firms hit by the pandemic, but also benefited the balance sheets of banks to some extent. Some credit substitution occurred, and therefore some guarantees transferred pre-existing credit risk from banks to taxpayers.</span>

                    <span>The global footprint of Chinese banks is substantial and growing, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. While they are similar to other banks from emerging countries in terms of their ownership and asset structure, their global footprint often resembles that of banks from advanced countries. Geographical distance acts as a barrier for Chinese banks’ lending, comparable to that for US or European banks. Also like their US peers, the lending of Chinese banks strongly correlates with trade. Some differences are present, such as an atypical negative correlation between bank lending and portfolio investment.</span>

                    <span>Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in October was 1.32%, down from 1.46% in September.  Freddie&#x27;s rate is down year-over-year from 2.89% in October 2020.
Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.10%, down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Final Look: Local Housing Markets in October
Excerpt: 
Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported in October. For these markets, inventory was down 5.9% in October MoM from September, and down 26.5% YoY.
Of these markets, inventories in Jacksonville, Miami and San Diego are at record lows. Sacramento and Washington, D.C. are the only markets with inventory up YoY in October (Austin is essentially unchanged YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 24.5% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market.
In California, the C.A.R. reported inventory was down 18.3% YoY, but this isn’t included in the table since C.A.R. doesn’t report monthly numbers.

                    <span>Last month, in the Real Estate Newsletter, I wrote: The Coming Deceleration in House Price Growth
Here is an update to the graph:
Not only is Case-Shiller released with a lag (the release next week will be for September, whereas the NAR release yesterday was for October), but the 3-month average means the September release will include sales in July and August too.
Although median prices can be distorted by the mix, and repeat sales indexes (like Case-Shiller and the FHFA) are more accurate measures of house prices, the median price index might provide earlier hints on the direction of prices.
Click on graph for larger image.
This graph - as of the NAR release in October 2020 (a year ago) - shows median prices started to take off, even though the most recent Case-Shiller report only showed a very modest pickup in prices.

This shows the lag in the Case-Shiller report.
The second graph - as of the NAR release yesterday - shows that Case-Shiller followed the median prices up, and that median prices are now falling.
 Note: the NAR YoY change in September 2021 was revised down, so there was a slight uptick in October prices YoY.


This suggests that Case-Shiller will start to show some deceleration later this year - but still be up solidly YoY.</span>

All funds experiencing inflows increased their net purchases, but this behaviour was stronger for ESG funds. Non-ESG funds experiencing outflows increased their net sales, but this was limited to their holdings of non-ESG stocks.</span>

How does the accession of countries to regional trade agreements affect multinationals’ decision to set up affiliates and produce in global value chains? Using a novel database on multinational production, this column investigates the impact of preferential trade agreements on foreign affiliates’ production activities.

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Under Pressure After Powell Nomination and Bond Auctions
Mortgage rates began the new week on a bad note with the average lender full erasing the improvement seen on Friday.  This leaves many lenders at their highest levels since April, but in those cases, it should be noted that today&#x27;s rates are extremely close to those seen in late October.  In other words, we&#x27;re essentially back in line with the highest levels in more than 7 months. [30 year fixed 3.24%]

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Existing-Home Sales Increased to 6.34 million in October
Excerpt: 
Sales in October (6.34 million SAAR) were up 0.8% from last month, and were 5.8% below the October 2020 sales rate.
Some of the increase in sales since the beginning of the pandemic was probably related to record low mortgage rates, strong second home buying, a strong stock market and favorable demographics.
Also, the delay in the 2020 buying season pushed the seasonally adjusted number to very high levels over the winter.   This means there are going to be some difficult year-over-year (YoY) comparisons in the last quarter of 2021.
This graph shows existing home sales by month for 2020 and 2021.
  This was the third month this year with sales down year-over-year. This should continue through the rest of the year, since sales averaged 6.7million SAAR over the last three months of 2020.

Existing-home sales increased in October, marking two straight months of growth, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Two of the four major U.S. regions saw month-over-month sales climb, one region reported a drop and the fourth area held steady in October. On a year-over-year basis, each region witnessed sales decrease.
  
Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, rose 0.8% from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.34 million in October. Sales fell 5.8% from a year ago (6.73 million in October 2020).

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of November 19th, inventory was at 385 thousand (7 day average), compared to 514 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 25.2%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 56.1% from 877 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 394 thousand, and was down 25.0% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 26% above the record low in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September.   Eleven weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 12.0% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for November.</span>

저소득층의 고통은 한층 커졌으며 집값은 천정부지로 뛰어 내 집 마련은 아무나 꿀 수 없는 꿈이 되고 말았다. 이렇게 무너진 한국경제를 다시 일으켜 세워야 하는 것은, 2022년 출범하는 새 정부의 숙명적 과제일 것이다. 이를 위해 국내 최고 경제정책 전문가 10인이 모여 ‘성장과 혁신’, ‘재정과 복지’, ‘부동산·금융·공정거래’, ‘노동, 저출산’ 등 9개의 어젠다를 제시한다. 

이 책에서는 정부가 추진해온 ‘소득주도성장론’과 ‘집값 안정 정책’은 실패했다고 분석하며, 경제의 기본 원리를 다시 복원해야 한다고 말한다. 저성장 극복 방안, 디지털시대의 혁신역량 강화, 국가 재정전략 수립, 주택시장 정상화 해법, 금융 산업과 서비스업의 경쟁력 제고, 초저출산 사회의 과제 등 한국경제를 정상궤도로 돌려놓기 위한 혁신전략을 담은 이 책은 대한민국의 경제 발전을 위한 가장 믿음직스러운 정책서가 되어줄 것이다.

                    <span>Despite massive digitisation efforts, the German economy has experienced a marked slowdown in productivity growth. This column shows that an important share of this trend reflects the combination of strong labour market performance with the structural shift towards services in the German economy. A large part of the productivity paradox can be resolved by the observation that the notable technological progress in the ICT-producing sector tends to stimulate aggregate employment growth in step with production growth, thereby consuming its effect on aggregate productivity. The results suggest that higher productivity growth should not be the sole policy objective.</span>

                    <span>Calling the beginning or end of a recession usually takes time.   However, the economic decline in March 2020 was so severe that the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) quickly called the end of the expansion in February.
The committee has determined that a peak in monthly economic activity occurred in the U.S. economy in February 2020. The peak marks the end of the expansion that began in June 2009 and the beginning of a recession. The expansion lasted 128 months, the longest in the history of U.S. business cycles dating back to 1854. The previous record was held by the business expansion that lasted for 120 months from March 1991 to March 2001.

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: The &quot;Household Conundrum&quot;
Excerpt: 
Housing economist Tom Lawler discusses the “household conundrum” - why it is unclear how many households there are in the U.S..
...
One of the challenges facing housing analysts in trying to assess the current and future state of the US housing market is the lack of timely and reliable estimates of the number of and characteristics of US households.  This challenge has become even more acute since the onset of the pandemic, as significant declines in response rates to government surveys of households have adversely affected the accuracy of already imperfect household estimates. The lack of reliable household data makes it difficult to assess how much of the astonishing strength in the housing market since the middle of last year has been related to “demographics,” as opposed to behavioral and preference changes associated with the pandemic and, more recently, the surge in investor purchases of single-family homes.
...
While HVS household estimates have always been volatile (partly related to the small sample size of the CPS), and have not matched decennial Census results, the estimates produced since the onset of the pandemic have been … well … ridiculous.  Below is a table of the HVS estimates of total and owner-occupied households.
As the table indicates, the number of households estimated from the HVS exploded upward following the onset of the pandemic, and the number of owner-occupied households rose by an astonishing and completely unbelievable amount.  And following that surge the HVS estimates of total households fell, and the number of owner-occupied households plummeted!

                    <span>From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.34 million in October, up 0.8% from September’s preliminary pace and down 5.8% from last October’s seasonally adjusted   pace. Unadjusted sales should show a larger YOY decline, reflecting this October’s lower business day count relative to last October’s.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that the YOY decline in the inventory of existing homes for sale was slightly larger than was the case in September.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 12.9% from last October.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release October existing home sales on Monday, November 22, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 6.20 million SAAR.   Take the over.

Note that the NAR reported median prices were up 23.6% Year-over-year (YoY) in May, 23.4% in June, 17.8% in July, 14.9% in August and 13.3% in September. And it appears the YoY growth slowed a little more in October.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: 5th Look at Local Housing Markets in October
Excerpt: 
This is the fifth look at local markets in October. This update adds Alabama, Austin, Boston, Charlotte, Indiana, Minneapolis, Phoenix, and Rhode Island.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported so far in October. For these markets, inventory was down 6.5% in October MoM from September, and down 24.1% YoY.
Of the markets that have reported so far, inventories in Jacksonville and San Diego are at record lows. Sacramento and Washington, D.C. are the only markets so far with inventory up YoY in October (Austin is essentially unchanged YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 22.1% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is slightly larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market.
In California, the C.A.R. reported inventory was down 18.3% YoY, but this isn’t included in the table below since C.A.R. doesn’t report monthly numbers.

급격한 기후변화와 코로나19로 인한 전 세계적 경제 충격으로 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 친환경적 움직임이 가속되고 있다. 전 세계 주요국은 친환경차 보급 확대를 지원하고 있으며, 이를 위한 인프라 구축에 많은 돈을 쏟아붓고 있다. 

자동차 산업과 직결되는 재생 에너지는 호시탐탐 기회를 엿보던 몇몇 국가의 새로운 성장 동력이 된 지 오래다. 또한 한국뿐 아니라 많은 나라에서 그린 뉴딜 정책으로 일자리를 창출해 코로나19로 인한 경제 침체를 극복하고자 한다. 즉 우리는 이러한 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 역학 관계에 주목할 필요가 있다.

대격변의 시대, 두 산업에서 투자자의 시선은 어디로 향할 것인가? 현대차증권의 장문수, 강동진 연구위원은 전 세계를 뒤바꿔놓을 거대한 흐름을 다각도로 분석한다. 주요국의 친환경차 관련 주요 정책 및 코로나19로 인한 경영 환경의 변화는 물론, 테슬라·도요타·폭스바겐 등 글로벌 모빌리티 기업의 친환경 대응 전략과 재생 에너지 기술의 핵심 역량을 조망한다. 이 책을 통해 에너지와 모빌리티 산업의 변화상을 들여다본다면 위기 속에서 새로운 기회를 잡을 수 있을 것이다.

‘부조리’, ‘불공정’, ‘불투명’에 맞서 싸우는 경제 전문가이자, 한국 경제 ‘팩트 저격수’로 잘 알려진 최배근 건국대 교수의 최신간. 그는 이 책에서 개혁 정부의 실패를 바라는 부패세력이 어떻게 경제적 사실을 왜곡하고, 부정적 여론으로 확산시키는지 풍부한 데이터를 통해 흥미롭게 분석한다. 

특히 ‘언론-포털-경제관료-야당’으로 이어지는 부패 기득권 카르텔에 주목하며, 그들이 어떻게 한국 경제를 ‘사익 추구’의 방편으로 활용하고 있는지 낱낱이 파헤친다. 모피아를 중심으로 한 경제관료들이 문재인 정부에서 ‘재정 안정’이라는 명목으로 소득주도성장, 부동산 세제 개편, 전 국민 재난지원금 지급 등의 개혁 정책에 맞서 ‘태업한’ 적나라한 증거들을 공개한다.

지금까지 사람들은 직장과 가족 등에서 안정감을 얻고 유대를 획득해왔다. 그러나 이제 직업은 표준과 안정이 아닌 불안정의 상징이다. 삶은 유동성에 지배되고 있다. 이에 순응하듯 긱잡, 프리터, N잡러 같은 저고용 방식들이 확산되고 있다. 결혼과 가족 또한 안전판으로서의 제도가 아닌 예측 불가능한 사건이 되었다. 그렇다면 현대인들은 이런 전통적인 공동체 대신 무엇으로부터 정체성의 위기를 해소하고 안정감과 유대감을 찾고 있을까? 바로 취향이다. 회사 회식은 싫지만 취향 모임에는 기꺼이 참석하며, 가족과 함께 TV를 보는 대신 SNS와 게임 친구들과 소통한다. 

도서출판 따비의 신간 《취향의 경제―취향의 시대는 산업과 소비를 어떻게 바꾸는가》는 취향을 추구하는 개인들이 경제와 산업을 어떻게 바꾸어냈는지를 논증하며, 취향의 추구가 불평등과 혐오를 완화하는 방향으로 나아가려면 무엇이 필요한지 모색한다.

우리 시대가 직면한 긴박한 문제들―이민, 세계화, 자동화와 실업, 경제 성장과 불평등, 기후변화, 정부의 역할 등―을 해결하려면 경제학이 필요하다. 하지만 경제학은 지금까지는 너무나 경직적인 이상의 세계에서 이론적 모델과 같은 대안만 내놓았다. 저자들은 마치 저 높은 하늘에만 떠 있던 경제학을 우리가 살고 있는 땅, 즉 현실로 끌고 내려와 실증 근거들을 기반으로 우리 사회의 큰 문제들을 실제로 해결하기 위한 방법을 파고든다. 

노벨상 수상 경제학자 배너지와 뒤플로는 경제학이 제대로만 수행된다면 (그러니까 ‘좋은 경제학’이) 우리 시대의 가장 첨예한 사회적, 정치적 난제들을 해결하는 데 일조할 수 있다고 말한다. 이주 문제부터 불평등까지, 성장의 둔화부터 기후변화의 가속화까지, 우리는 거대한 어려움에 직면해 있다. 하지만 그 어려움을 헤쳐 나갈 수 있는 자원과 역량이 없는 것도 아니다.

이 책은 우리에게 이런 문제들을 해결할 새로운 관점을 독창적이고 도발적이며 시의적절하게 제시한다. 저자들의 깊은 통찰을 통해, 아슬아슬한 균형 위에 서 있는 우리 세계의 문제점과 역량 모두를 더 올바르게 이해할 수 있게 될 것이다.

초등 사회 교과에 등장하는 경제 개념 24개를 한 컷의 그림으로 표현해 어른은 물론 아이도 이해하기 쉽게 표현한다. 그리고 그 24개의 개념을 확장하여 부모와 아이가 함께 돈에 대해 생각하고 이야기 나눠본 뒤 실천할 수 있는 재테크 활동 팁을 ‘돈 레시피’ 형태로 제공한다.

저자는 이 책을 통해 어른과 아이 스스로 “살면서 얼마만큼의 돈이 있으면 부자인가?”에 대한 기준을 세우라고 강조한다. 그 기준이 있어야 그에 필요한 재테크 활동과 투자 금액을 설정할 수 있고, 스스로의 기준이 있으면 타인과의 비교로 불행해하거나 돈 자체를 숭배하지 않을 수 있기 때문이다.

‘오늘날 화폐 시스템은 어떻게 만들어졌을까? 달러 중심의 화폐 시스템은 언제까지 유효할까? 달러를 대체할 화폐는 무엇일까? 과연 국가권력으로부터 독립된 화폐 시스템을 만들 수 있을까? 비트코인과 디지털 화폐의 미래는?’

이런 질문에 분명한 답을 제시하는 책이 출간돼 화제다. 출간되자마자 입소문을 타며 아마존 베스트셀러가 되었고 세계 각국에서 출간되고 있는 는 화폐의 역사를 ‘계층 화폐(Layered Money)’라는 획기적이고 독창적인 틀로 살펴봄으로써 대중이 화폐 시스템을 쉽게 이해하고, 개념을 재정립하도록 도와주는 책이다. 

는 인류가 주화를 처음 쓰던 때부터 금・은, 달러를 거쳐 현재 비트코인에 이르기까지 화폐 시스템이 어떻게 만들어지고 변화해 현재에 이르렀는지 ‘계층 구조’라는 렌즈를 통해 일목요연하게 보여준다. 

책은 또한 비트코인이 등장할 수밖에 없었던 필연성과 비트코인의 개념, 구조, 역할 등도 설명하고 있다. 이 여정을 따라가다 보면 우리가 쓰는 화폐와 시스템이 어떤 필요에 의해 창조되고 운영되며 또 어떤 구조적 문제를 안고 있는지 한눈에 파악할 수 있다.

노동소득만으로는 더 이상 부를 누릴 수 없는 세상이다. 자본소득이 부에 더 가까이 데려다준다는 데 이견을 내는 사람은 없을 정도로 재테크는 기본적 소양이 되었다. 하지만 금융시장의 나눌 몫은 정해져 있다. 소수가 먼저 가져가면 나머지의 삶은 팍팍해지는 이치인 것이다. 투자하지 않으면 이주당하는 시대에서 우리는 자꾸만 돈을 버는 방법에 시야를 가둔다. 과연 금융시장은 투명하고 우리는 노력만으로 돈을 벌 수 있을까? 

이 책의 저자는 15년 동안 국내 최고의 애널리스트로 일하며 금융시장에서 큰 부를 거머쥔 사람과 순식간에 돈을 잃은 사람을 만나왔다. 그리고 한 가지 사실을 깨달았다. 돈을 버는 일은 예측할 수 없지만, 돈을 절대 잃지 않는 방법은 존재한다는 것이다. 이 책은 역사적으로 다양하게 나타난 금융 사기 사건을 파헤침과 동시에 그 안에 숨겨진 돈을 잃지 않는 절대 공식을 소개함으로써 우리의 자산을 안전하게 지킬 수 있는 방법에 대해 안내한다.

코로나 팬데믹이 던지는 메시지는 간단하다. 이와 같은 “극한 상황”이 언제 어디서든 벌어질 수 있으며, 우리의 경제와 삶은 생각보다 쉽게 무너질 수 있다는 것이다. 저자에 따르면 향후 10년 가장 중요한 추세는 “고령화, 디지털화, 불평등화” 3가지다. 현재도 우려를 자아내는 이 추세는 앞으로 더욱 심화하면서 분열과 갈등을 증폭하고 경제만이 아니라 정치, 사회 전반에서 대격변을 불러올 것이다.

극한에 대비하려면 극한에서 배우는 것이 가장 좋다. 이 전략에 따라 저자는 4대륙 9개국 16만 킬로미터를 가로지르는 “극한 경제 여행”을 떠난다. 이 책에서 만나는 여행지는 최선의 성공을 거둔 3곳(아체, 자타리, 루이지애나), 최악의 실패를 겪은 3곳(다리엔, 킨샤사, 글래스고), 최첨단의 미래를 달리는 3곳(아키타, 탈린, 산티아고)이다. 거의 또는 전혀 알려지지 않은 곳들이지만 극한 여행지로는 최고의 핫 스폿들이다. 

최악의 상황에 직면한 곳들이 살아남아 회복하고 성장하는 비결은 무엇인가? 반대로 최고의 조건을 갖춘 곳들이 참담한 실패와 몰락을 겪는 이유는 무엇인가? 임박한 미래를 선도하는 곳들은 어떤 충격과 도전에 직면하며 어떻게 대응하는가? 생생하고 감동적인 일상의 풍경과 현장의 목소리, 풍성하고 날카로운 연구 데이터와 역사를…</span>

휴렛팩거드의 HP연구소 산하 경제실험실 머니랩에서 한 사람과 돈이 움직이는 방식을 다룬 실험경제학의 모든 연구 결과를 총망라하고 있다. 머니랩이란 ‘돈Money과 실험실Laboratory’을 합쳐 만든 용어이다. 휴렛팩커드에서 기업 최초로 머니랩을 설치하고 실험경제학을 통해 ‘돈이 움직이는 방식’을 연구했는데 그 결과를 총망라해 소개하고 있다.

실험경제학은 최근 주목받는 행동경제학 분야 중에서도 최첨단 영역으로 사람들이 의사결정을 하는 심리, 그 과정, 그리고 돈을 둘러싼 거래와 계약, 협상 등의 상황에서 실제로 어떻게 움직이는지 파악하기 위해 현실과 거의 유사한 실험 환경하에서 데이터를 도출하는 학문이다. 구글, 야후, 이베이 등 전자상거래의 규칙이나 운용 시스템을 만들어야 하는 기업뿐 아니라 피앤지, 존슨앤드존슨, 히타치 등 유수의 기업들이 촉각을 곤두세우며 관심을 보이는 책 속 실험경제학의 연구 결과들은 독자들에게 흥미롭게 다가온다.

HP연구소의 머니랩에서 한 경제 실험 결과를 통해 인간을 이해하게 된다면 인간을 예측할 수 있게 되고 그럼 게임의 법칙을 설계할 수 있게 된다. 즉 삶에서도 비즈니스에서도 게임의 법칙을 설계할 수 있게 되는 것이다. 이 책은 바로 그 사람들의 심리, 행동, 철학 그 …</span>

대한민국은 그동안 크게 성장했다. 하지만 성장의 후유증 또한 크다. 국가 성공을 위해 희생했던 개인의 때늦은 보상의 욕구가 분출하고 있다. 자유민주주의에서 자유의 시장경쟁 원칙이 무너지고 민주의 법치주의가 위협받고 있다. 

외교와 안보에서도 극심한 분열과 혼란을 보이고 있다. 여기에 경제는 계속해서 추락하고 사람들의 좌절과 분노 그리고 갈등은 좀처럼 진정될 기미가 보이지 않고 있다. 국민적 에너지인 역동성마저 저하되고 있다.

방향은 목표이고 길은 그곳에 이르는 과정이다. 2022년 대선을 향한 경쟁의 총성이 울린 현재, 심학봉 전 의원은 국가가 당면한 이러한 문제들의 올바른 방향성을 재설정하고, 국가가 나아갈 새로운 길을 제안한다.

서문
제1부 성공에 취해 그림자를 놓치다
1. 한국에 발을 들인 리바이어던 / 2. 그 시절, 국가들이 힘을 키운 방법 / 3. 회색코뿔소가 우리에게로 온다 / 4. 줄 서지 말고 손잡고 걸어가자! / 5. 해가 저무는 국가들의 모습

제2부 대한민국은 힘이 세다! 우리가 할 수 있는 것
1. 더 이상 아이 울음소리가 들리지 않는다 /  2. 우리 모두 평등하다는 진리를 잊지 않기 /
3. 시대가 변했다 좋은 일자리도 변했다 /  4. 새로운 대한민국의 시작? 교육혁신부터! 
 
제3부 천천히 오래도록 함께 가자
1. 지속가능한 사회, 아름다운 미래의 길 / 2. 다시 만드는 대한민국 ‘우리’공동체 / 3. 대한민국 경제의 중심, 중산층을 살려라 / 4. 강한 국가는 무엇을 가지고 있을까? / 5. 뿌리 깊은 국가정신을 만들자 / 6. 정치적 편향! 이제는 정말 끝내야 해! 

제4부 원 팀이 되면 못 할 것이 없다
1. 모든 국민이 깨어 있는 그날까지 / 2. 국민과 국가가 함께 걷는 평화의 길 / 3. 국민의 행동력이 나라를 움직인다

                    <span>Last summer’s mass mobilization for racial justice sparked debates around how to combat entrenched racial inequality in the United States. Recent corporate diversity initiatives, while a step in the right direction, are not sufficient to topple structural racism in the economy. One of the most striking dimensions of inequality in the United States is the […]

이와나미 시리즈. 노벨 경제학상 후보로 거론되기로 했던 세계적인 경제학자 모리시마 미치오. 2004년 사망했지만, 이미 국내에서도 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》 등으로 유명한 그는 LSE 교수로 역임하면서 세계적으로 이름을 날리기 시작했다. 그는 친 자본주의와 자유주의 성향인  노벨 경제학상 선정 위원회의 경향에 맞지 않아 경제학상 수상에는 실패했으나, 일본 경제 위기를 진단하는 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》로 우리에게도 많은 교훈을 준다. 

이 책은 모리시마 미치오가 NHK에서 강의한 내용을 바탕으로 마르크스, 미제스, 케인스를 추가하여 11명의 유명 경제학자들의 사상에 관해 설명하고 있다. 방송을 기본으로 했기 때문에 어려운 근대경제학 역사를 좀 더 쉽고 정확하게 이해하는 데 도움이 된다.

근대경제학이 마주한 당시 시대 상황은 두 차례 세계대전과 대공황으로 점철된 격변의 시기였다. 그렇기에 당연히 새로운 경제 체제가 모색되었고, 많은 경제학자들이 경제학과 사회학의 종합화를 제창하였다. 저자 역시 이러한 경제학의 과제가 21세기까지도 유효하다고 보고 이 책을 집필하였다. 

책에 서술한 경제학자들이 자기 분야의 협소한 경제이론을 파고들기만 한 학자가 아닌 인간과 사회의 큰 틀에서 경제를 바라본 학자들 위주로 선정한 것도 그러한 까닭이다. 이것이 이 책의 가장 큰 장점이라 하겠다.

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.

개발자에게 바치는 머신러닝 가이드북이다. 철저하게 개발자의 시선에서 접근하고 실제 산업계에서 자주 사용되는 모델에 관해 설명한다. 동시에 신경망의 원리와 기초 구현 방법, 케라스 라이브러리의 사용법과 텐서플로를 활용한 모델 배포 방안도 포함한다. 복잡한 머신러닝 이론 대신, 간단한 AI 구현 코드를 보여주면서 구조와 프로세스를 설명한다. 그리고 초보 학습자가 궁금해할 문제를 선별하여 이러한 문제와 연계해 새로운 내용을 소개한다. 이 책의 모든 장에서 비슷한 방법을 사용하고 있다.

모든 국민에게 조건 없이 일정한 금액의 돈을 정기적으로 지급하는 기본소득. 모두에게 속한 ‘공유부’를 분배하자는 것이다 보니 돈이 많은 부자에게도 지급한다. 게다가 일을 하지 않아도 주는 무조건성의 원칙 때문에 자칫 사람들의 노동의욕을 꺾는 것은 아닐지, 기본소득 도입으로 선별 복지의 수혜자들에게는 오히려 복지가 줄어드는 것은 아닐지 의문이 꼬리에 꼬리를 문다.

기본소득이 화두가 되면서 여전히 많은 사람들이 의구심을 갖고 있다. 하지만, 소모적인 논쟁 대신 기본소득이 정확히 어떤 개념이며, 어떤 원칙을 가진 제도인지 꼼꼼하게 알아볼 필요가 있다. 

어려운 경제개념을 쉽고 재미있게 이해할 수 있도록 만화로 구성된 이 책은 기본소득의 원리와 5대 원칙, 기본소득이 탄생한 역사적 배경과 경제철학을 소개하는 것은 물론이고, 기본소득을 둘러싼 여러 의혹들을 명쾌하게 해명, 실제 입법이 되려면 어떤 숙의 과정이 필요한지, 재원 마련은 어떻게 하는지, 적정한 지급액은 얼마로 추정하는지 등 기본소득을 둘러싼 모든 개념과 궁금증을 해소해준다.

‘금의 가격’은 전 세계적인 경제 위기 때마나 가파른 상승세를 보이며 급등했다. 멀게는 1929년 대공황 때부터 가깝게는 2008년 세계금융위기를 거치며 급등을 반복, 2011년에는 1온스당 장중 1,900달러 선을 돌파하며 사상 최고점을 찍었다. 이를 통해, 경제 위기→양적완화→달러 가치 하락→금의 급등으로 이어지는 흐름이 공식처럼 굳어졌다.

2019년, 코로나 팬데믹이 전 세계를 강타하고, 각국의 경제가 위기에 빠지자, 다시 ‘금의 가격’이 요동치고 있다. 거기에 더해, 이미 바닥을 드러낸 금의 추정 매장량과 달러의 대량 공급 등이 과거 경제 위기 때보다 금의 가격 상승 요인을 더욱 풍부하게 뒷받침하고 있다. 2008년 세계금융위기 때 위기를 기회로 바꿨던 전설적 투자가들이 다시 금에 집중하는 이유다.

구독경제는, 사용자(구독자)가 일정 기간 동안 일정 금액, 즉 구독료를 내고 원하는 상품이나 서비스를 제공받는 경제활동을 말한다. 이전부터 있었지만, 새롭게 주목받고 있는 유통 서비스이다. 용도에 따라 변화를 추구하고 그에 따른 경험을 누리는 것, 그것이 주는 가치가 매우 중요해진 요즘 시기에 주목하지 않을 수 없다.

현 MZ세대는 직접 하는 요리나, 청소 등 집안일에 들어가는 시간을 아끼고 출퇴근 시간에 들어가는 시간을 아껴서 자신에게 투자하는 것을 선호한다. 자신이 좋아하는 취미활동을 하는 데 시간과 돈과 에너지를 아끼지 않는다. 이러한 현상은 젊은 세대일수록 뚜렷하게 나타난다.

아직 경제활동을 하는 1인 가구라면 내가 가장 중요하기 때문에 무엇을 하든 가장 효율적인 방법을 찾기 마련이다. 내가 가장 즐겁고 행복해지는 방법을 우선적으로 찾으며, 나에게 다양한 경험을 주는 것들에 흔쾌히 마음을 내어줄 것이고 그것들에 가치와 의미를 부여할 것이다. 즉 이러한 소비자의 입맛에 맞추어 소비자가 원하는 유무형의 아이템을 제공한다는 것이 구독경제의 핵심이다.

인간과 시공간이라는 물리적 한계를 넘어 그 속에서 상호 융합 및 공진화하게 될 메타버스 글로벌 시장! 지금까지 계속 관망만 해 왔다면, 이제는 마지막 기회가 될 메타버스에 과감히 탑승하길 바란다. 앞으로 AR·VR 등 XR 기반의 기업들과 AI, 블록체인 기업들이 힘을 합쳐 지속적으로 메타버스 기술 개발을 이끌어가야 할 것이다. 

메타버스 시장은 2020년 50조 원, 2023년 535조 원 이상, 2030년에는 1,700조 원가량 성장할 전망이며, 우리나라는 향후 5년간 2.6조 원의 메타버스 관련 예산을 단계적으로 집행할 예정이다. 그렇다면 그 주인공은 누가 될 것인가? 현재로서는 예측이 불가하지만 문화와 IT 기술, 콘텐츠 강국인 대한민국이 그 주인공이었으면 하는 바람이다. 그리고 그 변화의 바람에 나도 함께할 것이다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

이 책의 예제 코드와 함께 홈페이지 회원들에게만 제공하는 회원특전 PDF는 예제와 라이브러리 사용법 간이 매뉴얼로 성안당 홈페이지(www.cyber.co.kr) [도서몰]에 회원가입 후 [자료실]-[자료실] 바로가기에서 도서 검색을 통해 다운로드할 수 있다.

어떻게 하면 이 시대 청년들에게 꿈과 희망을 줄 수 있을까? 이 시대적 과제에 대한 해결책을 모색하고자 뜻을 같이하는 교수 6명이 이 책을 집필하게 되었다. 더 이상 강단에서 지켜보지만 말고 시대에 역행하는 모순을 바로잡아야만 한다는 사명감에서 출발하였다. 

흔히 우리는 기술혁신이 일자리를 빼앗고 소득 양극화를 심화시킬 수 있다고 오해하기 쉽다. 그러나 이는 편견에 지나지 않으며, 불평등 사회를 조장하는 것은 기술혁신이 아니라 그 혁신을 가로막는 제도다. 그 제도 때문에 일자리가 줄어드는 것이다.

제1장 노동시장의 이중구조와 노동조합의 사회적 책임

1. 노동조합이 노동시장 양극화를 만든 모순
기형적인 한국의 노동조합
불평등을 키우는 노동조합
모순에 빠진 한국의 노동운동

2. 노동시장은 왜 단절되었는가
노동법과 노동시장의 괴리
빈익빈부익부 만드는 노동정치
민주화와 노동운동
민주노총과 전투적 노동운동의 모순
노사정의 사회적 대화의 실패
노동의 경제민주화와 기울어진 정책무대
기업의 사회적 책임 및 공공성 강화와 고용의 왜곡
노동조합의 비정상적 운영 관행
낙후된 노동법

3. 노동조합의 사회적 책임은 우리나라만의 문제인가
노동조합의 사회적 책임
자본주의와 노동조합의 사회적 책임
정부와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：미국
정치와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：영국
복지와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：스웨덴
기술혁신과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：독일
고용과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：프랑스와 남부 유럽

4. 디지털 시대의 노동, 무엇을 어떻게 할 것인가
디지털 시대의 노동시장과 노동조합
손 놓고 있는 한국
노동개혁의 방향
일자리문제의 시각부터 바로잡자
중소기업을 고임금 일자리로 만들자
교육훈련을 사회적 권리로 만들자
후진적인 임금고용관행을 바꾸자
노동조합은 사회적 책임 강화에 나서라
노동법을 바꾸자
정치적 결단이 요구된다

제2장 최저임금제도의 역설：2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 부작용

1. 최저임금제도, 왜 사회경제적 논란이 되었나
최저임금제도의 목적
최저임금 결정 과정
2018년~2019년 2년간 29.1% 최저임금 인상안의 문제점

2014년~2017년 최저임금 인상률과 인상요인
2018년~2019년 최저임금 인상률과 그 결정요인

3. 2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 영향
최저임금을 지불할 수 없는 사업장 증가：최저임금 미만율 증가
근로자 임금결정 시 정부의 과도한 영향：최저임금 영향률 증가
과도한 최저임금 인상에 의한 소득분배 개선 악화
과도한 최저임금 인상에 ...

메타버스, OTT, 밈테크, 틱톡, 슈퍼 IP, 이커머스, 오리지널 콘텐츠…. 만약 이런 단어가 낯설다면 당신은 세상의 변화에 둔감한 사람일지 모른다. 1020세대의 전유물이라고 치부되던 뉴미디어와 그 매체가 담아내는 독창적인 콘텐츠는 이제 보편적이고 대중적인 문화로 자리 잡아가고 있다. 뿐만 아니라 유튜브와 숏폼의 인기 콘텐츠가 거시적인 사회문화 트렌드의 출발지가 되는 사례가 점차 늘어나면서, 뉴미디어 콘텐츠의 영향력이 커지고 있다.

대학에서 지난 수년간 “소프트웨어 프로그래밍(파이썬)” 과목을 강의하면서 다양한 교과서를 살펴보았다. 어떤 서적은 한 학기에 파이썬 교육을 완성하기에 분량이 너무 많았고 시간이 부족해서 적절한 교과서를 찾기 쉽지 않았다. 연세대 강의는 전교의 다양한 학생들이 수강하고 있으며 거의 대부분의 수강생들이 프로그래밍 배경이 전혀 없는 상태이다. 실제 강의는 매주 강의 2시간 및 실습(LAB) 2시간으로 진행해 왔다. 이러한 요구와 여건에 맞추어 이 책을 저술하게 되었다. 

이 책은 실제 강의 내용에 기반하여 LAB 내용(연습문제의 B. 따라하기 실습 및 C. 프로그래밍 실습)을 구성하였다. 수강생들은 LAB 내용(B. 따라하기 실습)을 그대로 따라함으로써 파이썬 언어를 익히고, 간단한 프로그래밍 문제(C. 프로그래밍 실습)를 LAB 시간 내에 완성하는 방식을 따랐다. 이 책을 사용하는 모든 사람이 이와 동일한 방법으로 비교적 단시간 내에 파이썬 언어의 모든 것을 배우고 활용 능력을 발휘해 나갈 수 있을 것이다.

                    <span>DNA databases have become essential for finding suspects. But they also provide a powerful tool for deterring crime, says Jennifer Doleac, whose paper appeared in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics. We spoke with her about how DNA registration reduces recidivism.</span>
