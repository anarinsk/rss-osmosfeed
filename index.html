                    <span>We construct measures of industry performance and welfare in the U.S. car and light truck market from 1980-2018. We estimate a differentiated products demand model for this market using product level data on market shares, prices, and product characteristics, and consumer level data on demographics, purchases, and stated second choices. We estimate marginal costs under the conduct assumption of Nash-Bertrand pricing. We relate trends in consumer welfare and markups to industry trends in market structure and the composition of products, like the rise of import competition, the proliferation of SUV&#x27;s, and changes in vehicle characteristics. We find that although prices rose over time, concentration and market power decreased substantially. Consumer welfare increased over time due to improving product quality and falling marginal costs. The fraction of total surplus accruing to consumers also increased.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we develop a novel dataset of weekly economic conditions indices for the 50 U.S. states going back to 1987 based on mixed-frequency dynamic factor models with weekly, monthly, and quarterly variables that cover multiple dimensions of state economies. We show that there is considerable heterogeneity in the length, depth, and timing of business cycles across individual states. We assess the role of states in national recessions and propose an aggregate indicator that allows us to gauge the overall weakness of the U.S. economy. We also illustrate the usefulness of these state-level indices for quantifying the main forces contributing to the economic collapse caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and for evaluating the effectiveness of federal economic policies like the Paycheck Protection Program.</span>

                    <span>We estimate an equilibrium model of residential sorting with endogenous traffic congestion to evaluate the efficiency and equity impacts of urban transportation policies.  Leveraging fine-scale data on household travel diaries and housing transactions with home and work locations in Beijing, we jointly estimate travel mode and residential location decisions. The estimation highlights the importance of incorporating work commute in housing decisions and features preference heterogeneity for the ease of work commute by gender. Counterfactual simulations show that while different policies can attain the same level of congestion reduction, their impacts on residential sorting and social welfare are drastically different. First, a driving restriction intensifies income-stratified urban structure where high-income households live closer to subway and work. Distance-based congestion pricing reduces the spatial separation between residence and workplace across income levels, while subway expansion does the opposite. Second,  residential sorting strengthens the effectiveness of congestion pricing in improving traffic conditions but undermines that of the driving restriction and subway expansion. Third, the driving restriction is welfare reducing as it leads to large distortions on travel choices. Congestion pricing improves welfare but is regressive, highlighting the need to recycle revenue to address the associated equity concern. Finally, congestion pricing and subway expansion when combined deliver the largest congestion relief and efficiency gain and at the same time achieve self-financing, with revenue from congestion pricing fully covering the cost of subway expansion.</span>

                    <span>We offer a novel test of whether an asset pricing model describes expected returns in the absence of mispricing.  Our test assumes such a model assigns zero alpha to investment strategies using decade-old information. The CAPM satisfies this condition, but prominent multifactor models do not.  While multifactor betas help capture current expected returns on mispriced stocks, persistence in those betas distorts the stocks&#x27; implied expected returns after prices correct. These results are most evident in large-cap stocks, whose multifactor betas are the most persistent.  Hence, prominent multifactor models distort expected returns, absent mispricing, for even the largest, most liquid stocks.</span>

                    <span>We ask whether epidemic exposure leads to a shift in financial technology usage within and across countries and if so who participates in this shift. We exploit a dataset combining Gallup World Polls and Global Findex surveys for some 250,000 individuals in 140 countries, merging them with information on the incidence of epidemics and local 3G internet infrastructure. Epidemic exposure is associated with an increase in remote-access (online/mobile) banking and substitution from bank branch-based to ATM-based activity. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we show that heterogeneity in this response centers on the age, income and employment of respondents. Young, high-income earners in full-time employment have the greatest propensity to shift to online/mobile transactions in response to epidemics. These effects are larger for individuals in subnational regions with better ex ante 3G signal coverage, highlighting
the role of the digital divide in adaption to new technologies necessitated by adverse external shocks.</span>

                    <span>Orcinus Orca is the world&#x27;s largest predator, and simultaneously a significant tourist asset and cultural icon for much of the Pacific Northwest.  In the past two decades, the Southern Resident Killer whales (SRKW) have declined by more than 25 percent, and this population appears on a slow-motion path towards extinction.  This paper combines elements from biology and economics to put forward a new methodology for investigating their collapse and presents empirical work supporting its novel explanation - the Orca Conjecture.  The key mechanism is ecological - Gause&#x27;s law of competitive exclusion - combined with a shock coming from booming trade with Asia. Using three different empirical methods drawn from economics, I find the attendant noise disturbance from increased ship traffic post-1998 has lowered births and raised deaths significantly, placing the SRKW on a slow-motion path towards extinction.</span>

                    <span>We use stock exchange message data to quantify the negative aspect of high-frequency trading, known as “latency arbitrage.” The key difference between message data and widely-familiar limit order book data is that message data contain attempts to trade or cancel that fail. This allows the researcher to observe both winners and losers in a race, whereas in limit order book data you cannot see the losers, so you cannot directly see the races. We find that latency-arbitrage races are very frequent (about one per minute per symbol for FTSE 100 stocks), extremely fast (the modal race lasts 5-10 millionths of a second), and account for a remarkably large portion of overall trading volume (about 20%). Race participation is concentrated, with the top 6 firms accounting for over 80% of all race wins and losses. The average race is worth just a small amount (about half a price tick), but because of the large volumes the stakes add up. Our main estimates suggest that races constitute roughly one-third of price impact and the effective spread (key microstructure measures of the cost of liquidity), that latency arbitrage imposes a roughly 0.5 basis point tax on trading, that market designs that eliminate latency arbitrage would reduce the market&#x27;s cost of liquidity by 17%, and that the total sums at stake are on the order of $5 billion per year in global equity markets alone.</span>

                    <span>Entrepôts are hubs that facilitate trade between multiple origins and destinations. We study these entrepôts, the network they form, and their impact on international trade. We document that the trade network is a hub-and-spoke system, where 80% of trade is shipped indirectly—nearly all via entrepôts. We estimate indirect-shipping consistent trade costs using a model where shipments can be sent indirectly through an endogenous transport network and develop a geography-based instrument to estimate economies of scale in shipping. Counterfactual infrastructure improvements at entrepôts have on average ten times the global welfare impact of improvements at non-entrepôts.</span>

                    <span>Who bears the consequences of administrative problems in healthcare?  We use data on repeated interactions between a large sample of U.S. physicians and many different insurers to document the complexity of healthcare billing, and estimate its economic costs for doctors and consequences for patients.  Observing the back-and-forth sequences of claims&#x27; denials and resubmissions for past visits, we can estimate physicians&#x27; costs of haggling with insurers to collect payments.  Combining these costs with the revenue never collected, we estimate that physicians lose 17% of Medicaid revenue to billing problems, compared with 5% for Medicare and 3% for commercial payers.  Identifying off of physician movers and practices that span state boundaries, we find that physicians respond to billing problems by refusing to accept Medicaid patients in states with more severe billing hurdles.  These hurdles are just as quantitatively important  as payment rates for explaining variation in physicians&#x27; willing to treat Medicaid patients.  We conclude that administrative frictions have first-order costs for doctors, patients, and equality of access to healthcare.</span>

                    <span>Platforms are growing increasingly powerful, raising questions about whether their power might be exercised with bias. While bias is inherently difficult to measure, we identify a context within the music industry that is amenable to bias testing. Our approach requires ex ante platform assessments of commercial promise - such as the rank order in which products are presented - along with information on eventual product success. A platform is biased against a product type if the type attains greater success, conditional on ex ante assessment. Theoretical considerations and voiced industry concerns suggest the possibility of platform biases in favor of major record labels, and industry participants also point to bias against women. Using data on Spotify curators&#x27; rank of songs on New Music Friday playlists in 2017, we find that Spotify&#x27;s New Music Friday rankings favor independent-label music, along with some evidence of bias in favor of music by women. Despite challenges that independent-label artists and women face in the music industry, Spotify&#x27;s New Music curation appears to favor them.</span>

                    <span>Estimation and testing of factor models in asset pricing requires choosing a set of test assets. The choice of test assets determines how well different factor risk premia can be identified: if only few assets are exposed to a factor, that factor is weak, which makes standard estimation and inference incorrect. In other words, the strength of a factor is not an inherent property of the factor: it is a property of the cross-section used in the analysis. We propose a novel way to select assets from a universe of test assets and estimate the risk premium of a factor of interest, as well as the entire stochastic discount factor, that explicitly accounts for weak factors and test assets with highly correlated risk exposures. We refer to our methodology as supervised principal component analysis (SPCA), because it iterates an asset selection step and a principal-component estimation step. We provide the asymptotic properties of our estimator, and compare its limiting behavior with that of alternative estimators proposed in the recent literature, which rely on PCA, Ridge, Lasso, and Partial Least Squares (PLS). We find that the SPCA is superior in the presence of weak factors, both in theory and in finite samples. We illustrate the use of SPCA by applying it to estimate the risk premia of several tradable and nontradable factors, to evaluate asset managers’ performance, and to de-noise asset pricing factors.</span>

It has the longest follow-up of any experimentally evaluated early childhood education program. We follow participants into late midlife as well as their children into adulthood. Impacts on the original participants and their children generate substantial benefits.

We characterize equilibrium and optimal policies. Search scope is constant and independent of search outcomes as long as no member leaves. It declines after departures. A simple drawdown stopping boundary governs each agent’s search termination. We show the emergence of endogenous exit waves, whereby possibly heterogeneous agents cease search all at once.</span>

                    <span>We argue that alternative COVID-19 vaccine dosing regimens could potentially dramatically accelerate global COVID-19 vaccination and reduce mortality, and that the costs of testing these regimens are dwarfed by their potential benefits. We first use the high correlation between neutralizing antibody response and efficacy against disease (Khoury et. al. 2021) to show that half or even quarter doses of some vaccines generate immune responses associated with high vaccine efficacy. We then use an SEIR model to estimate that under these efficacy levels, doubling or quadrupling the rate of vaccination by using fractional doses would dramatically reduce infections and mortality. Since the correlation between immune response and efficacy may not be fully predictive of efficacy with fractional doses, we then use the SEIR model to show that fractional dosing would substantially reduce infections and mortality over a wide range of plausible efficacy levels. Further immunogenicity studies for a range of vaccine and dose combinations could deliver outcomes in weeks and could be conducted with a few hundred healthy volunteers. National regulatory authorities could also decide to test efficacy of fractional dosing in the context of vaccination campaigns based on existing immune response data, as some did for delayed second doses. If efficacy turned out to be high, the approach could be implemented broadly, while if it turned out to be low, downside risk could be limited by administering full doses to those who had received fractional doses. The SEIR model also suggests that delaying second vaccine doses will likely have substantial mortality benefits for multiple, but not all, vaccine-variant combinations, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance. Finally, we find that for countries choosing between approved but lower efficacy vaccines available immediately and waiting for mRNA vaccines, using immediately available vaccines typically reduces mortality.</span>

                    <span>Even among commercially-insured individuals, opioid use disorder (OUD) is undertreated in the U.S.: nearly half receive no treatment within 6 months of a new diagnosis. Using a difference-in-differences specification exploiting the extension of insurance parity requirements for substance disorder treatment to small group enrollees in 2014, we find that parity increases utilization of residential treatment but decreases utilization of agonist medications, the standard of care. We find direct interventions to increase access to medication may be more promising: increases in the county-level share of physicians able to prescribe agonists are associated with substitution toward medication-assisted treatment.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies voting in shareholders meetings. We focus on the informational efficiency of different voting mechanisms, taking into account that they affect both management&#x27;s incentives before the meeting and shareholders&#x27; decisions at the meeting. We first focus on the case in which the management does not affect the proposal being voted on. We prove that, for any distribution of shareholdings, the one-share-one-vote mechanism (1S1V) dominates the one-person-one-vote mechanism (1P1V), independently of whether or how shareholdings correlate with information accuracy. We also show that 1S1V becomes efficient only if votes are fully divisible. Second, we consider the case in which the management decides whether to put the proposal to a vote. The properties of a voting mechanism then depend both on its voting efficiency and on how it affects managers&#x27; incentives to select good proposals. We uncover a trade-off between selection and voting efficiency underlying the comparison of 1S1V and 1P1V: the higher voting efficiency of 1S1V implies worse selection incentives. In some cases, the negative effect of worse selection incentives on shareholders&#x27; welfare can be large enough to wash out the higher voting efficiency of 1S1V.</span>

                    <span>Modernization theory is a cornerstone of much of political science, despite the mounting evidence against its predictions. In this paper, we argue that the theory&#x27;s failings are rooted in predictions that are not conditioned on history and cultural configurations. We outline a theory in which the interplay of the distribution of political power and cultural configurations lead to three distinct self-reinforcing paths of political development, with very different state-society relations, institutions, and economic structures. These are paths to Despotic, Absent and Shackled leviathans. The role of cultural configurations, made up of attributes in a society&#x27;s culture set, is critical in legitimizing the social arrangements in each path. For example, a Despotic Leviathan, as in China, cannot be understood without appreciating how Confucian culture has been used to bolster a worldview in which rulers are supposed to be virtuous and regular people are discouraged from political participation. We argued that this interpretation is not inherent to Confucian thought, but has to be understood as an endogenous outcome along the trajectory to the Despotic Leviathan. None of the three different paths we highlight support modernization theory. Under the Absent Leviathan, there is no economic modernization. Under the Despotic Leviathan, economic growth bolsters the existing regime and its supporting cultural configuration, with no tendency towards democracy or associate political changes. Under the Shackled Leviathan, there are dynamics leading to economic growth and political changes with greater bottom-up participation. Nevertheless, the causation does not go from the former to the latter, and these changes are critically dependent on cultural and political entrepreneurship in order to formulate and popularize new cultural configurations and institutionalize political changes.</span>

                    <span>Police body-worn cameras (BWCs) have been the subject of much research on how the technology’s enhanced documentation of police/citizen interactions impact police behavior. Less attention has been paid to how BWC recordings affect the adjudication of citizen complaints against the police. We employ citizen complaint data from the Chicago Police Department and Civilian Office of Police Accountability filed between 2012-2020 to determine the extent to which BWC footage enhances the efficacy of evidence used to formulate a conclusion of responsibility, and whether bias against complainants based on race would subsequently be reduced. Accordingly, we exploit the staggered deployment of BWCs across 22 Chicago police districts over time to estimate the effect of BWCs on these outcomes. Our findings indicate that BWCs led to a significant decrease in the dismissal of investigations due to insufficient evidence (&quot;not sustained&quot;) as well as a significant increase in disciplinary actions against police officers (&quot;sustained&quot; outcomes”) with sufficient evidence to sanction their misconduct. We further find that disparities in complaints across racial groups for the “unsustained” category fade away with the implementation of BWCs.</span>

&quot;The Orange County office market struggled again in 2Q. It had already been slowing before the pandemic hit, and by virtue of the higher employee density and multi-tenant configuration of office product, the office sector was hit harder by COVID than other sectors. Vacancy and availability both moved higher, and net absorption remained in negative territory. Average asking lease rates were relatively flat, but they alone do not tell the full story, as landlord concessions have risen sharply and are not reflected in market metrics.

This graph from the Minnesota Realtors® shows inventory in Minnesota since 2012.  Inventory had been trending down, and then was somewhat flat for a few years, and then declined significantly during the pandemic.
Active inventory was up 14.2% from the previous month, and up 24.6% seasonally from the all time low in February 2021.   Usually, at this time of the year, we&#x27;d expect active inventory of around 23,000 in Minnesota, so current inventory is still extremely low.</span>

I&#x27;m looking at data for some second home markets - and will track those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through June 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.
  
   Click on graph for larger image.
Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Note that inventory was high while prices were declining - and significantly lower inventory in 2012 suggested the bust was over.  (Tracking inventory helped me call the bottom for housing way back in February 2012, see:The Housing Bottom is Here)
Currently inventory is still very low, but solidly above the record low set three months ago, and prices are up sharply YoY.   This will be interesting to watch.</span>

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.9 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.6 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. This was the largest 1-month change since June 2008 when the index rose 1.0 percent. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.4 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending August 2008.
  
The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 10.5 percent in June. This increase accounted for more than one-third of the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.8 percent in June, a larger increase than the 0.4-percent increase reported for May. The energy index increased 1.5 percent in June, with the gasoline index rising 2.5 percent over the month.
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.9 percent in June after increasing 0.7 percent in May. Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel. The index for medical care and the index for household furnishings and operations were among the few major component indexes which decreased in June.
The all items index rose 5.4 percent for the 12 months ending June; it has been trending up every month since January, when the 12-month change was 1.4 percent. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.5 percent over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1991. The energy index rose 24.5 percent over the last 12-months, and the food index increased 2.4 percent.

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: MBS RECAP: Still on a Fence as Bonds Work Through Early-Week Risks
We closed out last week on a fence about the short term outlook for rates.  On the one hand, Friday was fairly weak.  On the other hand that weakness followed 3 great days of gains and could furthermore be rationalized as defensive positioning ahead of early risks in the week ahead.  We made it through half of those risks on Monday (3 and 10yr Treasury auction) with minimal damage, but certainly no major gains.  As such, bonds look like they&#x27;re keeping their options open for now.  We hope to get a better lay of the land after tomorrow&#x27;s events (CPI and 30yr bond auction).  [30 year fixed 3.09%]

                    <span>There are many ways to select and retain public officials in representative democracies, and considerable variation in the rules governing that process. This column discusses the literature on selection and retention procedures for low-information public office, and suggests a conceptual framework for assessing the advantages and disadvantages of direct elections. After summarising the historical origins of the institutional factors that influence elections, the authors suggest avenues for future research aided by the digitisation and improved textual analysis of media coverage and government data.</span>

                    <span>Pricing carbon and placing a tax on industrial emissions could be a centrepiece of national climate policies going forward. This column uses simulations from a global trade model to show that the introduction of asubstantial carbon tax for Dutch industry strongly reduces domestic emissions, while production losses remain modest. However, significant carbon leakage of up to around half of the emissions reduction achieved in the Netherlands occurs, mainly to non-European countries such as China and India.</span>

                    <span>Many analysts expected Covid-19 to expose the contradictions of ‘populist’ politicians and cited various reasons for this, including short-sightedness, the lack of trust often associated with populist sentiments, unhelpful populist narratives, and a resistance to international cooperation. This column argues that there is no clear evidence that its handling of the pandemic has ‘killed’ populism. In fact, the pandemic crisis has spawned new political issues which, if left unaddressed by traditional parties, may rekindle the growth of the populist ideology once again.</span>

                    <span>Climate change will impact those parts of the financial system most exposed to its disruptive effects. This column analyses a new financial stability risk mapping for the EU financial system, linking financial exposures of thousands of banks, insurance companies, and investment funds to millions of firms subject to climate risk. It highlights a high level of risk concentration, both in European regions subject to climate hazards as well as economic sectors with diverse carbon emission intensities. Long-term scenario analyses suggest that the risks will be best addressed through proactive policies that directly contain global temperature rises.</span>

As of July 2nd, inventory was at 373 thousand (7 day average), compared to 654 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 43.0%.


A week ago, inventory was at 373 thousand, and was down 44.0% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 21.6% above the record low in early April.

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases, although still well below a normal rate for June.</span>

Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $74.68 per barrel and Brent at $75.58 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $41, and Brent was at $43 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 80% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic).

가상화폐, 코인 시장이 무섭게 흔들리고 있다. 2020년 하반기부터 시작된 맹렬한 상승세에, 2021년 4월에 7만 달러를 넘보던 비트코인이 6월 들어 3만 달러 밑으로까지 떨어지며 요동쳤다. 중국이 채굴장을 폐쇄하고 각국 정부가 규제책을 내놓으면서 ‘코인 시장은 끝났다’는 자조도 나온다. 그런가 하면 돈나무 언니로 불리는 캐시 우드(아크 인베스트먼트 CEO)를 위시로 한 투자자들은 ‘비트코인 50만 달러 간다’면서 ‘떨어질 때가 오히려 사야 할 적기’라고 호언한다. 평범한 투자자로선 불안하기 짝이 없다. 

지금 코인에 투자해도 되는지, 어떤 코인에 투자해야 하는지 혼란스럽다. 수백 배씩 오르며 ‘돈 복사기’로 불렸던 알트코인조차 거래소가 연이어 상장폐지하면서 폭락한다. 상승과 하락 폭이 너무도 커서 시장에 대응하는 게 위태롭고 초조하다. 

그러나 변덕스런 도박판으로 치부하기에는 가상자산 시장은 이미 너무 커져 버렸다. 각국이 중앙은행 디지털 화폐(CBDC)를 속속 도입하고, 코인 비즈니스 모델은 모든 첨단 산업(메타버스, 게임, 플랫폼)과 연결되기에 미래가치가 무궁무진하다. 무작정 무시하기엔 가능성이 너무 큰 시장이다. 3년 전 1차 코인붐이 꺼질 때 코인 시장이 망할 거라 비웃던 이들은 어떻게 되었나? 2020년 눈앞에 펼쳐진 …</span>

                    <span>Rising geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions among major trade powers are undermining the rules-based multilateral trade order. A new VoxEU eBook brings together teams of mostly Chinese and European experts who focus on key challenges confronting the multilateral trading system. Pursuit of issue-specific negotiations on an open plurilateral basis offers prospects for revitalizing the WTO but does not remove the need for balance in the choice of issues put forward for negotiation and for systemic WTO reform. Joint leadership by China and the EU to establish a balanced work programme that spans both old and new issues of interest to all WTO members is a necessary condition to reboot the rules-based trade order.</span>

                    <span>Over 90,000 Americans died from opioids in the year ending November 2020, bringing the death total since 1999 to over 850,000. This column argues that rather than rising demand for opioids for relief from pain or despair, it is supply-side innovations in the legal and illegal drug markets that have been the main driver of the opioid epidemic. The opioid cycle is a cautionary tale about how technological innovation can go terribly awry, and calls for more collective scepticism about innovations that allegedly cleanse pleasure-inducing drugs of their addictive properties as well as stronger penalties for companies that mislead the public about the risks of their products.</span>

                    <span>Textbook models predict that a monetary policy tightening should lift the exchange rate. Yet the empirical evidence for emerging market economies fails to support this prediction. This column uses data from Brazil to show that the exchange rate’s response to monetary policy shocks changes with the fiscal regime. A contractionary monetary surprise leads to an appreciation in normal times. By contrast, a depreciation results when fiscal fundamentals are deteriorating and markets worry about debt sustainability.</span>

                    <span>Previous research in economics has focused on the causes of conflict, while the ending of military interventions has received less attention. This column examines the recent security transition from international troops to local forces in the ongoing civil conflict in Afghanistan using declassified data on conflict outcomes and perceptions of local security. It finds that a decline in violence during the initial phase of the security transfer was followed by an upsurge in violence once foreign troops physically withdrew, suggesting that the Taliban’s attacks have been highly strategic.</span>

                    <span>Variants of the virus causing COVID-19 account for a large part of the resurgence of infections in many OECD countries since the latter part of 2020. By relating country-level daily reproduction numbers for OECD countries to several potential explanatory factors, this column shows that vaccination has been very effective at curbing COVID-19 infections and that a quick vaccine rollout can substitute for lockdown policies at much lower costs to the economy. However, policymakers should be aware that failure to vaccinate a sufficient share of the population could lead to a resurgence of the virus in the winter.</span>

                    <span>From the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Rail Time Indicators.  Graphs and excerpts reprinted with permission. 
U.S. rail volumes in June 2021 and Q2 2021 were consistent with an economy that’s growing but  has more growing to do. Total U.S. carloads in June 2021 and Q2 2021 were up 19.1% and 23.8%,  respectively, over the same periods in 2020 as easy comps led to big year-over-year percentage gains.  That said, total carloads in Q2 2021 were the most for any quarter since Q4 2019.
...
On the intermodal side, U.S. originations in Q2 2021 were the most ever for a quarter, and  intermodal volume in the first six months of 2021 were the most ever for the first six months of a year.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
Total originated carloads were 1.18 million in  June 2021, up 19.1% (188,164 carloads) over June 2020  and down 5.5% from June 2019.
...
Carloads excluding coal were up 14.1% in June 2021 over June 2020 and down 4.3% from June 2019. 
The second graph shows the six week average of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
U.S. intermodal originations, which are not  included in carloads, rose 10.9% in June 2021 over June  2020, their 11th straight year-over-year gain. In June,  intermodal averaged 277,349 containers and trailers per  week, the second most for June on record (behind June  2018).</span>

지난 30여 년간 6번의 정권이 바뀌는 동안, 그 어떤 정부도 말하지 않은 ‘한국 경제 불변의 법칙’이 있다. 경제의 진짜 성장능력을 나타내는 장기성장률이 1990년대 초 이후 매 5년마다 1%포인트씩 미끄럼틀 타듯이 지속적으로 추락해온 ‘한국 경제 5년 1% 하락의 법칙’이 그것이다. 

이 암울한 법칙은 매우 강력하여 보수, 진보 정권에 상관없이 그 위력을 발휘해왔을 뿐만 아니라, 2003년 사스, 2015년 메르스 등 전염병 사태가 발발하고 1997년 외환위기, 2008년 글로벌 금융위기 등 경제위기가 있었지만 이 위기들 이전과 이후 상관없이 한국 경제를 주도해왔다. 

그럼에도 어떤 정부도 지속적 경제 하락 추세를 국민들에게 알리지 않았고, 표를 얻기 위해 ‘신기루 경제정책’을 펼치고도 정권을 잡았다. 그런 다음 임기 동안 단기적 성장률을 높이는 데만 집중하며 경기부양정책을 펼쳐왔다. 고통스러운 제로성장의 도래를 그 다음 정부로 떠넘기고자 ‘폭탄 돌리기’를 지속해온 것이다.

저자인 서울대학교 경제학부 김세직 교수는 첫 단독저서 『모방과 창조』를 통해 한국 경제에 이 퇴행의 법칙이 계속 작동하면 향후 장기성장률이 0%대의 제로성장에 처해 디스토피아적 상황을 맞이하게 됨을 강력히 경고한다. 소득의 극심한 감소를 피하기 위해서는, 하루 빨리 추…</span>

우리는 부동산 문제 해결이 그저 ‘정책’으로는 되지 않는다는 사실을 깨달아야 한다. 오늘날 한국 사회는 부동산으로 이득을 보는 걸 당연시하며, 그런 관점 아래 법제도와 사회구조 및 관습 등이 구성돼 있다. 한마디로 이것은 ‘체제’의 문제인 것이다. 그리하여 한국은 ‘불로소득 유발형 부동산체제’가 굳게 자리잡고 말았다. 

당연히 한두 가지 정책 도입만으로 이런 체제는 꿈쩍도 하지 않는다. 분명한 철학과 확고한 원칙, 그리고 체계적이고 종합적인 정책 패키지가 결합된 토탈 솔루션이 필요하다. 이 책 『불로소득 환수형 부동산체제론』은 체제의 관점에서 부동산 문제에 접근한 최초의 시도로, 부동산체제의 코페르니쿠스적 전환을 제안하고 있다.

&#x27;중국 특색의 사회주의&#x27;가 신시대에 접어들면서 아름다운 생활을 갈망하는 인민들의 요구는 날고 강렬해졌고, 날로 광범해졌다. 동시에 발전 불균형과 불충분으로 나타난 문제들을 해결하지 못했기에 발전 품질과 효익이 높지 못했다. 민생영역에는 아직도 많은 단점들이 있다. 사회문명은 향상되어야 하고 사회모순과 문제도 중첩되어 있다. 이 책은 시진핑 신시대 &#x27;중국 특색의 사회주의&#x27; 사상 연구를 담았다.

제1장 경제체제 개혁을 끝까지 진행하자
 1. 경제체제 개혁은 중국의 모습을 변화시켰다
  (1) 개혁은 중국경제 총량이 부단히 새로운 단계에 오르도록 했다
  (2) 개혁은 인민들의 생활을 최저생활 수준에서 전면적인 샤오캉사회로 발전시켰다
  (3) 개혁은 중국의 국제경쟁력을 현저하게 향상시켰다
  (4) 중요 영역과 관건적인 부분에서의 개혁은 돌파적인 진척을 가져왔다
 2. 개혁은 이미 관건적인 단계에 진입했다
  (1) 중국의 경제성장은 여전히 체제적 요소의 영향을 크게 받고 있다
  (2) 점진적 개혁에서 전면적 개혁의 심화로
  (3) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 일부 사람들의 이익을 건드릴 수 있다
 3. 반드시 실속 있게 개혁을 추진해야 한다
  (1) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 혁명과도 같은 것이기에 반드시 실속 있게 진행해야 한다
  (2) 개혁을 돌파할 수 있는 관건은 실시하는 데에 있다
  (3) 개혁을 하려는 자를 등용하고, 개혁을 하려하지 않는 자를 해임하는 인재등용의 방식을 지향해야 한다
 4. 오직 개혁개방 만이 중국을 발전시키고, 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다
  (1) 개혁개방은 백년 목표의 실현을 결정하는 관건이다
  (2) 경제체제 개혁은 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 중점이다
  (3) 발전을 포용하고 지속시키려면 개혁을 심화시키는 것에 의존해야 한다
  (4) 오직 개혁개방만이 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다

제2장 경제체제 개혁의 총체적 요구와 기본방향
 1. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키기 위한 총체적 요구
 2. 사회주의 공평 정의와 인민복지의 증진은 개혁의 출발점이고 목표점이다
 3. 사회주의 기본 경제제도를 견지하고 개선해야 한다
 4. 사회주의 시장경제의 개혁방향을 견지해야 한다
 5. 체제개혁의 목적과 조건
 6. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 노선도

제3장 정확하게 전면적으로 경제체제의 개혁을 심화시키기 위해서는 약간의 중대한 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 1. 사상해방과 실사구시의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 2. 신중하게 일을 처리하는 것과 상부 설계와의 관계를 잘 처리 해야 한다
 3. 증량을 추진하는 국부적인 개혁과 전면적으로 추진하는 전반적인 개혁과의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 4. 개혁ㆍ발전ㆍ안...

중국인민대학 과학연구처, 중국인민대학 국가발전과 전략연구원, 중국인민대학 “시진핑 신시대 ‘중국 특색의 사회주의’ 사상” 학습연구원 등이 공동으로 기획한 기구에서 중국인민대학 각 전공 별 영역의 전문가들을 모아 편찬했으며, 테마연구를 위해서는 국내 유관 연구기구의 연구원들을 모집했다. 

“시진핑 신시대 ‘중국 특색의 사회주의’ 사상”은 심오하고 내용도 풍부하므로 국내 학술계에서는 이 사상을 깊이 있게 연구해야 한다는 생각으로 이 사상을 연구하였다. 이렇게 하여 얻어낸 성과인 이 총서는 중국인민대학의 초보적인 결과물이라고 할 수 있다. 장차 중국인민대학은 중국인민대학 자체가 가지고 있는 전통적인 장점과 학과별 장점, 훌륭한 인재에 의지하여 이 사상을 더욱 깊이 있게 연구하여 더욱 우수한 연구 성과를 낼 수 있도록 당대 중국의 마르크스주의와 21세기 마르크스주의를 논술할 것을 기대해 마지않는다.

세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사까지 한 번에 명화로 쉽고 재미있고 빠르게 이해하는 경제 교양서. 역사를 잘 몰라도, 미술에 조예가 깊지 않아도, 경제 까막눈이어도 누구나 부담 없이 즐길 수 있는 명화 속 경쾌한 ‘경제’ 이야기. 재미있는 회계 강의로 유명한 현직 회계사인 저자답게 편안하고 재치있는 입담으로, 어렵게 느껴지던 세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사의 주요 흐름을 쉽고 재미있게 들려준다. 

중세 이탈리아에서부터 현대 미국까지 가난과 역병, 전쟁, 혁명의 위기와 불안을 극복해온 각 나라의 경험은 물론, 화가들의 반전 있는 마케팅 전략같이 생각지 못한 미술과 관련된 경제 이야기가 경쾌하게 펼쳐진다. 또 수없이 많은 위기를 되풀이해온 역사 속 인간의 다양한 경제 활동과 명화에 담긴 사람들의 욕망과 지혜에서 불안의 시대를 살아나갈 용기와 희망을 찾아볼 수 있다.

약 30년을 경제부처에 몸담았던 신윤수 저자의 정치·사회에 관한 세 번째 도서. 현재 우리 사회의 문제들을 꼬집으며 어떻게 하면 더 좋은 사회로 발전할 수 있을지, 자유민주주의, 시장경제와 ‘행복한 나라’를 위한 제언을 담았다. 이 시대에 가장 뜨거운 이슈인 ‘기본소득’을 포함하여 사회의 다양한 방향에 대한 의견을 네 파트로 나눠 이야기한다. 중간중간 저자가 직접 쓴 시도 함께 실었다.

『C++로 나만의 운영체제 만들기』의 후속편으로, 저자가 직접 제작한 YUZA OS라는 OS를 파헤쳐 보면서 운영체제의 구조와 원리를 설명한다. 리눅스 같은 기존의 운영체제 개발환경에서 벗어나 윈도우 운영체제에서 OS를 개발하며 비주얼 스튜디오 2019와 C++로 운영체제 개발 방법을 설명하는 것이 특징이다. 아울러 저자가 게임 개발자 출신답게 다양한 게임을 자신만의 OS에서 쉽게 제작할 수 있는 방법을 설명하는 것에 심혈을 기울였다.

미국의 노동 운동가이자 작가인 리오 휴버먼은 “역사책에는 이런저런 왕들의 야망과 정복 그리고 전쟁에 관한 이야기가 장황하게 이어지는데, 왕들의 이야기보다는 왕권 배후에 있는 진정한 힘, 곧 그 시대의 상인과 금융업자의 이야기에 지면을 할애하는 편이 훨씬 나았을 것이다”라고 말했다.

세계 역사를 이끌어온 힘은, 왕이 아닌 상인과 금융업자에게서 나왔다는 얘기다. 실제로 세계를 뒤흔든 전환점이라 일컫는 포르투갈의 대항해, 네덜란드 중상주의 발흥, 영국의 산업혁명과 자본주의의 전개, 신대륙의 부흥, 미국의 눈부신 성장 등은 상인과 금융업자의 역사이자, 특히 유대인에 의해 시작되고 완성된 역사라는 사실을 부정할 사람은 없을 것이다. 

『유대인 이야기』의 저자인 경제학자 홍익희는 자본주의를 탄생시키고 세계 경제를 이끌어온 유대인의 역사, 그 가운데서도 오늘날의 금융혁명을 일으키고 세계 산업을 재편한 로스차일드 가문에 주목하였다.

2장 영원한 금융 황제, 로스차일드
1. 로스차일드 가문의 탄생 69
2. 고화폐 상인에서 황실 대리인이 된 마이어 78
3. 로스차일드 시대의 서곡, 프랑스 대혁명과 나폴레옹의 등장 92
4. 영국으로 세력을 확장한 로스차일드 가문 105
5. 단기간에 유럽 금융계를 장악한 나탄 114
6. 마이어의 유언과 그가 남긴 다섯 화살 129
7. 로스차일드, 영국을 사다 137
8. 로스차일드, 세계 금본위제에 시동을 걸다 152
9. 산업혁명 전파의 원동력, 로스차일드의 자본 163
10. 나탄 잠들고 야콥의 시대로 174
11. 로스차일드 3대의 활약 182
12. 로스차일드 후손들 191

3장 커튼 뒤의 로스차일드
1. 로스차일드, 모건 시대를 열다 203
2. 미국 연방준비은행의 탄생 228

경제대항해 시대, 한국호를 둘러싼 조류와 파도, 바람, 비의 방향과 세기를 점검하고 향후 한국호의 최적 운항 전략과 방법론을 모색하고자 쓰였다. 최적의 솔루션은 외부 위기 요인과 내부 역량에 대한 엄격한 점검에서 나올 수밖에 없다. 따라서 저자는 ‘도전의 실체’와 ‘응전의 능력’을 함께 평가하는 지난한 작업을 벌이고 있다.

저자는 지난 10여 년간 언론에 게재한 칼럼들을 주제별로 나눠 이 책에 수록하였다. 칼럼을 취사선택하지 않고 있는 그대로 모두 실었다. 칼럼의 제목(큰 제목, 부제)과 내용 또한 언론에 나간 그대로이다. 단 한 자의 가필도 수정도 없었다. 동일한 주제에 대해 현재에서 과거로 거슬러 올라가는 시간의 여정을 밟고 있다. 과거의 칼럼이 현재 칼럼의 배경이자 역사가 되어 페이지를 더할수록 스스로 설명이 되는 구조를 택했다.

칼럼 뒤에는 국제분야 주요 시사용어에 대한 친절하고도 자세한 설명과 함께 현재 시점에서 필자가 칼럼에 대해 느끼는 소회와 관련 경제 지식들을 제시하였다. 특히 ‘지식 한 토막’에서는 유발 하라리와 베르베르, 폴 크루그만, 바그와티, 그레이엄 앨리슨, 마이클 스펜스 등 세계적인 작가와 학자들의 흥미진진한 분석과 이론들이 총망라되어 소개되고 있다.

2020년 벤처 투자 시장은 펀딩 6조 원 시대를 여는 새로운 역사를 썼다. 코로나19는 팬데믹이라는 유례없는 위기를 몰고 왔지만 동시에 많은 기업에게 기회의 장도 제공한 것이다. 많은 일반 투자자들의 관심이 특히 바이오 종목으로 집중되었지만 사실 수년째 바이오는 벤처 캐피털 업계(VC)에서 가장 핫한 투자 섹터로 자리 잡고 있었다. 

그중에서도 황만순 한투파 대표는 남다른 존재감을 발휘해왔다. 2020년만 해도 3,500억 원대의 바이오 섹터 펀드를 결성했고 지놈앤컴퍼니, 젠큐릭스, 엔젠바이오 등의 기업을 상장시키는 등 지금까지 바이오 헬스케어 분야에만 190여 개 기업에 7,500억 원 이상을 투자해왔다.

『대한민국 바이오 투자』는 바이오 섹터에 생소한 일반 개인 투자자의 질문에 대한 답변 형식으로 구성되었으며 바이오 섹터 투자에 있어 꼭 알아야 할 기초적인 관련 지식과 절대 실패하지 않는 투자 방식, 그리고 지녀야 할 마음가짐까지 친절하게 설명한다. 저자는 지난 20년 벤처 캐피털리스트로서 쌓은 경험을 나누고 싶어 이 책을 쓰게 되었으며 독자분들께 조금의 도움이라도 되길 원한다고 담담하게 이야기한다.

세상을 움직이는 33가지 핵심 경제이론을 깔끔하게 정리한 경제 입문서다. 리처드 세일러의 ‘넛지 이론’, 대니얼 카너먼의 ‘전망 이론’, 쉬나 아이엔가의 ‘상품 선택의 법칙’ 등 행동경제학과 게임이론에서부터 현대 화폐 이론(MMT)과 피케티의 21세기 자본론까지 꼭 알아야 할 최신 경제이론을 한 권에 담았다. 

또한 애덤 스미스의 ‘보이지 않는 손’, 리카도의 비교우위론, 케인스의 유효수요론, 슘페터의 경기순환론 등 역사적으로 중요한 경제이론들이 어떻게 발전해오며 세계를 변화시켰는지 살펴본다. 경제이론과 실물 경제가 어떤 지점에서 어긋나는지, 경제이론의 한계도 지적한다. 이 책은 세상을 움직이는 경제의 원리를 쉽지만 제대로 이해하고 싶은 사람들에게 유용한 가이드가 될 것이다.

지금은 버블인가, 아닌가? 현재 상황을 두고 개인 투자자들은 물론 전문가들도 의견이 팽팽하게 맞선다. 급변하는 현재를 어떻게 해석하고 행동을 취해야 하는가? 거대한 전환점에 서 있는 우리는 이익을 얻는 사람이 될 것인가, 잃는 사람이 될 것인가? 이 책은 인류 최초의 버블부터 현재까지 300년 역사를 뒤흔든 버블의 사태를 살펴본다. 왜, 무엇이, 버블을 만들었으며 누가 그것을 이용해 부를 잃고 누군가는 이익을 얻었는지 반복되는 호황과 불황의 주기를 바탕으로 통찰력을 제공한다.

저자들은 ‘시장성·자본·투기’가 만드는 거품 경제를 ‘버블 트라이앵글’이라고 분석하며 새로운 프레임워크를 제시한다. 역사상 버블의 사태는 이 3가지 요건의 비이성적 패턴을 가졌다는 것이다. 사회적 변화와 이슈가 있을 때마다 전 세계 경제는 대전환기를 맞아왔다. 코로나 19가 지핀 전 세계 경제 변화는 씨앗의 형태가 다를 뿐, 역사상 최초의 현상이 아니다. &#x27;파이낸셜타임스&#x27;가 선정한 올해의 책이자, 급변하는 경제 상황을 분석하고 새로운 프레임워크를 제시하는 을 통해 거인의 어깨, 놀라운 통찰에서 그 답을 구해보자.

차세대 산업혁명인 4차 산업혁명은 지금껏 상상만 해 왔던 기술들을 점차 현실화시키고 있다. 많은 이들이 우려하는 대로 이러한 기술의 진보가 인간의 일자리를 빼앗는 일이 이미 벌어지고 있다. 얼마 전까지만 해도 사람이 제공하던 서비스들을 이제 AI(인공지능)나 로봇 등의 기계가 대신 하는 일이 급속히 늘고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 본격적으로 진행될수록 이런 현상은 더욱 가속화할 것이다.

저자는 일과 일자리 관점에서 볼 때 4차 산업혁명은 인간의 사고를 뿌리까지 바꾸게 함으로써 이전과는 완전히 다른 세상을 도래하게 만드는 ‘변곡점’이 될 것이라 확신하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명을 통해 발전할 기술들로 인해 기존의 일자리 대다수가 사라질 가능성이 농후하기 때문이다. 

많은 이들이 4차 산업혁명의 기술적 성취에 취해 장밋빛 미래를 그리고 있는 지금, 저자는 다음과 같은 질문을 던진다. 4차 산업혁명이 성공적으로 마무리되고 나면 우리는 기술 진보의 혜택을 마음껏 향유할 수 있을까? 현재와 같은 우리 일자리는 남아 있을까? 그때에도 우리는 먹고살기 위해 일해야 할까? 모든 면에서 인류를 능가하는 AI가 등장해도 우리는 지금처럼 생태계 최정상의 지위를 유지할 수 있을까?

이 책은 인류 문명 탄생부터 AI와 로봇까지, 일과 일자리 변천사를 일목요연하게 정리하고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 앞선 산업혁명들과 본질적으로 어떤 차이가 있으며 어느 정도의 파급력을 가질지에 대해 통찰력 있는 전망을 내놓고 있다. 그리고 기술 진보가 예고된 미래 세상을 디스토피아가 아닌 유토피아로 만들기 위해 지금 인류가 어떤 준비를 해야 하는지에 대해서도 구체적인 방안을 제시한다.

1. AI는 인류에게 축복인가, 재앙인가?
2. 나노 기술과 생명공학
3. 통신혁명, 5G 시대를 넘어

6장 좋은 일자리를 방해하는 생각들: 미래를 억누르는 우리 내부의 ‘우상’들
1. 효율과 혁신, 빛나는 이름 뒤로 숨은 함정
2. 불평등과 능력주의가 공정하다는 착각
3. 냉정하게 바라봐야 할 경제 지표와 이론들

7장 미래 일자리를 위해 지금 해야 할 일: 사람 중심의 지속 가능한 환경 만들기
1. 기울어진 운동장 바로 세우기
2. 공정한 조세 제도 만들기
3. 최소한의 삶을 보장하고 지속 가능한 환경 만들기

[라이노 파이썬]은 라이노 환경과 사용법에 어느 정도 익숙한 독자를 대상으로 하고 있으며, 파이썬 언어를 활용한 라이노 프로그램의 조형 연구 및 제어를 다루고 있다. 이 책의 근본적인 목적은 특정 언어 및 프로그램의 사용법을 익히게 하는 것이 아니라, 건축 디지털 디자인과 관련된 프로그래밍에 대한 기본적인 이해를 돕고 3D 프로그램과의 연동 및 그 가능성을 탐구하도록 하는 것이다. 

건축 디자이너로서 프로그래밍을 어떻게 받아들여야 하는지, 프로그래밍은 무엇을 할 수 있는지, 스크립트를 쓸 때는 어떻게 생각해 나가야 하는지, 기본적인 바탕으로 숙지해야 되는 내용은 무엇인지 등 디지털 디자인에 대한 생각을 정리하고, 직접 뛰어들어 써 나갈 수 있도록 방향을 제시할 수 있는 조력자의 역할을 수행하고자 한다.

본 연구는 북한당국이 발표하는 지역별 토지가격이나 토지의 특성에 관한 자료들이 없는 조건에서 북한지역의 토지가격과 토지자산의 규모를 추정하는 방법론과 모형을 제시하고 이를 이용하여 북한 시가화지역 전체를 대상으로 시장가격 기준의 토지자산 규모를 실험적으로 추정하였다.   우선 관련 사회경제적 변수를 이용가능하면서 최근의 북한과 소득수준의 격차가 상대적으로 크지 않았던 것으로 평가되는 남한의 1970년대 중후반, 그리고 도시화 수준이 유사했던 1980년대 초반 남한의 시, 군, 구별 실거래가격을 기준으로 시가화지역 토지에 대한 지가결정함수를 도출하였다. 다음으로 북한지역에 대한 지리정보분석을 통해 도출되는 지가결정요인의 대리변수들을 대입하여 2015년경 북한 시가화지역 토지의 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율을 산출하였다. 더 나아가서 최근 북한지역 일부 도시들을 대상으로 조사된 주택거래가격과 본고에서 추정한 상대가격비율을 결합하여 북한전역을 대상으로 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모를 추정하였다.  추정결과 북한 시가화지역의 토지가격은 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율로 볼 때 평양시 동대원구역이 100으로 제일 높고 양강도 풍서군이 1.70으로 가장 낮은 것으로 평가되었다. 한편 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모는 2015년 기준 216억 달러로 추정되었는데, 이는 동년 북한GDP의 1.2~1.3배에 달하는 규모이다.  이 비율은 남한의 1978~1980년과 비슷한데, 해당시기의 남한의 경제성장률이 평균 6%인데 반해 북한은 1%대 수준인 것을 고려하면 상당히 높은 것으로 보인다.</span>

본 연구에서는 2017년과 2019년 이민자 체류실태 및 고용조사 자료를 이용하여 직업훈련 프로그램이 외국인의 노동시장 성과에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 성향점수매칭(propensity score matching)을 적용한 분석 결과를 살펴보면, 직업훈련은 평균적으로 외국인들의 고용률을 6.4%p 높였으며 월평균임금을 상승시키는 효과도 있었다. 또한, 체류자격에 따라 상이한 효과가 나타났는데 먼저 취업비자로 들어온 외국인은 훈련참여의 결과로 고용률이 크게 높아지지 않았지만 임금 상승효과는 상당히 컸다. 반면, 결혼이민자의 경우 임금에 대한 긍정적 효과가 관찰되지 않았다. 정주비자 소지자는 훈련을 통해 고용률과 임금이 모두 증가하였다.</span>

본 연구는 1981년부터 2019년까지 한국의 생산가능인구 1인당 실질 GDP 추세성장률을 추정하기 위해 추세성장률이 임의보행을 따르는 비관측요인모형을 사용한다. 추정 결과, 추세성장률은 외환위기를 극복하던 시기인 2000년 전후를 제외하고 1980년대 후반부터 2010년대 초반까지 지속해서 하락하였다. 추세성장회계를 통해 추세성장률 하락요인을 분석한 결과, 지속적인 추세성장률 하락은 노동생산성 둔화와 관련이 깊은 것으로 나타났다. 구체적으로 살펴보면, 1988년부터 1998년까지의 추세성장률 1차 하락기는 외환위기 이전부터 둔화되기 시작한 노동증강 총요소생산성에 가장 큰 영향을 받았다. 이러한 결과는 외환위기로 추세성장률이 하락했다는 가설과는 배치되는 것이다. 한편 부진한 투자는 2002년부터 2012년까지의 2차 하락기의 중요한 배경인 것으로 나타났다.</span>

개발자로 일하던 저자가 교사가 되어 학생들에게 프로그래밍을 가르친 경험을 바탕으로 집필한 책이다. 프로그래밍을 힘들어하는 학생들이 좀 더 쉽고 재미있게 프로그래밍을 받아들일 수 있는 방법을 고민한 결과가 오롯이 담겨 있다. 친숙한 실생활 사례를 예제로 구현하고, 이해하기 쉽게 비유를 들어 설명한다. 
또한, 머릿속으로 구상한 아이디어가 코드로 옮겨지는 과정을 최대한 자세히 실어 입문자가 초반에 겪는 코드 구현의 어려움을 극복할 수 있게 돕는다. 자세히 설명하고 직관적으로 이해할 수 있게 내용은 풍부하게 넣고, 가볍게 들고 다니도록 2권으로 분권 구성했다.

파이썬은 초보자부터 전문가까지 사용자층을 보유하고 있는데 그 이유는 누구나 쉽게 접근하여 대부분의 응용 소프트웨어에서 사용 가능하기 때문이다. 동적 타이핑(Dynamic typing) 범용 프로그래밍 언어로, 펄 및 루비가 있는데 파이썬과 자주 비교되지만 다양한 플랫폼에서 쓸 수 있고, 라이브러리(모듈)가 풍부하여, 대학 및 다양한 교육기관, 연구 기관 및 산업계에서 이용이 증가하고 있다. 

이 책은 파이썬에 대한 전문지식과 IT 서비스 및 인프라 구축에 필요한 모든 정보를 담았다. 순개념 익히기부터 문제 학습, 능력 넓히기, 실전문제 도전, 마스터 능력 갖추기까지 핵심을 찌르는 개념 익히기와 실전문제로 파이썬을 빠르게 학습한다. 또한 단계별 구성으로 더 체계적인 스스로 학습이 가능하다.

지난해 하반기 이후 우리나라의 금융시스템은 대체로 안정된 모습을 유지하였다. 코로나19 재확산 움직임에도 불구하고 경기회복 기대가 커지면서 금융시장은 비교적 안정세를 보였고, 금융중개기능도 원활히 작동하였다. 전반적인 금융시스템 상황을 보여주는 금융안정지수(FSI)는 작년 4월 위기단계 진입 이후 하락세를 지속하여 금년 5월에는 주의단계 임계치(8)를 하회하는 1.8(잠정)까지 낮아졌다.
    


    
금융안정 상황을 부문별로 살펴보면, 신용시장의 경우 가계와 기업 모두 차입을 늘리면서 민간신용의 높은 증가세가 이어지는 가운데 명목GDP 성장률이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 명목GDP 대비 민간신용 비율이 큰 폭 상승하였다. 가계신용은 주택 매매·전세 관련 대출 증가 등의 영향으로 증가세가 확대된 반면 가계의 처분가능소득 증가율이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 가계의 채무상환부담이 늘어났다.
    


    
기업신용도 코로나19 장기화 등에 따른 자금수요 지속 등으로 증가세를 이어갔다. 기업의 전반적인 재무상황이 개선되고 있으나 기업간 채무상환능력의 차이는 심화되었다. 한편 가계 및 기업 대출 연체율이 낮은 수준을 유지하고 있으나 향후 경기회복이 부문간·업종간 차별화되는 양상을 보일 경우 가계와 기업의 취약부문을 중심으로 부실 위험이 커질 수 있다.

이 책은 단순히 머신러닝의 알고리즘 사용법을 알려주는 것이 아니라 파이썬을 이용해 알고리즘을 처음부터 구현해봄으로써 알고리즘의 동작 원리를 이해하는 것을 목표로 한다. 따라서 현업에서 프레임워크나 라이브러리를 사용하면서 잊기 쉬운 머신러닝의 기초와 기반 구조를 이해할 수 있다. 또한 머신러닝 알고리즘을 설명하기에 앞서 머신러닝에 필수적인 수학의 기본기를 탄탄히 쌓아가기 때문에 머신러닝에 대한 응용과 문제해결 능력을 키우는 데 힘을 실어준다.

기존의 데이터 분석 및 통계학 책들과는 다르다. 실제 사회과학 분야에서 쓰이는 데이터를 먼저 접한 후 R을 사용해서 기본적인 데이터 분석과 프로그래밍을 연습하는 순서로 구성돼 있다. 데이터 분석과 통계학을 처음 배우는 모든 사람을 위한 책이며, 독자들은 데이터 분석의 재미를 발견할 수 있을 것이다. 

더 나아가 데이터 분석을 활용해 사회과학자들이 사회적 문제 및 인간 행동양식에 대한 결론과 중요한 해답을 어떻게 제시하는지 살펴볼 수 있다. 데이터 과학 분야의 실무종사자, 사회과학 분야의 학부생, 대학원생 및 연구자들에게 도움이 될 것이다.
