                    <span>Multiproduct firms are responsible for the vast majority of global trade. A prior literature examines how multiproduct firms respond to trade liberalizations that simultaneously affect all of the firms&#x27; products and inputs.  In contrast, our study uses Chinese firm-product-level export data to examine how an AD action, a very targeted trade policy against a specific product in a specific export destination, affects a multiproduct firms&#x27; price and quantity decisions across its other products and export destinations.  We find robust evidence for a new phenomenon we call within-firm cross-product trade deflection whereby an AD duty against one of the firm&#x27;s products in one of its export destinations is associated with reduced prices and increased sales of its other products across all markets. This type of effect depends on increasing costs from joint production within multiproduct firms, something that is often assumed away in many models of the multiproduct firm.  We also document for the first time a within-firm chilling effect whereby an AD action in one export destination on a product leads the firm to raise price and lower quantity of the product in other export destinations to lower the risk of AD actions in these other markets.</span>

                    <span>While the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the large costs of infectious diseases, less attention has been paid to the impacts of more common, endemic respiratory viruses that frequently circulate in the population, especially when it comes to their potential long-term consequences for population health, human capital, and economic outcomes. This paper uses Danish population-level administrative data on 35 birth cohorts of children to provide a comprehensive analysis of both the mechanisms through which infants become infected by respiratory illnesses, as well as the consequences of early-life respiratory disease exposure for their later outcomes. First, we document a striking difference in the likelihood of severe respiratory illness by birth order: younger siblings have two to three times higher rates of hospitalization for respiratory conditions before age one than older siblings at the same age. We argue that the family unit is central in virus transmission, with older children &quot;bringing home&quot; the virus to their younger siblings. We then combine the birth order variation with within-municipality variation in respiratory disease prevalence among preschool-aged children to identify differential long-term impacts of early-life respiratory illness between younger and older siblings. We find that moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the local disease prevalence distribution (&quot;disease index&quot;) is associated with a 30.9 percent differential increase in the number of respiratory illness hospitalizations in the first year of life for younger compared to older siblings. In the long term, for younger relative to older siblings, we find a 0.5 percent differential reduction in the likelihood of high school graduation, and a 1.3 percent additional reduction in age-30 earnings.</span>

                    <span>We report evidence on discriminatory behavior from the largest correspondence study conducted to date in the rental housing market. Using more than 25,000 interactions with rental property managers across the 50 largest U.S. cities, the study reveals that African American and Hispanic/LatinX renters continue to face discriminatory constraints in the majority of U.S. cities although there are important regional differences. Stronger discriminatory constraints on renters of color (particularly African Americans) are also associated with higher levels of residential segregation and larger gaps in intergenerational income mobility. Using matched evidence on the actual rental outcomes at the properties in our experiment, we show that correspondence study measurements of discrimination do indeed predict actual outcomes.</span>

                    <span>We use textual analysis of earnings conference calls held by listed firms around the world to measure the amount of risk managers and investors at each firm associate with each country at each point in time. Flexibly aggregating this firm-country-quarter-level data allows us to systematically identify spikes in perceived country risk (“crises”) and document their source and pattern of transmission to foreign firms. While this pattern usually follows a gravity structure, it often changes dramatically during crises. For example, while crises originating in developed countries propagate disproportionately to foreign financial firms, emerging market crises transmit less financially and more to traditionally exposed countries. We apply our measures to show that (i) elevated perceptions of a country&#x27;s riskiness, particularly those of foreign and financial firms, are associated with significant falls in local asset prices, capital outflows, and reductions in firm-level investment and employment. (ii) Risk transmitted from foreign countries affects the investment decisions of domestic firms.  (iii) Heterogeneous currency loadings on perceived global risk can help explain the cross-country pattern of interest rates and currency risk premia.</span>

                    <span>In a canonical intertemporal consumption problem, I show how anticipation of future consumption mistakes leads to higher current marginal propensities to consume (MPCs). This result is driven by mistakes in future consumption&#x27;s response to saving changes (i.e., changes in asset balances) and is independent of their specific behavioral foundations. My framework can accommodate many widely studied behavioral biases, such as inattention, present bias, diagnostic expectations, and near-rationality (epsilon-mistakes). This channel helps explain the empirical puzzle on high-liquidity consumers&#x27; high MPCs and can be significant. The same channel can also help explain other puzzles in intertemporal choices, such as violations of the fungibility principle, excess discounting of future income, and large risk aversion. Methodologically, I develop a general approach to study predictions of sophistication (i.e., the anticipation of future mistakes) independent of the underlying behavioral biases.</span>

                    <span>It is common to rank different categories by means of preferences that are revealed through data on choices. A prominent example is the ranking of political candidates or parties using the estimated share of support each one receives in surveys or polls about political attitudes. Since these rankings are computed using estimates of the share of support rather than the true share of support, there may be considerable uncertainty concerning the true ranking of the political candidates or parties. In this paper, we consider the problem of accounting for such uncertainty by constructing confidence sets for the rank of each category. We consider both the problem of constructing marginal confidence sets for the rank of a particular category as well as simultaneous confidence sets for the ranks of all categories. A distinguishing feature of our analysis is that we exploit the multinomial structure of the data to develop confidence sets that are valid in finite samples. We additionally develop confidence sets using the bootstrap that are valid only approximately in large samples. We use our methodology to rank political parties in Australia using data from the 2019 Australian Election Survey. We find that our finite-sample confidence sets are informative across the entire ranking of political parties, even in Australian territories with few survey respondents and/or with parties that are chosen by only a small share of the survey respondents. In contrast, the bootstrap-based confidence sets may sometimes be considerably less informative. These findings motivate us to compare these methods in an empirically-driven simulation study, in which we conclude that our finite-sample confidence sets often perform better than their large-sample, bootstrap-based counterparts, especially in settings that resemble our empirical application.</span>

                    <span>We study the labor markets in China and the United States, the two largest economies in the world, by examining the evolution of their cross-sectional age-earnings profiles during the past thirty years. We find that, first, the peak age in the cross-sectional age-earnings profiles, which we refer to as the “golden age,” stayed almost constant at around 45-50 in the U.S., but decreased sharply from 55 to around 35 in China; second, the age-specific earnings grew drastically in China, but stayed almost stagnant in the U.S.; third, the cross-sectional and life-cycle age-earnings profiles were remarkably similar in the U.S., but differed substantially in China. We propose and empirically implement a decomposition framework to infer from the repeated cross-sectional earnings data the experience effect (i.e., human capital accumulation over the life cycle), the cohort effect (i.e., inter-cohort human capital growth), and the time effect (i.e., changes in the human capital rental prices over time), under an identifying assumption that the growth of the experience effect stops at the end of one&#x27;s working career. The decomposition suggests that China has experienced a much larger inter-cohort productivity growth and higher increase in the rental price to human capital, but lower returns to experience, compared to the U.S. We also use the inferred components to revisit several important and classical applications in macroeconomics and labor economics, including growth accounting and the estimation of TFP growth, and the college wage premium and skill-biased technical change.</span>

                    <span>Many agricultural and environmental technologies require large upfront investments in exchange for longer-term benefits. This time profile of costs and benefits makes adoption particularly sensitive to liquidity and credit constraints, which are prevalent in low-income settings. We test the importance of these barriers to the adoption of an agricultural technique that helps reduce land degradation and restore soil fertility in Niger. We find little evidence that liquidity or credit constraints deter adoption: instead, providing farmers with training increases the share of adopters by over 90 percentage points, whereas adding conditional or unconditional cash transfers has no additional effect. Adoption increases agricultural output, reduces land turnover and leads to adoption spillovers up to three years after treatment. These results imply that training can be a cost-effective and scalable means of promoting the adoption of profitable technologies.</span>

                    <span>We show that borrowers are highly sensitive to the requirement of posting their homes as collateral. Using administrative loan application and performance data from the U.S. Federal Disaster Loan Program, we exploit a loan amount threshold above which households must post their residence as collateral. One-third of all borrowers select the maximum uncollateralized loan amount, and our bunching estimates suggest that the median borrower is willing to give up 40% of their loan amount to avoid collateral. Exploiting time variation in the loan amount threshold, we find that collateral causally reduces default rates by 35%. Our results help to explain high perceived default costs in the mortgage market, and uniquely quantify the extent to which collateral reduces moral hazard in consumer credit markets.</span>

                    <span>The U.S. population is aging. We examine whether immigration causally affects the likelihood that the U.S.-born elderly live in institutional settings. Using a shift-share instrument to identify exogenous variation in immigration, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the less-educated foreign-born labor force share in a local area reduces institutionalization among the elderly by 1.5 and 3.8 percentage points for those aged 65+ and 80+, a 26-29 percent effect relative to the mean. The estimates imply that a typical U.S-born individual over age 65 in the year 2000 was 0.5 percentage points (10 percent) less likely to be living in an institution than would have been the case if immigration had remained at 1980 levels. We show that immigration affects the availability and cost of home services, including those provided by home health aides, gardeners and housekeepers, and other less-educated workers, reducing the cost of aging in the community.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, the designs of many new blockchain applications have been inspired by the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) problem. While traditional BFT protocols assume that most system nodes are honest (in that they follow the protocol), we recognize that blockchains are deployed in environments where nodes are subject to strategic incentives. This paper develops an economic framework for analyzing such cases. Specifically, we assume that 1) non-Byzantine nodes are rational, so we explicitly study their incentives when participating in a BFT consensus process; 2) non-Byzantine nodes are ambiguity averse, and specifically, Knightian uncertain about Byzantine actions; and 3) decisions/inferences are all based on local information. The consensus game then resembles one with preplay “cheap talk” communications. We characterize all equilibria, some of which feature rational leaders withholding messages from some nodes in order to achieve consensus. These findings enrich those from traditional BFT algorithms, where an honest leader always sends messages to all nodes. We also study how the progress of communication technology (i.e., potential message losses) affects the equilibrium consensus outcome.</span>

                    <span>Beyond its immediate impact on public health and the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic has put democracy under stress. While a common view is that people should blame the government rather than the political system for bad crisis management, an opposing view is that dissatisfaction with government performance may cause deeper dissatisfaction with democracy even in consolidated democratic regimes. We use a pre-registered survey and experiment covering 12 countries and 22,500 respondents to examine the impact of the pandemic on public attitudes about incumbent governments, the functioning of democracy and support for different types of regimes. To estimate causal effects, we leverage experimental treatments using an instrumental variable design. We find that dissatisfaction with the government, which is equally driven by economic and health considerations, decreases satisfaction with how democracy works. However, it does not translate into an embrace of non-democratic regime types.</span>

                    <span>Why have white, less educated voters left the Democratic Party over the past few decades? Scholars have proposed ethnocentrism, social issues and deindustrialization as potential answers. We highlight the role played by the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  In event-study analysis, we demonstrate that counties whose 1990 employment depended on industries vulnerable to NAFTA suffered large and persistent employment losses relative to other counties. These losses begin in the mid-1990s and are only modestly offset by transfer programs.  While exposed counties historically voted Democratic, in the mid-1990s they turn away from the party of the president (Bill Clinton) who ushered in the agreement and by 2000 vote majority Republican in House elections. Employing a variety of micro-data sources, including 1992-1994 respondent-level panel data, we show that protectionist views predict movement toward the GOP in the years that NAFTA is debated and implemented. This shift among protectionist respondents is larger for whites (especially men and those without a college degree) and those with conservative social views, suggesting an interactive effect whereby racial identity and social-issue positions mediate reactions to economic policies.</span>

                    <span>Widely discredited ideas nevertheless persist. Why do we fail to &quot;unlearn&quot;? We study one explanation: beliefs are resistant to retractions (the revoking of earlier information). Our experimental design allows us to identify updating from retractions - unlearning - and to compare it with updating from equivalent new information - learning. Across different kinds of retractions - for instance, those consistent or contradictory with the prior, or those occurring when prior beliefs are either extreme or moderate - subjects do not fully unlearn from retractions and update approximately one-third less from them than from equivalent new information. While we document a number of well-known biases in belief updating in our data, our results are inconsistent with any explanation that does not treat retractions as inherently different. Instead, our analysis suggests that retractions are harder to process, for instance, due to the intimate reliance on conditional reasoning.</span>

                    <span>This paper summarizes the results of nearly a dozen new papers presented at the Sundance Conference on Monopsony in Labor Markets held in October 2018.  These papers, to be published as a special issue of the Journal of Human Resources, study various aspects of monopsony and failures of competition in labor markets. It also reports on the new developments in public policies associated with widespread concerns about labor market competition and efforts to ameliorate competitive failures. The conference papers range from studies of the labor supply elasticity individual firms face to studies of local labor market concentration to studies of explicit covenants suppressing labor market competition. New policies range from private and public antitrust litigation to concerns about the effect of mergers and inter-firm agreements on labor market competition. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanics of the Silicon Valley High Tech Worker conspiracy to suppress competition based on Court documents in the case. Non-compete agreements, which are not enforceable in three states already, have also come under scrutiny.</span>

                    <span>The empirical analysis of auction data has become a thriving field of research over the past thirty years. Relying on sophisticated models and advanced econometric methods, it addresses a wide range of policy questions for both public and private institutions. This chapter offers a guide to the literature by stressing how data features and policy questions have shaped research in the field. The chapter is organized by types of goods for sale and covers auctions of timber, construction and services procurement, oil and gas leases, online auctions, internet advertising, electricity, financial securities, spectrum, as well as used goods. It discusses the idiosyncrasies of each applied setting and the respective empirical findings.</span>

                    <span>We study information substitutability in the financial market through a quasi-natural experiment: the pandemic-triggered lockdown that has hampered people&#x27;s physical interactions hence the ability to collect, process, and transmit soft information. Exploiting the cross- sectional and time-series variations of lockdown, we investigate how the difficulty to use soft information has prompted a switch to hard information and its implication on fund investment, performance, and risk management. We show that lockdown reduces fund investment in proximate stocks and generates a portfolio rebalancing toward distant stocks. The re- balancing negatively impacts fund performance by reducing fund raw (excess) return of an additional 0.76% (0.29%) per month during lockdown, suggesting that soft and hard information is not easily substitutable. Lastly, we show that soft information originates mainly from physical human interactions, primarily in cafés, restaurants, bars, and fitness centers; and the virtual world based on Zoom/Skype/Team fails to substitute physical interactions fully, thus cannot provide sufficient soft information.</span>

                    <span>What drives gender wage gaps – and how best to close them – remains a contested topic of economic research. Using data from matched employer-employee registers in France from 1995 to 2015, this column finds that discrepancies in pay are driven largely by men and women working in different firms rather than similar men and women being paid differently at the same firm. Understanding why the share of the gender gap ascribed to firms persists over time and across cohorts remains an essential policy puzzle for further reducing wage disparities.</span>

But while these productivity spillovers amplify the aggregate welfare gains from local place-based policies, they widen economic disparities between individual workers and regions in the economy.</span>

                    <span>Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family Serious Delinquency decreased to 1.46% in October, from 1.62% in September. The serious delinquency rate is down from 3.05% in October 2020.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.

By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 4.02% are seriously delinquent (down from 4.25% in September).  For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 6.90% are seriously delinquent (down from 7.21%),  For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.17% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.31%). So, Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once they are employed.

Excerpt: 
Both the Case-Shiller House Price Index (HPI) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) HPI for September were released today. Here is a graph of the month-over-month (MoM) change in the Case-Shiller National Index Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
The MoM increase in Case-Shiller was at 1.18%; still historically high, but lower than the previous 13 months. House prices started increasing sharply in the Case-Shiller index in August 2020, so the last 14 months have all been historically very strong, but the peak MoM growth is behind us - and the year-over-price growth is starting to decelerate.
...

As I discussed in How Much will the Fannie &amp; Freddie Conforming Loan Limit Increase for 2022?, the FHFA HPI is used to determine the increase in the Conforming Loan Limit.  The relevant quarterly index, the Expanded-Data Indexes (Estimated using Enterprise, FHA, and Real Property County Recorder Data Licensed from DataQuick for sales below the annual loan limit ceiling), was released this morning, and it was up 18.04% YoY.   The actual 2022 CLL will be released later.

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: MBS RECAP: Bonds Find Footing After Shaky Start
This morning we found ourselves in the uncomfortable position of watching the bond market backtrack on massive gains at the end of the previous week.  This is always a risk when the market goes on a big run--especially on a Friday.  But rather than continue to erase Friday&#x27;s gains, bonds found their footing in the 10am hour as a part of a broader &quot;risk-off&quot; move. [30 year fixed 3.21%]

                    <span>Financial markets have shown contradictory reactions to the formation of populist administrations. This column, part of the Vox debate on populism, examines whether there is any systematic reason behind the radically different outcomes, using data for 331 elections in 41 EU and OECD countries. The immediate uncertainty introduced into financial markets by an increase in populist vote shares varies according to the populist host ideology. Markets are mostly suspicious of left-wing populism but view the electoral success of right-wing populist parties as unequivocally favourable, possibly because of the tendency for the political and economic elite to collude.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 recession that hit the French economy was completely non-standard, characterised by an unprecedented and sharp contraction of activity. This column discusses recent findings from the French business cycle dating committee, which show that the recession reached its trough in the second quarter of 2020. Since the third quarter of 2020, the economy has been in a recovery phase, with the majority of commercial sectors experiencing an increase in activity. Nevertheless, past experiences suggest caution about future growth, especially regarding the policy support for economic activity.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Newsletter: 2022 Housing Forecasts: Second Look
Excerpt: 
The key in 2022 will be inventory.  If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in prices.  However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.   Towards the end of each year, I collect some housing forecasts for the following year.
...

For house prices, there is a very wide spread. As of August, Case-Shiller house prices were up 19.8% year-over-year.

                    <span>From Fed Chair Powell&#x27;s prepared testimony: Coronavirus and CARES Act, Excerpt on inflation: 
Most forecasters, including at the Fed, continue to expect that inflation will move down significantly over the next year as supply and demand imbalances abate. It is difficult to predict the persistence and effects of supply constraints, but it now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year. In addition, with the rapid improvement in the labor market, slack is diminishing, and wages are rising at a brisk pace.
emphasis added
And on the new COVID variant: 
The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation. Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people&#x27;s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions.
Powell will provide his testimony tomorrow at 10AM ET: Coronavirus and CARES Act, Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs</span>

                    <span>This data is as of November 23rd.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: November Forbearance Exits Steady Heading Into Thanksgiving
Active forbearance plan numbers remained relatively steady heading into the Thanksgiving holiday, holding true to the established mid-month pattern.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans increased by 1,000 this week. A decline among FHA/VA loans (-4,000) was offset by another 5,000 rise in plan volumes among portfolio and PLS mortgages as GSE plans held steady. Both plan extensions and renewals remained steady, but low, in keeping with the typical mid-month lull.br /&gt;
As of November 23, 1.01 million mortgage holders (1.9%) of mortgage holders, remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, including 1.2% of GSE, 3.0% of FHA/VA and 2.5% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
  Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Overall, the number of forbearance plans is still down by 214,000 (-17%) from the same time last month, with the potential for additional improvements as we enter December. New plan starts, which have been relatively flat since the end of March, jumped almost 8,000 week over week, a number that will bear closer scrutiny in coming weeks to determine whether this is an anomaly or an inflection point.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of November 26th, inventory was at 375 thousand (7-day average), compared to 499 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 24.9%.  Inventory is down 2.6% from last week.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 56.3% from 859 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 385 thousand, and was down 25.2% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 22% above the record low in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September.   Twelve weeks ago, inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 14.3% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for November.</span>

                    <span>From the NAR: Pending Home Sales Jump 7.5% in October
Pending home sales increased in October, rebounding after a decline the month prior, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Contract activity rose month-over-month in each of the four major U.S. regions. On a year-over-year basis, however, transactions were split, as two regions reported drops and two others posted gains.
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, rose 7.5% to 125.2 in October. Year-over-year, signings fell 1.4%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
Compared to the previous month, contract signings rose at the strongest pace in the Midwest and South regions. Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI increased 6.9% to 99.5 in October, a 10% drop from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index climbed 11.8% to 124.6 last month, up 5.1% from October 2020.
Pending home sales transactions in the South rose 8.0% to an index of 149.7 in October, up 0.6% from October 2020. The index in the West grew 2.1% in October to 107.5, down 6.2% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was well above expectations of a 1.0% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in November and December.</span>

                    <span>Uncertainty can have an important impact on economic activity, but it is not directly observable. This column presents the features of the European Commission’s new index for uncertainty in the economy, based on its EU-wide Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys, and its evolution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the stringency of the related restrictions. It also compares the indicator to survey-based indicators of economic confidence, as well as to other existing uncertainty gauges, and offers a glimpse of the rich set of geographical, sectoral, and sub-sectoral breakdowns of the new data.</span>

                    <span>Monetary policy issues are discussed on social media by experts and also increasingly by non-experts, presenting a challenge to central banks using social media to communicate with their target audiences. This column analyses ECB-related tweets and finds that more subjective views and tweets expressed in stronger language are more likely to get retweeted, thereby shaping the tone of the virtual discussions. Both experts and non-experts are responsive to ECB communication – in most cases, information is simply relayed on Twitter, but there are also instances of controversial discussions being triggered.</span>

• Schedule for Week of November 28, 2021
Monday:
• At 10:00 AM ET, Pending Home Sales Index for October.  The consensus is for a 1.0% increase in the index.
• At 10:30 AM, Dallas Fed Survey of Manufacturing Activity for November.  This is the last of the regional Fed manufacturing surveys for November.
   From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 futures are up 31 and DOW futures are up 180 (fair value).
Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $70.30 per barrel and Brent at $74.67 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $46, and Brent was at $47 - so WTI oil prices are up 50% year-over-year. 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.38 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.11 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.27 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>From the Philly Fed: 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has released the coincident indexes for the 50 states for October 2021. Over the  past three months, the indexes increased in 49 states and decreased in one state, for a three-month diffusion index of 96.  Additionally, in the past month, the indexes increased in 48 states and decreased in two states, for a one-month diffusion  index of 92. For comparison purposes, the Philadelphia Fed has also developed a similar coincident index for the entire  United States. The Philadelphia Fed’s U.S. index increased 1.4 percent over the past three months and 0.4 percent in  October.
emphasis added
Note: These are coincident indexes constructed from state employment data.  An explanation from the Philly Fed: 
The coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state’s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state’s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.

The map is almost all positive on a three-month basis.

And here is a graph is of the number of states with one month increasing activity according to the Philly Fed. 

This graph includes states with minor increases (the Philly Fed lists as unchanged).
In October, 48 states had increasing activity including minor increases.</span>

                    <span>There is disagreement over whether the current inflation is here to stay. This column argues that sticky-price inflation, which focuses on components of the consumer price index with infrequent price changes, is particularly useful at the moment as it can help control for ongoing changes in the relative prices of goods and provides hints about future CPI inflation. In October 2021, monthly sticky-price inflation, partially corrected for base effects, was 5.3%. In turn, the CPI inflation forecast for October 2022 is 5.6% and highly uncertain.</span>

                    <span>Note: Back in early 2016, I noted that energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE had hit an all-time low. Here is an update through the recently released October PCE report.
Below is a graph of expenditures on energy goods and services as a percent of total personal consumption expenditures through October 2021.
This is one of the measures that Professor Hamilton at Econbrowser looks at to evaluate any drag on GDP from energy prices.

Data source: BEA.
The huge spikes in energy prices during the oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 are obvious.  As is the increase in energy prices during the 2001 through 2008 period. 
In general, energy expenditures as a percent of PCE have been trending down for years.
At the beginning of the pandemic, energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE, fell to a record low of 3.3% in May 2020.


In October 2021,  energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE had rebounded and were at 4.1% of PCE.  This is slightly above the pre-pandemic level in early 2020.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Four House Price Topics
Brief excerpt: 
Even though the September index will show another very strong YoY gain, I expect house price growth to decelerate in coming months.  
...
The following graph shows YoY price changes for the NAR median house prices, Case-Shiller National price index, and the FHFA purchase-only index (Fannie and Freddie loans only). 
Most of the time, the NAR median price leads the Case-Shiller index, and I expect the Case-Shiller index to show a lower growth rate (but still robust) in coming months. 
...
In the October existing home sales report released last week, the NAR reported months-of-supply was unchanged at 2.4 months in October. There is a seasonal pattern to inventory, but this is still very low - and prices will remain solid as long as inventories stay low.

                    <span>These forecasts are prior to the news on the B.1.1.529 variant: Heavily mutated coronavirus variant puts scientists on alert
Goldman Sachs also put out a note prior to the variant news: 
“We now expect the Fed to announce at its December meeting that it is doubling the pace of tapering to $30bn per month starting in January. ... While this faster pace of tapering would allow the FOMC to consider a rate hike as early as March, our best guess is that it will wait until June, when a few additional employment reports will be available. We now expect hikes in June, September, and December …”
From BofA: 
4Q GDP tracking remains at 6.0% qoq saar, supported by the strong data this week. [November 24 estimate]
emphasis added
From Goldman Sachs
We boosted our Q4 GDP tracking estimate by 1pt to +6.0% (qoq ar). This change embeds larger expected contributions from inventories and goods exports, and it also reflects the strong Q3 pace of gross domestic income (+6.7% annualized). [November 24 estimate]
And from the Altanta Fed: GDPNow
The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the fourth quarter of 2021 is 8.6 percent on November 24, up from 8.2 percent on November 17.  [November 24 estimate]</span>

협동조합기본법 시행 10년, ‘협동조합 2만 개 시대’를 맞아 지나온 역사와 현실 상황을 살피고, 한국의 협동조합은 무엇을 해야 할지 모색하며 새로운 대안으로 ‘협동조합 허브론’을 제시한다.

협동조합 운동의 본질은 협동하려는 인간에 대한 신뢰를 바탕으로 자유롭고 평등한 사회를 만들겠다는 인류의 꿈을 실현하는 것이다. 그러나 갈수록 심해지는 불평등과 인류의 존재 자체를 위협하는 기후 위기 앞에서 그 꿈은 닿을 수 없는 이상에 불과한 것 아닌가 하는 회의의 정서가 짙다. 

책은 그런 참혹한 현실을 직시하면서, 그럼에도 불구하고 협동조합만이 할 수 있는 영역이 분명히 있음을 확인한다. 그것은 협동조합이 작은 협동의 경험들을 이어 큰 협동으로 나아가는 접착제 역할을 하고 사회 곳곳을 협동으로 연결하는 허브가 되는 것이다.

김기태, 강민수 두 저자는 한국 협동조합 운동의 산증인으로, 현장은 물론 협동조합 연구 분야에서도 혁혁한 성과를 보여 주었다. 이제 협동조합 허브론이라는 새로운 운동론을 제안하며 40년 전 레이들로가 ICA(국제협동조합연맹) 모스크바 대회에서 제기한 협동조합의 정체성에서 한 걸음 더 나아갈 것을 촉구한다.

북한과 인접한 해안가에는 파도에 떠밀려 온 북한 생활 쓰레기가 가득하다. 이 지역에서 수거한 북한 생활 쓰레기 제품 포장지는 모두 708종의 1,414점이다. 당과류와 음료류는 물론 식품류와 잡화류 그리고 의약품까지 실로 그 종류가 엄청나다. 

자력갱생을 강조하는 북한에서 어떻게 이리도 다양한 상품을 만들어 내는지 그저 의아할 뿐이었다. 그렇게 하나둘 모은 생활 쓰레기는 북한 사회를 읽는 소중한 자료이자 보물이 되었다. 생활쓰레기 포장지는 북한 제품의 브랜드와 디자인, 생산공장 현황 그리고 정치선전을 엿볼 수 있다. 북한사람들의 흔적이 고스란히 담긴 서해안의 으로 함께 떠나보자.

                    <span>앞으로 100년 인류의 미래를 위한 100장의 지도
이언 골딘 외 지음, 권태형 외 옮김 / 동아시아 / 2021년 11월 / ISBN:9788962624045

옥스퍼드 마틴 스쿨의 창립자이자 세계화 및 국제 개발 분야의 권위자인 이언 골딘과 정치학, 안보학 분야의 석학인 이가라페 연구소의 로버트 머가가 함께 쓴 책이다. 수십 년 간 축적된 연구 및 데이터에 최신의 위성 사진 및 지도 자료를 결합시켰다. 세계화, 기후, 도시화, 불공정, 폭력, 보건, 인구…, 인류가 맞이하고 있는 열네 가지의 중대한 국면을 낱낱이 분석하고 각 현안들을 명쾌한 이미지로 시각화하여 보여준다.

19세기 광고계의 거물이었던 프레드 버나드는 “한 장의 이미지가 천 마디의 말보다 낫다”라는 말을 남겼다. 그 말처럼, 『앞으로 100년』에서 이언 골딘과 로버트 머가가 전하는 메시지는 구체화된 이미지를 통해 사람들에게 가닿는다. 인류가 지구에 어떤 영향을 미치고 있을까? 지금 인류가 지구 위에서 지속 가능한 삶을 꾸려가려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 북극에서 일어나는 화재, 전 세계에서 동시다발적으로 일어나는 해수면의 상승, 이민자에 대한 사람들의 편견과 그 이면의 진실…. 

이 모두를 단순한 말이 아니라 구체적인 이미지로 전달한다. 다양한 방식으로 제작된 100장을 훌쩍 넘어서는 지도와 인포그래픽은 압축적이면서도 설명적이다. 저자들은 때로는 우리의 직관에 어긋나기도 하는 세계의 단면을 냉철하게 제시한다. 그러면서도 그 목소리에는 호소력이 있다. 왜냐면 그들에게는 인류가 맞이한 문제와 앞으로 나아가야 할 방향에 대한 명확한 비전이 있기 때문이다.

저자들이 제시하는 것은 이 지구 위에서 인류가 살아남고, 지속 가능한 삶을 살기 위한 거대한 로드맵이다. 이 책은 인류가 미지의 땅을 헤쳐나가기 위해 집어들어야 할 필수적인 생존 가이드북이다.

경제학박사 정인호 교수의 책. 이 책은 블록체인의 진정한 장점이 무엇인지, 그것이 어떻게 확장될 수 있는지, 그리고 그 결과 얼마나 광범위하고 심원한 변화가 우리 생활에서 나타날 것인지를 친절하게 설명하고 있다. 저자는 조개에서 시작한 돈의 진화가, 모바일과 블록체인을 통해 혁명적으로 변화하는 과정을 보여준다. 그리고 그것을 통해 금융의 미래를 어떻게 짜야 하는지 방향을 제시한다.

                    <span>The competitive impacts of vertical mergers are a long-standing question in antitrust economics. A recent wave of vertical mergers has reinvigorated the academic and policy debate on enforcement, and the discussion is far from settled. An example of this is that US antitrust authorities presented new vertical merger guidelines in 2020, but the Federal Trade […]

                    <span>First, thanks to all the healthcare workers and first responders who have been - and still are - on the front lines saving lives. Thank you!
Here are five economic reasons to be thankful this Thanksgiving. (Hat Tip to Neil Irwin who started doing this several years ago)
1) A Falling Unemployment Rate.
The unemployment rate was at 4.6% in October.  The unemployment rate is down from 14.8% in April 2020 (the highest since the Great Depression).
The unemployment rate is down from 6.9% a year ago (October 2019). 

There are still 4.3 million fewer jobs than in February 2020, but this is significant improvement in the unemployment rate.
2) Falling unemployment claims.
This graph shows the 4-week moving average of weekly claims since 1971.


Weekly claims declined to 199,000 last week, the lowes…</span>

모바일과 인터넷을 삶에서 결코 떼어낼 수 없는 젊은 세대이든, 종이 신문이 오히려 익숙한 ‘올드 제너레이션’이든, 하루도 빠짐없이 맞닥뜨리게 되는 언어들이 있다. 많은 이들이 그저 고개를 갸우뚱할 뿐 또렷하게 이해하지 못 하는, 그렇다고 딱히 물어볼 데도 없고 네이버로 검색을 해봐도 속 시원하게 개념이 정리되지도 않아 어정쩡한 채로 머릿속을 맴도는, 저 숱한 경제용어들이 바로 그 언어다. 싹 무시해버릴 수도 없고 그렇다고 들러붙어 공부하기도 쉽지 않은 이 용어들은 대체로 몇 개의 타입으로 나뉜다. 

이해하기 난감한 최신 경제용어 160개를 선정해 제목처럼 ‘명쾌하고 야무지게’ 해설한 책을 독자들에게 제시한다. 단순한 개념 정의는 말할 것도 없거니와, 그 용어가 생겨난 배경이나 경제 환경, 그 용어가 우리의 일상생활, 직장생활, 그리고 투자 활동에 미치게 될 영향이나 충격, 해설을 한층 더 생생하게 만들어주는 실제 기업이나 인물들의 사례, 좀 더 수월한 이해를 도와줄 이미지와 도표와 차트 및 통계치, 향후 경제의 흐름을 어느 정도 예측할 수 있게 도와주는 전문가들의 조언에 이르기까지. 

이 책 한 권이면 골치 아팠던 핵심 경제용어들이 또렷이 이해되어 친하게 다가올 뿐 아니라, 마지막 장을 덮을 때쯤이면 누구나 ‘나름 경제전문가’의 경지에 이를 수 있을 것이다. 물론 현명하고 민첩한 재테크 기술의 습득은 짜릿한 보너스다.

중앙일보 경제부 기자들과 함께 ‘금융 SOS’를 연재하고 있는 경제 기자가 쓴 책이다. 누구나 한 번쯤은 가족간 돈거래, 부동산, 빚, 기타 금융사고 등으로 인해 어려움을 겪는다. 하지만 금융 관련 직종 종사자나 전공자가 아니고서야 인터넷을 구석구석 뒤진다 해도 해결책을 찾기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니다. 

이 책은 그런 어려움을 겪는 이들에게 상비약이 되어줄 유용한 경제지침서이다. 저자는 흔히 벌어지는 각종 금융 사건·사고의 다양한 실제 사례를 직접 취재하고, 변호사와 금융 전문가들의 자문을 받아 그에 대한 ‘해결책’을 찾는 데 초점을 맞추었다.

일반 독자들에게 단순히 ‘어떻게 하면 돈을 잘 모을 수 있는지’와 같은 경제와 금융 관련 정보를 전달하는 데 그치는 것이 아니라, 금융에 대해 잘 알지 못하는 일반 사람들, 특히 금융 사각지대에 놓인 이들에게 실질적인 도움을 주기 위해 쓰였다. 개인 혼자 해결하기 어려운 금융문제의 대처법을 일목요연하게 정리했다.

지은이의 말_일상 속 ‘돈’ 문제로 힘들 때 가정 상비약이 되어줄게요

1장 가족간 돈 거래는 남보다 더 ‘깐깐하게’
부모에게 돈을 빌렸다면 ‘연 4.6% 이자’를 납부해야
“고생했어. 이 집은 당신 줄게” 남편의 말로 한 증여, 통할까? 
“며느리야, 이혼하면 상가는 안 준다” 이혼계약서 쓰는 부자들
“집 줄게, 효도해라” 효도도 계약서 쓰는 시대 
형제간 재산싸움을 막으려면 부모의 유언장이 필수
떠난 딸 몫을 원하는 사위, 한푼도 주기 싫은 장인의 방어책은? 
7배 폭등한 남편의 비트코인, 이혼 때 남편이 “산 적 없다” 잡아떼면?
현금자산이 10억을 넘으면 ‘육십분’ 전략을 쓰자
평생 일군 회사, ‘가업’ 승계도 전략이 필요하다

2장 돈 쓰는 지혜를 알아야 돈이 모인다
피트니스센터 이용권 결제 시 먹튀에 대비해 영수증을 챙기자
통신사·신용카드 포인트를 1원도 허투루 버리지 않는 법
코로나19와 아시아나 M&amp;A, ‘내 마일리지’는 어쩌죠?
‘앗, 택시에 서류가방을’ 신용카드로 분실물 찾는 방법은?
주차장 붙박이 운전자와 초보 운전자를 위한 자동차보험은?
1년에 한두 번 병원 찾는데 4세대 실손보험으로 갈아탈까?
자녀 학비 마련 위해 예금 대신 삼성전자 주식 사준다
불황에 더 빛나는 예물 재테크, 순금 목걸이와 팔찌 세트 어때요?
13월의 월급을 챙기는 연말정산 4가지 전략

3장 내 인생의 최대 숙제인 ‘집’
전세계약이 2년 더 연장될까? 만약 집주인이 거주하겠다고 하면?
전세 낀 집을 살 때는 ‘세입자 계약 만료 시점’을 꼭 확인해야
육아문제로 부모와 집을 합치면 1주택자 비과세 혜택을 못 받나?
20대 자녀 명의로 집을 샀다면 1주택자로 취득세를 내야 할까?
개인회생을 신청해도 주택 압류를 막을 수 있다 
형제가 집을 ‘반반’씩 사이좋게 상속받으면 세금폭탄 
절세 알아보다가 이혼, 갈라서면 정말 세금 줄어들까? 
신혼부부 특공과 생애 최초 특공 중 무주택 신혼부부에게 유리한 것은? 
부부 공동명의인 아파트 한 채 은퇴자, 단독명의로 바꿔야 할까?

4장 ‘빚’의 굴레에서 벗어나 ‘빛’ 보는 법
내가 상속포기를 하면, 내 자식이 그 빚을 물려받는다

국내외 최초로 롱텀 디플레이션(LTD)을 본격 연구한 책이다. 디플레이션을 통상의 불경기인 숏텀 디플레이션과 롱텀 디플레이션으로 나눠서 설명하고 아무도 모르는 투자비법을 최초로 공개한다. 모든 재산들은 서로 관계가 있다는 사실을 FRED의 40~50년간의 같은 연월일의 데이터 즉 달러 환율과 주가지수, 주택지수, 금과 원유 등의 관계를 명쾌하게 설명한다.

Low inventories and supply issues continue to impacting vehicle sales, but sales are bouncing back.
Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows actual sales from the BEA (Blue), and Wards forecast for November (Red).
The Wards forecast of 13.6 million SAAR, would be up about 4.7% from last month, and down 14% from a year ago (sales were solid in November 2020, as sales recovered from the depths of the pandemic).

Wards also expects sales to increase further in December.   It appears the supply chain disruption bottom is in.</span>

부동산문제를 해결하려면, 성경 희년법과 포도원 천국 비유의 시장원리대로 토지사용자가 세貰(토지임료)를 내는 지대시장제와 토지주식제를 해야 한다. 지대시장제는 “반값으로 내 땅, 내 집”, 세금까지 사라진다. 지대시장제는 100% 사유재산제와 시장자유가 보장되는 경제원리이다.

머리말
‘40일 토지 정탐’과 ‘40년 토지 실험’
사람에게 한 가지 더 부족한 것

일러두기

제1편
땅과 사람

제1장 가족의 기업과 부동산시장의 수수께끼
기업 무르기 이야기 / 부동산시장의 수수께끼 / 790만 원이 1억 원으로 / 사상 초유 ‘1억 원 내기토론’ 성사될까? / ‘1억 원 내기’는 아직도 유효합니다
제2장 땅값의 발견과 토지 예찬
[복숭아와 복숭아씨] &#x3D; [토지임료와 땅값] / 토지 예찬 / 만나와 오병이어 / 만나와 오병이어보다 더 큰 기적은 / 인간사人間史와 지구사地球史―사람이 경제적 땅(지구)을 보지 못한 혼돈의 세상사 / 땅값은 지구가격, 사람에게는 너무 크고 길어서… / 바닷물도 사용으로 줄일 수 없습니다 / 쓸 수 있는 상품가격과 쓸 수 없는 땅값
제3장 토지 무르기에서 찾아내는 인간 구원
구원이란? / 원죄原罪와 원빚原負債 / 몸값과 땅값은 빚 중의 빚입니다―땅값은 원빚原負債입니다 / 죄들은 사해지고, 빚들은 없애 버려야 합니다
부동산문제의 근본적 원인과 해법을 찾는 과학적 설명회 요청
처음에 / 땅값 이해를 위한 질문 / 땅값의 성질과 부동산문제의 근본 해법을 찾기 위한 설명회 요청

제2편
희년법의 재발견―속량의 원천·자유의 뿌리

제4장 성경의 희년법으로 들어가면서
레위기의 구조와 성경 희년법 / 희년법은 사유재산제와 시장경제의 원리입니다 / 희년법은 경제학이 풀어야 했습니다 / 성경 희년법은 시장경제의 신호등입니다
제5장 본문으로 소개하는 성경 희년법(토지 속량법)
안식년―땅은 사람처럼 일하고 쉬며, 사람이 없어도 스스로 산물을 내고 있다 / 희년―토지 무르기로 땅값(원빚)이 사라져서, 토지가 돌아오면, 백성들은 자유를 누린다 / 성경이 허용한 토지거래법 / 성경이 금지한 토지거래법 / 토지 무르기―토지 속량법, 무르기가 완성되면 자유가 최고로 보장되는 희년이 온다
제6장 레위기 희년법의 경제적 접근과 이해
땅에 대한 인간 오해―땅을 상품으로 보는 것은 인간의 과학적 오류 / 성경 토지법: 땅은 스스로 생산한다 / 성경 토지법: 토지는 생산될 열매의 연수를 따라 팔고 사라 / 성경 토지법: 토지는 영원히 팔리지 말라 / 성경 토지법: 토지를 시한부로 팔았으면(세를 놓았으면) 무르기를 하라 / 토지거래와 무...

대중에게 건설업은 어떤 이미지로 각인되고 있을까? 건설산업은 한국 경제 발전의 핵심 토대를 이루며, 성장을 견인하는 역할을 충실히 해왔다. 특히 1950년대 한국전쟁으로 폐허가 된 우리나라는 각종 기반시설의 구축, 주택 등을 비롯한 수많은 건축물의 건설을 통해 양적, 질적 성과를 이룩했다. 우리나라를 지금의 선진국 반열에 올려놓은 원동력의 중심에는 과거 건설산업이 있었다.

하지만 건설산업은 낮은 생산성과 수익성, 그리고 시대의 변화에 따르지 못하는 업계 관행 등으로 점차 국가 산업에서 점점 경쟁력을 잃어갔다. 특히 3D업종, 부실공사, 부정부패, 환경파괴, 담합, 폭리 등 일반 대중이 생각하는 건설업에 대한 부정적인 이미지는 건설산업이 성장하고 미래를 설계하는 데에 큰 걸림돌이 되고 있다. 건설업에 대한 부정적 이미지는 그저 인식으로만 그치는 것이 아니라, 산업현장에서는 일자리 기피 현상으로도 나타나고 있다.

《이코노컨스트럭션》의 저자는 우리나라 건설업이 걸어온 발자취를 들여다보며, 한국 경제에서 건설산업이 얼마나 큰 비중을 차지하고 또 국가 경제에 얼마만큼의 기여를 했는지 자세히 설명해준다. 전성기 건설업의 모습만을 조명하는 것은 아니다. 건설업이 경쟁력을 잃었던 원인 그리고 건설업의 어두운 면을 살펴봄으로써, 국가 경제의 큰 비중을 차지하는 건설업의 현재를 진단하고 더 나은 내일을 준비할 수 있도록 독려한다. [more...]

저소득층의 고통은 한층 커졌으며 집값은 천정부지로 뛰어 내 집 마련은 아무나 꿀 수 없는 꿈이 되고 말았다. 이렇게 무너진 한국경제를 다시 일으켜 세워야 하는 것은, 2022년 출범하는 새 정부의 숙명적 과제일 것이다. 이를 위해 국내 최고 경제정책 전문가 10인이 모여 ‘성장과 혁신’, ‘재정과 복지’, ‘부동산·금융·공정거래’, ‘노동, 저출산’ 등 9개의 어젠다를 제시한다. 

이 책에서는 정부가 추진해온 ‘소득주도성장론’과 ‘집값 안정 정책’은 실패했다고 분석하며, 경제의 기본 원리를 다시 복원해야 한다고 말한다. 저성장 극복 방안, 디지털시대의 혁신역량 강화, 국가 재정전략 수립, 주택시장 정상화 해법, 금융 산업과 서비스업의 경쟁력 제고, 초저출산 사회의 과제 등 한국경제를 정상궤도로 돌려놓기 위한 혁신전략을 담은 이 책은 대한민국의 경제 발전을 위한 가장 믿음직스러운 정책서가 되어줄 것이다.

급격한 기후변화와 코로나19로 인한 전 세계적 경제 충격으로 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 친환경적 움직임이 가속되고 있다. 전 세계 주요국은 친환경차 보급 확대를 지원하고 있으며, 이를 위한 인프라 구축에 많은 돈을 쏟아붓고 있다. 

자동차 산업과 직결되는 재생 에너지는 호시탐탐 기회를 엿보던 몇몇 국가의 새로운 성장 동력이 된 지 오래다. 또한 한국뿐 아니라 많은 나라에서 그린 뉴딜 정책으로 일자리를 창출해 코로나19로 인한 경제 침체를 극복하고자 한다. 즉 우리는 이러한 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 역학 관계에 주목할 필요가 있다.

대격변의 시대, 두 산업에서 투자자의 시선은 어디로 향할 것인가? 현대차증권의 장문수, 강동진 연구위원은 전 세계를 뒤바꿔놓을 거대한 흐름을 다각도로 분석한다. 주요국의 친환경차 관련 주요 정책 및 코로나19로 인한 경영 환경의 변화는 물론, 테슬라·도요타·폭스바겐 등 글로벌 모빌리티 기업의 친환경 대응 전략과 재생 에너지 기술의 핵심 역량을 조망한다. 이 책을 통해 에너지와 모빌리티 산업의 변화상을 들여다본다면 위기 속에서 새로운 기회를 잡을 수 있을 것이다.

‘부조리’, ‘불공정’, ‘불투명’에 맞서 싸우는 경제 전문가이자, 한국 경제 ‘팩트 저격수’로 잘 알려진 최배근 건국대 교수의 최신간. 그는 이 책에서 개혁 정부의 실패를 바라는 부패세력이 어떻게 경제적 사실을 왜곡하고, 부정적 여론으로 확산시키는지 풍부한 데이터를 통해 흥미롭게 분석한다. 

특히 ‘언론-포털-경제관료-야당’으로 이어지는 부패 기득권 카르텔에 주목하며, 그들이 어떻게 한국 경제를 ‘사익 추구’의 방편으로 활용하고 있는지 낱낱이 파헤친다. 모피아를 중심으로 한 경제관료들이 문재인 정부에서 ‘재정 안정’이라는 명목으로 소득주도성장, 부동산 세제 개편, 전 국민 재난지원금 지급 등의 개혁 정책에 맞서 ‘태업한’ 적나라한 증거들을 공개한다.

Prologue_ ‘그들’을 막지 못하면 대한민국의 진전은 없다 

I부. 경제 ‘지표’를 부정하는 사람들
 ― 문재인 정부 경제정책의 팩트

1. ‘나라를 거덜 낸 정권’은 어떻게 시작했나 _이명박, 박근혜의 유산
2. 문재인 정부는 무조건 옳지 않다?! _개혁 정부의 손발 묶기
3. 보수언론이 원하는 재정 투입은 따로 있다 _‘재정지출’을 막는 진짜 속내
4. 왜 ‘소득주도성장’은 멈춰 섰을까 _‘어공’의 미흡한 준비, ‘늘공’의 완강한 저항
__팩트 파인더: 소득주도성장은 계속돼야 한다
5. 2020년 부동산 폭등, 이미 예견된 것이다 _모피아와 언론의 합작품
6. 보수언론이 원하는 세상은 ‘모두가 좋은 세상’이 아니다 _사익을 취하는 자들
7. 절대로 일본을 이길 수 없다는 믿음 _아베의 경제침략을 이겨낸 이유
8. GDP 증가율 세계 1위에 담긴 진실 _K-방역과 K-민주주의

II부. K-방역이 실패해야 하는 사람들
 ― 경제 효과 너머의 가치 

1. 누가 K-방역을 흔드는가 _부패세력의 생존 방정식
2. “한국은 이미 선진국이다” _K-방역이 가져온 기저효과
3. 그들이 ‘전 국민’ 재난지원금을 막으려는 이유 _선별복지라는 위선
4. 방역과 경제 2마리의 토끼를 잡아야 한다 _새로운 경제 생태계
5. K-브랜드, K-민주주의의 기회가 되다 _우리가 만든 ‘문법’

III부. ‘부동산 폭등’을 즐기는 사람들
 ― 폭등 뒤에 숨은 검은 배후

1. ‘LH 사태’가 말해주는 것 _부패의 기원 
__팩트 파인더: 반칙과 특권에 기생하는 부동산-금융 카르텔
2. 문재인 정부 부동산 정책 실패의 기원 _예고된 신뢰 추락
3. 왜 민주 정부의 부동산 정책은 항상 실패하는가 _부동산 카르텔의 힘 

IV부. ‘재정안정주의’의 그늘에 숨은 사람들
 ― ‘모피아’ 관료들이 살아가는 방식 

1. ‘혁명의 언어’가 된 전 국민 재난지원금 _‘88%’의 비밀
2. 모피아가 재정지출에 반대하는 이유 _재정 사유화
__팩트 파인더: ‘나랏돈’이 쌓인다는데, 무엇이 문제일까?
3. 제2의 윤석열, 최재형은 계속된다 _언론, 검찰, 모피아
4. 경제관료 못 잡으면 ‘K-민주주의’ 없다 _‘늘공’ 통제 시스템
__팩트 파...

지금까지 사람들은 직장과 가족 등에서 안정감을 얻고 유대를 획득해왔다. 그러나 이제 직업은 표준과 안정이 아닌 불안정의 상징이다. 삶은 유동성에 지배되고 있다. 이에 순응하듯 긱잡, 프리터, N잡러 같은 저고용 방식들이 확산되고 있다. 결혼과 가족 또한 안전판으로서의 제도가 아닌 예측 불가능한 사건이 되었다. 그렇다면 현대인들은 이런 전통적인 공동체 대신 무엇으로부터 정체성의 위기를 해소하고 안정감과 유대감을 찾고 있을까? 바로 취향이다. 회사 회식은 싫지만 취향 모임에는 기꺼이 참석하며, 가족과 함께 TV를 보는 대신 SNS와 게임 친구들과 소통한다. 

도서출판 따비의 신간 《취향의 경제―취향의 시대는 산업과 소비를 어떻게 바꾸는가》는 취향을 추구하는 개인들이 경제와 산업을 어떻게 바꾸어냈는지를 논증하며, 취향의 추구가 불평등과 혐오를 완화하는 방향으로 나아가려면 무엇이 필요한지 모색한다.

우리 시대가 직면한 긴박한 문제들―이민, 세계화, 자동화와 실업, 경제 성장과 불평등, 기후변화, 정부의 역할 등―을 해결하려면 경제학이 필요하다. 하지만 경제학은 지금까지는 너무나 경직적인 이상의 세계에서 이론적 모델과 같은 대안만 내놓았다. 저자들은 마치 저 높은 하늘에만 떠 있던 경제학을 우리가 살고 있는 땅, 즉 현실로 끌고 내려와 실증 근거들을 기반으로 우리 사회의 큰 문제들을 실제로 해결하기 위한 방법을 파고든다. 

노벨상 수상 경제학자 배너지와 뒤플로는 경제학이 제대로만 수행된다면 (그러니까 ‘좋은 경제학’이) 우리 시대의 가장 첨예한 사회적, 정치적 난제들을 해결하는 데 일조할 수 있다고 말한다. 이주 문제부터 불평등까지, 성장의 둔화부터 기후변화의 가속화까지, 우리는 거대한 어려움에 직면해 있다. 하지만 그 어려움을 헤쳐 나갈 수 있는 자원과 역량이 없는 것도 아니다.

이 책은 우리에게 이런 문제들을 해결할 새로운 관점을 독창적이고 도발적이며 시의적절하게 제시한다. 저자들의 깊은 통찰을 통해, 아슬아슬한 균형 위에 서 있는 우리 세계의 문제점과 역량 모두를 더 올바르게 이해할 수 있게 될 것이다.

초등 사회 교과에 등장하는 경제 개념 24개를 한 컷의 그림으로 표현해 어른은 물론 아이도 이해하기 쉽게 표현한다. 그리고 그 24개의 개념을 확장하여 부모와 아이가 함께 돈에 대해 생각하고 이야기 나눠본 뒤 실천할 수 있는 재테크 활동 팁을 ‘돈 레시피’ 형태로 제공한다.

저자는 이 책을 통해 어른과 아이 스스로 “살면서 얼마만큼의 돈이 있으면 부자인가?”에 대한 기준을 세우라고 강조한다. 그 기준이 있어야 그에 필요한 재테크 활동과 투자 금액을 설정할 수 있고, 스스로의 기준이 있으면 타인과의 비교로 불행해하거나 돈 자체를 숭배하지 않을 수 있기 때문이다.

머리말

Part1 부자가 아니어도 돈은 가르칠 수 있다

1장 아이에게 돈을 가르쳐야 하는 이유

대한민국은 그동안 크게 성장했다. 하지만 성장의 후유증 또한 크다. 국가 성공을 위해 희생했던 개인의 때늦은 보상의 욕구가 분출하고 있다. 자유민주주의에서 자유의 시장경쟁 원칙이 무너지고 민주의 법치주의가 위협받고 있다. 

외교와 안보에서도 극심한 분열과 혼란을 보이고 있다. 여기에 경제는 계속해서 추락하고 사람들의 좌절과 분노 그리고 갈등은 좀처럼 진정될 기미가 보이지 않고 있다. 국민적 에너지인 역동성마저 저하되고 있다.

방향은 목표이고 길은 그곳에 이르는 과정이다. 2022년 대선을 향한 경쟁의 총성이 울린 현재, 심학봉 전 의원은 국가가 당면한 이러한 문제들의 올바른 방향성을 재설정하고, 국가가 나아갈 새로운 길을 제안한다.

서문
제1부 성공에 취해 그림자를 놓치다
1. 한국에 발을 들인 리바이어던 / 2. 그 시절, 국가들이 힘을 키운 방법 / 3. 회색코뿔소가 우리에게로 온다 / 4. 줄 서지 말고 손잡고 걸어가자! / 5. 해가 저무는 국가들의 모습

제2부 대한민국은 힘이 세다! 우리가 할 수 있는 것
1. 더 이상 아이 울음소리가 들리지 않는다 /  2. 우리 모두 평등하다는 진리를 잊지 않기 /
3. 시대가 변했다 좋은 일자리도 변했다 /  4. 새로운 대한민국의 시작? 교육혁신부터! 
 
제3부 천천히 오래도록 함께 가자
1. 지속가능한 사회, 아름다운 미래의 길 / 2. 다시 만드는 대한민국 ‘우리’공동체 / 3. 대한민국 경제의 중심, 중산층을 살려라 / 4. 강한 국가는 무엇을 가지고 있을까? / 5. 뿌리 깊은 국가정신을 만들자 / 6. 정치적 편향! 이제는 정말 끝내야 해! 

제4부 원 팀이 되면 못 할 것이 없다
1. 모든 국민이 깨어 있는 그날까지 / 2. 국민과 국가가 함께 걷는 평화의 길 / 3. 국민의 행동력이 나라를 움직인다

                    <span>Last summer’s mass mobilization for racial justice sparked debates around how to combat entrenched racial inequality in the United States. Recent corporate diversity initiatives, while a step in the right direction, are not sufficient to topple structural racism in the economy. One of the most striking dimensions of inequality in the United States is the […]

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

이 책의 예제 코드와 함께 홈페이지 회원들에게만 제공하는 회원특전 PDF는 예제와 라이브러리 사용법 간이 매뉴얼로 성안당 홈페이지(www.cyber.co.kr) [도서몰]에 회원가입 후 [자료실]-[자료실] 바로가기에서 도서 검색을 통해 다운로드할 수 있다.
