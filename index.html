                    <span>Government transfer payments decreased in May compared to April, but were still almost $1.0 trillion (on SAAR basis) above the February 2020 level (pre-pandemic)  Note: Seasonal adjustment doesn&#x27;t make sense with one time payments, but that is how the data is presented.  

Most of the increase in transfer payments - compared to the levels prior to the crisis - is from unemployment insurance and &quot;other&quot; (includes direct payments).  
This table shows the amount of unemployment insurance and &quot;Other&quot; transfer payments since February 2020 (pre-crisis level).  The increase in &quot;Other&quot; was mostly due to parts of the relief acts including direct payments.

There was a large increase in &quot;Other&quot; in March due to the American Rescue Plan Act.


Note: Not in the table below, but Social Security payments haven&#x27;t increased significantly since the pre-recession levels (from $1,065 billion SAAR in Jan 2020 to $1,111 billion SAAR in May 2021).

A key measure of the health of the economy (Used by NBER in recession dating) is Real Personal Income less Transfer payments.
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows real personal income less transfer payments since 1990.
This measure of economic activity increased 0.4% in May, compared to April, and was up 0.8% compared to February 2020 (previous peak).
This is the first of the key NBER measures - GDP, Employment, Industrial Production, Real Personal Income less Transfer Payments - that is above pre-recession levels.  GDP will be above pre-recession levels in Q2.</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of June 22nd.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Common, Marginal, Mid-Month Increase of Number of Forbearance Plans This Week
In what’s become a common trend of marginal mid-month increases, the number of active forbearance plans ticked up slightly from last week.
According to the weekly snapshot of Black Knight’s McDash Flash daily loan-level performance dataset, 2.06 million homeowners – representing 3.9% of mortgaged properties – remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans.
  
While the total number of plans rose by 1,000 since last Tuesday, the population is still down 6% from the same time last month. That’s as compared to last week’s 5.4% monthly rate of improvement.
  
A 10,000 decline in the number of active GSE forbearance plans and a 7,000 drop in FHA/VA plans were both more than offset by a rise of 18,000 among portfolio and privately held mortgages.

Meanwhile, starts edged lower this week and were 7% below their previous 4-week average. Likewise, removals hit their lowest level in five weeks and extension activity was down as well.
That said, more than 300K plans are still scheduled for quarterly reviews between now and next Wednesday, which could lead to more exits. We should all be expecting more activity one way or another as we near the 4th of July.

                    <span>The BEA released the Personal Income and Outlays report for May: 
Personal income decreased $414.3 billion (2.0 percent) in May according to estimates released today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Disposable personal income (DPI) decreased $436.3 billion (2.3 percent) and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $2.9 billion (less than 0.1 percent).
Real DPI decreased 2.8 percent in May and Real PCE decreased 0.4 percent; goods decreased 2.0 percent and services increased 0.4 percent. The PCE price index increased 0.4 percent. Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index increased 0.5 percent.
 emphasis added
The May PCE price index increased 3.9 percent year-over-year and the May PCE price index, excluding food and energy, increased 3.4 percent year-over-year.
The following graph shows real Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) through May 2021 (2012 dollars). Note that the y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the change.
 Click on graph for larger image.
The dashed red lines are the quarterly levels for real PCE.
Personal income was above expectations,  and the increase in PCE was below expectations.
Using the two-month method to estimate Q2 PCE growth, PCE was increasing at a 16.2% annual rate in Q2 2021. (using the mid-month method, PCE was  increasing at 18.2%). However, this reflects the impact of the American Rescue Plan in April and May, and overall Q2 growth will be lower than those estimates.</span>

                    <span>The rise in income inequality and, more prominently, in the wage gap between men and women has been one of the major concerns among policymakers and the public in recent years. This column presents new evidence from Germany on the impact of exports on the gender wage gap which shows that an increase in a plant’s exports significantly reduces the wage gap between male and female co-workers in white-collar occupations, but widens it for employees in blue-collar occupations. The findings suggest that designing policies that support women taking part in trade, especially in positions in which they would benefit from their comparative advantage, is crucial to maximise the potential benefits from globalisation.</span>

Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.19%, down from 0.20% in April, and up more than double from 0.09% in May 2020.</span>

                    <span>As part of the new home sales report released yesterday, the Census Bureau reported the number of homes sold by price and the average and median prices.
From the Census Bureau: &quot;The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2021 was $374,400.  The average sales price was $430,600.&quot;
The following graph shows the median and average new home prices.
 Click on graph for larger image.
During the housing bust, the builders had to build smaller and less expensive homes to compete with all the distressed sales.  When housing started to recovery - with limited finished lots in recovering areas - builders moved to higher price points to maximize profits.

Then the average and median house prices mostly moved sideways since 2017 due to home builders offering more lower priced homes.  Prices picked up during the pandemic, and really picked up recently.
The average price in May 2021 was $430,600, up 17% year-over-year.  The median price was $374,400, up 18% year-over-year.  
The second graph shows the percent of new homes sold by price.
Very few new homes sold were under $200K in May 2021 (about 1.4% of all homes).  This is down from 56% in 2002.  In general, the under $200K bracket is going away.    
The $400K and greater than $500K+ brackets increased significantly over the last decade.  A majority of new homes (about 61% in May) in the U.S., are in the $200K to $400K range.</span>

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 9.9% compared to the same week in 2019.  Leisure (weekend) occupancy has recovered, but weekday (more business) is still down double digits.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Occupancy Reaches Highest Level in More Than 19 Weeks
U.S. weekly hotel occupancy hit its highest level in 85 weeks, according to STR‘s latest data through June 19.
June 13-19, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 68.0% (-9.9%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$128.90 (-4.4%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$87.62 (-13.8%)
 In addition to occupancy reaching its highest point since the week ending November 9, 2019, ADR and RevPAR were pandemic-era highs.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is now above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the next two months should have decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.</span>

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021, according to the &quot;third&quot; estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the fourth quarter, real GDP increased 4.3 percent.
  
The “third” estimate of GDP released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the &quot;second&quot; estimate issued last month. In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was also 6.4 percent. Upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment, private inventory investment, and exports were offset by an upward revision to imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP

                    <span>Many believe that the global trading system could offer little more to least developed countries beyond the various unilateral preferential schemes currently in place. This column argues that there is room for new multilateral initiatives to strengthen the participation of these countries in global value chains. It avocates for a new ‘GVCs for LDCs’ global preferential scheme based on least developed countries’ value added, thereby covering exports by these countries along the entire supply chain. Estimates suggest that such a scheme would increase global trade, improve least developed countries’ value added, and promote further value chain integration between these and other developing countries.</span>

                    <span>Many expert product reviews are non-blind and influenced by cosy relationships between reviewers and producers that consumers are not aware of. The downside of biased reviews is largely unknown because of a lack of data and small sample sizes. Based on unique data for a long-running expert product review in the food-service industry, this column finds that a conflict of interests for reviewers led to a sizeable bias in ratings. This casts doubt on the value of non-blind expert product reviews that are not bound by very strict rules.</span>

                    <span>Surveys are an often unreliable method for measuring top incomes, due largely to low compliance rates among rich households. This column proposes a way to correct for selective compliance. Using the geographic distribution of survey-response rates to calculate how the household-level probability of agreeing to be interviewed varies with own-income and other covariates, the method improves on ad hoc approaches to reweighting survey data. A behavioural micro model of compliance can more accurately reveal top income recipients, thereby updating tax records and refining redistributive policies.</span>

Demand for design services from U.S. architecture firms continues to grow at a vigorous pace, according to a new report today from The American Institute of Architects (AIA).
  
AIA’s Architecture Billings Index (ABI) score for May rose to 58.5 compared to 57.9 in April (any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings). May’s ABI score is one of the highest in the index’s 25-year history. During May, the new design contracts score reached its second consecutive record high with a score of 63.2, while new project inquiries also recorded a near-record high score at 69.2.

• The national delinquency rate rose to 4.73% from 4.66% in April, driven largely by the three-day Memorial Day weekend foreshortening available payment windows
  
• Similar occurrences are rare; the last time was in May 2004, at which time mortgage delinquencies jumped by more than 15% in a single month; this month saw a 1.5% increase

                    <span>New home sales for May were reported at 769,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis (SAAR). Sales for the previous three months were revised down significantly.
This was well below consensus expectations for May, but still the highest sales rate for May since 2007.

However, sales were in line with home builder comments about &quot;limiting sales&quot; in April and May mostly due to high material costs.


Still, sales have been strong for the last year.  Clearly low mortgages rates, low existing home supply, and favorable demographics have boosted sales.  A surging stock market has probably helped new home sales too.
Earlier: New Home Sales Decrease to 769,000 Annual Rate in May.

However, sales will likely be down year-over-year in the 2nd half of 2021 (maybe June) - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
And on inventory: note that completed inventory (3rd graph in previous post) is near record lows, but inventory under construction is closer to normal.
This graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction.
  
The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 36 thousand in May, just above the record low of 33 thousand in April 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (just above the record low).

The inventory of new homes under construction, and not started, is at 4.6 months - a normal level.</span>

                    <span>The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 769 thousand.
The previous three months were revised down sharply, combined. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in May 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 769,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 5.9 percent below the revised April rate of 817,000, but is 9.2 percent above the May 2020 estimate of 704,000.

인간다운 삶을 위한 최소 소득을 보장하기 위해 국가나 지방자치단체가 모든 개인에게 조건 없이 정기적으로 현금을 지급하는 기본소득. 양극화 해소와 4차 산업혁명에 따른 사회경제적 변화에 대처할 수 있는 획기적인 정책으로 기대된다. 그러나 이 같은 취지의 제도도 재원 마련이라는 난관을 해결하는 것이 관건이다. 

기본소득 재원으로 ‘국토보유세’를 제시한 이 책은 개인과 법인이 가진 모든 토지에 세금을 매겨 전 국민에게 똑같이 나누면 불평등의 주요 원인인 토지 불로소득도 잡고 기본소득의 재원도 마련할 수 있어 ‘일석이조’라고 설명한다. 또한 과세대상자의 95%는 내는 세금보다 기본소득으로 받는 금액이 더 많은 순수혜가구인 ‘기본소득형 국토보유세’는 조세 저항의 부담도 적다는 것.  

『답이 있는 기본소득』은 이 같은 기본소득형 국토보유세 설계를 위해 부동산 실태 및 보유세제 개편 방향과 경제적 영향력을 치밀하게 분석했으며 입법안까지 제시하는 등 국토보유세를 둘러싼 모든 쟁점들에 대해 상세히 답을 밝히고 있다. 

기본소득형 국토보유세를 통해 ‘부동산 공화국’, ‘불로소득 공화국’이라는 오명을 벗고 21세기형 경제정의를 구현할 기본소득을 현실화시킬 수 있을지 길을 보여주는 책이다.

데이터 분석을 다룬 많은 책 중 나에게 맞는 책을 찾는 건 매우 어렵다. 이론 위주의 책을 선택하면 이해하기 어렵고, 응용 위주의 책을 선택하면 기본 개념이 부족하다. 이 책은 이론을 쉽게 설명하고 예제로 응용해 보도록 구성하여 자연스럽게 데이터 분석 과정을 익힐 수 있다.

파이썬 데이터 분석에 필수로 사용되는 라이브러리를 단계적으로 다루어 데이터를 전처리하고 분석하는 능력을 갖춘다. 이 과정에서 넘파이, 판다스, 맷플롯립은 물론 연관 라이브러리까지 상세히 소개한다. 그리고 소개한 라이브러리를 종합하여 활용할 수 있는 세 가지 실전 예제를 담았다.

                    <span>While multilateral trade negotiations have stagnated and tensions between major players have surged, bilateral and regional agreements seem to have run away with the trade agenda. There are over 300 agreements today, up from 50 in 1990. Most importantly, many of these agreements have extended their reach well beyond tariffs, aiming to achieve integration beyond trade, or ‘deep’ integration. This column introduces a new eBook from CEPR and the World Bank that focuses on the determinants of deep trade agreements, how they affect trade and non-trade outcomes, and how they might shape trade relations in a post-COVID-19 world.</span>

                    <span>Research has shown that multinational enterprises located in the US account for roughly 90% of US exports of goods and for over 90% of exports of selected services. While these estimates show that multinationals clearly dominate trading activity of gross exports, they overstate the role of multinationals in US exports since non-multinationals are an important part of the production supply chain and make significant contributions to the value embodied in these exports. This column uses experimental Trade in Value Added statistics estimated from extended supply-use tables for the US for 2005 and 2012 to show that both multinational and non-multinational firms contribute significant amounts of content embodied in US exports.</span>

                    <span>Earlier: NAR: Existing-Home Sales Decreased to 5.80 million in May
A few key points:
1) Existing home sales are getting close to pre-pandemic levels.  Although seasonally adjusted (SA) sales for May were the highest since 2006, sales Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) in May 2021 were below the sales for May in 2017, 2018 and 2019. 

Some of the increase over the previous ten months was probably related to  record low mortgage rates, a move away from multi-family rentals, strong second home buying (to escape the high-density cities), a strong stock market and favorable demographics.


Also, the delay in the 2020 buying season pushed the seasonally adjusted number to very high levels over the winter.   This means there are going to be some difficult comparisons in the second half of 2021!

Existing-home sales decreased for a fourth straight month in May, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Only one major U.S. region recorded a month-over-month increase, while the other three regions saw sales decline. However, each of the four areas again registered double-digit year-over-year gains.
  
Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, dropped 0.9% from April to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.80 million in May. Sales in total climbed year-over-year, up 44.6% from a year ago (4.01 million in May 2020).

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: No Easy Victories For Mortgage Rates
10yr yields may have hit their lowest levels in months in the wee hours of the morning and people may always perceive a bit too much correlation between 10yr yields and mortgage rates, but the latter didn&#x27;t have quite the same success.  To be fair, Treasuries ended up losing ground as the day progressed, but even so, they are nearer to their recent lows than mortgage rates. [30 year fixed 3.25%]

This column examines whether this means that large US firms have more market power in the manufacturing sector. It shows that tougher import competition contributed to the rise in the dominance of large US firms over the last few decades, but also reduced US firms’ market share (as a share of all sales inclusive of foreign firms) in the US market. These findings suggest that US firms’ market power in manufacturing industries has in fact declined as foreign firms’ market share has grown.</span>

지난해 하반기 이후 우리나라의 금융시스템은 대체로 안정된 모습을 유지하였다. 코로나19 재확산 움직임에도 불구하고 경기회복 기대가 커지면서 금융시장은 비교적 안정세를 보였고, 금융중개기능도 원활히 작동하였다. 전반적인 금융시스템 상황을 보여주는 금융안정지수(FSI)는 작년 4월 위기단계 진입 이후 하락세를 지속하여 금년 5월에는 주의단계 임계치(8)를 하회하는 1.8(잠정)까지 낮아졌다.
    


    
금융안정 상황을 부문별로 살펴보면, 신용시장의 경우 가계와 기업 모두 차입을 늘리면서 민간신용의 높은 증가세가 이어지는 가운데 명목GDP 성장률이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 명목GDP 대비 민간신용 비율이 큰 폭 상승하였다. 가계신용은 주택 매매·전세 관련 대출 증가 등의 영향으로 증가세가 확대된 반면 가계의 처분가능소득 증가율이 낮은 수준을 지속하면서 가계의 채무상환부담이 늘어났다.
    


    
기업신용도 코로나19 장기화 등에 따른 자금수요 지속 등으로 증가세를 이어갔다. 기업의 전반적인 재무상황이 개선되고 있으나 기업간 채무상환능력의 차이는 심화되었다. 한편 가계 및 기업 대출 연체율이 낮은 수준을 유지하고 있으나 향후 경기회복이 부문간·업종간 차별화되는 양상을 보일 경우 가계와 기업의 취약부문을 중심으로 부실 위험이 커질 수 있다.

                    <span>A period that is somewhat similar to the current housing market was in the late 1970s.
House prices increased 14.7% in 1977, 15.7% in 1978 and 13.9% in 1979 (Case-Shiller National Index).
Over the last 12 months, house prices have increased 13.2%.
And currently demographics are favorable for home buying with a large cohort moving into their 30s, just like in the late 70s, with the leading-edge boomers turning 31 in 1977.

But there are stark differences too.


First, inflation was very high in the late &#x27;70s, averaging close to 9% over those 3 years.   Inflation over the last year was up 5.0%, but that was mostly over the last few months - and is likely transitory (inflation was embedded in the late &#x27;70s).


Another major difference is housing inventories are much lower today (a key reason …</span>

Tracking inventory will be very important this year.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of June 18th, inventory was at 353 thousand (7 day average), compared to 690 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 48.8%.


A week ago, inventory was at 342 thousand, and was down 51.0% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 15.3% above the low in early April.

                    <span>In this paper, we study the role of information in non-market valuation. We develop a variant of the Rosen-Roback model of inter-urban sorting that incorporates public access to information about air quality, and demonstrate that information constraints create a wedge between the revealed and true hedonic prices.  Moreover, the direction and the magnitude of that wedge depends on the individual’s perception bias. We empirically test our theoretical predictions by leveraging a natural experiment – the unexpected disclosure of PM2.5 data in China. We find that perception bias before the data disclosure leads to a downward estimation bias in hedonic valuation.  The hedonic price of avoiding PM2.5 exposure increases substantially from 171 to 336 Chinese Yuan in response to the information shock. Our work sheds light on the application of Rosen-Roback theory for non-market valuation in countries where the public access to information is restricted.</span>

                    <span>Following the widespread adoption of free primary education, African policymakers are now considering making secondary school free, but little is known about the private and social benefits of free secondary education. We exploit randomized assignment to secondary school scholarships among 2,064 youths in Ghana, combined with 12 years of data, to establish that scholarships increase educational attainment, knowledge, skills, and preventative health behaviors, while reducing female fertility. Eleven years after receipt of the scholarship, only female winners show private labor market gains, but those come primarily in the form of better access to jobs with rents (in particular rationed jobs in the public sector). We develop a simple model to interpret the labor market results and help think through the welfare impact of free secondary education.</span>

                    <span>Green assets delivered high returns in recent years. This performance reflects unexpectedly strong increases in environmental concerns, not high expected returns. German green bonds outperformed their higher-yielding non-green twins as the &quot;greenium&quot; widened, and U.S. green stocks outperformed brown as climate concerns strengthened. To show the latter, we construct a theoretically motivated green factor—a return spread between environmentally friendly and unfriendly stocks—and find that its positive performance disappears without climate-concern shocks. The factor lags those shocks, curiously, by about a month. A theory-driven two-factor model featuring the green factor explains much of the recent underperformance of value stocks.</span>

                    <span>This paper uses data from 802,777 veterans assigned to 7,548 primary care providers (PCPs) within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to examine variations in the efficacy of primary care providers (PCPs), their consequences for health outcomes, and their determinants. Leveraging quasi-random assignment of veterans to PCPs, we measure PCP effectiveness along three dimensions: the probability their patients have subsequent hospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions, circulatory conditions, or a hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). We find a significant range in these effectiveness measures across PCPs. For example, a one standard deviation improvement in our measure of mental health effectiveness predicts a 0.21 percentage point (3.8%) lower risk of patient death over the next three years and 4.4% lower total costs. We also find moderate correlations between the three metrics, indicating that doctors who are effective at treating one type of condition also tend to be more effective in treating others. Our strongest conclusion is that more effective PCPs do more with less: Their patients have fewer primary care visits, referrals to specialists, lab panels or imaging tests.  Effective PCPs are slightly more likely to comply with guidelines for mental health screenings, and slightly less likely to comply with guidelines for physical health screenings, but these differences in screening propensities are negligible in magnitude.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic led to stark reductions in economic activity in India. We employ CMIE&#x27;s Consumer Pyramids Household Survey to examine the timing, distribution, and mechanism of the impacts from this shock on income and consumption through December 2020.  First, we estimate large and heterogeneous drops in income, with ambiguous effects on inequality.  While incomes of salaried workers fell 35%; incomes of daily laborers fell 75%.  At the same time, we observe that income fell more for individuals from households in the highest income quartile.  Second, we document an increase in effort to buffer income shocks by switching occupations.  We employ a Roy Model to estimate the gains from occupation churn and find, surprisingly, that reservation wages fell, implying that the risk of COVID did not reduce the value of employment.  Third, we find that consumption fell less than income, suggesting households were able to smooth the idiosyncratic components of the COVID shock as well as they did before COVID.  Finally, consumption of food and fuel fell less than consumption of durables such as clothing and appliances.  Following Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001), we estimate Engel curves and find that changes in consumption reflect large price shocks (rather than a retreat to subsistence) in sectors other than food and fuel/power.  In the food sector, it appear that lockdown successfully distinguished essential and non-essential services, at least to the extent that it did not increase the relative price of food.  There is some suggestive evidence that the price shocks outside the food sector were larger in places with greater COVID-19 cases, even during the lockdown.</span>

                    <span>State governments face the classic “make or buy” decision for the provision of Medicaid services. Over the past two decades, the majority of states have outsourced the provision of social health insurance through Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) programs. These programs have been extensively studied in the literature – with little evidence of large positive or negative effects. However, most states initially allowed older and sicker enrollees to remain enrolled in the government run fee for service (FFS) programs. It is possible that these more fragile enrollees could have a different experience in managed care. In this paper we study California’s mandatory enrollment of the senior and persons with disabilities (SPD) population in MMC. We find this mandatory enrollment caused an increased use of the emergency department and transfers between hospitals. This was not simply a hassle cost for enrollees – we also estimate an increase in mortality for the affected population. These effects were strongest for the sickest enrollees – the types of enrollees that might be expected to have a different experience with managed care. Our results suggest the adverse impact of MMC varies by the enrollee health, which should inform the optimal outsourcing decision for governments.</span>

                    <span>In settings where an individual’s labor choices are constrained, the inability to work may generate psychosocial harm. This paper presents a causal estimate of the psychosocial value of employment in the Rohingya refugee camps of Bangladesh. We engage 745 individuals in a field experiment with three arms: (1) a control arm, (2) a weekly cash arm, and (3) a gainful employment arm, in which work is offered and individuals are paid weekly the approximate equivalent of that in the cash arm. We find that employment confers significant psychosocial benefits beyond the impacts of cash alone, with effects concentrated among males. The cash arm does not improve psychosocial wellbeing, despite the provision of cash at a weekly amount that is more than twice the amount held by recipients in savings at baseline. Consistent with these findings, we find that 66% of those in our work treatment are willing to forego cash payments to instead work for free. Our results have implications for social protection policies for the unemployed in low income countries and refugee populations globally.</span>

                    <span>We introduce a model of the diffusion of an epidemic with demographically heterogeneous agents interacting socially on a spatially structured network. Contagion-risk averse agents respond behaviorally to the diffusion of the infections by limiting their social interactions. Firms also respond by allowing employees to work remotely, depending on their productivity. The spatial structure induces local herd immunities along sociodemographic dimensions, which significantly affect the dynamics of infections. We study several non-pharmaceutical interventions; e.g., i) lockdown rules, which set thresholds on the spread of the infection for the closing and reopening of economic activities; and ii) selective lockdowns, which restrict social interactions by location (in the network) and by the demographic characteristics of the agents. Substantiating a “Lucas critique” argument, we assess the cost of naive discretionary policies ignoring agents and firms’ behavioral responses.</span>

                    <span>We propose implied spreads (IS) and normalized implied spreads (NIS) as simple measures to characterize option prices. IS is the credit spread of an option’s implied bond, the portfolio long a risk-free bond and short a put option. NIS normalizes IS by the risk-neutral default probability and reflects tail risk. IS and NIS are countercyclical and predict implied bond returns, while neither, like implied volatility, predicts put returns. These opposite predictability results are consistent with a stochastic volatility, stochastic jump intensity model, as put premia increase in volatility but decrease in jump intensity, while implied bond premia increase in both.</span>

                    <span>This paper identifies and quantifies major determinants of future electric vehicle (EV) demand in order to inform widely-held aspirations for market growth. Our model compares three channels that will affect EV market share in the United States from 2020-2035: intrinsic (no-subsidy) EV demand growth, net-of-subsidy EV cost declines (e.g. batteries), and government subsidies. Geographic variation in preferences for sedans and light trucks highlights the importance of viable EV alternatives to conventional light trucks; belief in climate change is highly correlated with EV adoption patterns; and the first \$500 billion in cumulative nationwide EV subsidies is associated a 7-10 percent increase in EV market share in 2035, an effect that diminishes as subsidies increase. The rate of intrinsic demand growth dwarfs the impact of demand-side subsidies and battery cost declines, highlighting the importance of non-monetary factors (e.g. charging infrastructure, product quality and/or cultural acceptance) on EV demand.</span>

                    <span>As a way of slowing COVID-19 transmission, many countries and U.S. states implemented shelter-in-place (SIP) policies. However, the effects of SIP policies on public health are a priori ambiguous as they might have unintended adverse effects on health. The effect of SIP policies on COVID-19 transmission and physical mobility is mixed. To understand the net effects of SIP policies, we measure the change in excess deaths following the implementation of SIP policies in 43 countries and all U.S. states. We use an event study framework to quantify changes in the number of excess deaths after the implementation of a SIP policy. We find that following the implementation of SIP policies, excess mortality increases. The increase in excess mortality is statistically significant in the immediate weeks following SIP implementation for the international comparison only and occurs despite the fact that there was a decline in the number of excess deaths prior to the implementation of the policy. At the U.S. state-level, excess mortality increases in the immediate weeks following SIP introduction and then trends below zero following 20 weeks of SIP implementation. We failed to find that countries or U.S. states that implemented SIP policies earlier, and in which SIP policies had longer to operate, had lower excess deaths than countries/U.S. states that were slower to implement SIP policies. We also failed to observe differences in excess death trends before and after the implementation of SIP policies based on pre-SIP COVID-19 death rates.</span>

                    <span>In lower-income countries, the economic contractions that accompany lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 can increase child mortality, counteracting the mortality reductions achieved by the lockdown.  To formalize and quantify this effect, we build a macro-susceptible-infected-recovered model that features heterogeneous agents and a country-group-specific relationship between economic downturns and child mortality, and calibrate it to data for 85 countries across all income levels.  We find that in low-income countries, a lockdown can potentially lead to 1.76 children’s lives lost due to the economic contraction per COVID-19 fatality averted.  The ratio stands at 0.59 and 0.06 in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries, respectively.  As a result,  in  some  countries  lockdowns  actually  can  produce  net  increases  in  mortality. The optimal lockdowns are shorter and milder in poorer countries than in rich ones, and never produce a net mortality increase.</span>

                    <span>Two central insights from the Schumpeterian approach to innovation and growth are that the pace of innovation is endogenously determined by the expectation of future profits and that growth is inherently a process of creative destruction. As international trade is a key determinant of firm profitability and survival, it is natural to expect it to play a key role in shaping both incentives to innovate and the rate of creative destruction. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical literature on trade and innovation. We highlight four key mechanisms through which international trade affects endogenous innovation and growth: (i) market size; (ii) competition; (iii) comparative advantage; (iv) knowledge spillovers. Each of these mechanisms offers a potential source of dynamic welfare gains in addition to the static welfare gains from trade from conventional trade theory. Recent research has suggested that these dynamic welfare gains from trade can be substantial relative to their static counterparts. Discriminating between alternative mechanisms for these dynamic welfare gains and strengthening the evidence on their quantitative magnitude remain exciting areas of ongoing research.</span>

                    <span>We propose a model of collaborative work in pairs. Each potential partner draws an idea from a distribution that depends on their unobserved ability. The partners then choose to combine their ideas, or work separately. These decisions are based on the intrinsic value of their projects, but also on signaling payoffs, which depend on the public’s assessment of individual contributions to joint work. In equilibrium, collaboration strategies both justify and are justified by public assessments. When partners are symmetric, equilibria with symmetric collaborative strategies are often fragile, in a sense made precise in the paper. In such cases, asymmetric equilibria exist: upon observing a collaborative outcome, the public ascribes higher credit to one of the partners based on payoff-irrelevant “identities.” Such favored identities do receive a higher payoff relative to their disfavored counterparts conditional on collaborating, but may receive lower overall expected payoff. Finally, we study a policy that sometimes (but not always) clarifies the ordinal ranking of partners’ contributions, and find that such disclosures can be Pareto-improving and reduce the scope for discrimination across payoff-irrelevant identities.</span>

                    <span>We propose a rich model of household behavior to study the effect of two important policies: mortgage interest tax deduction and mandatory mortgage amortization. These policies have attracted some controversy, first because they are conceived to increase overall saving, an objective that the literature does not agree they can achieve, and second because they incentivize illiquid savings and may thus increase the share of ‘wealthy hand-to-mouth’ households. We build a life-cycle model where housing may act as a commitment device to counteract present biases arising from temptation. We show that the model matches several empirical facts, including the large share of wealthy hand-to-mouth households. We evaluate the effect of the two policies and find that they increase wealth accumulation by 7 and 10% respectively. Our results demonstrate that these policies not only induce portfolio re-balancing, as emphasized by the previous literature, but also increase savings by making commitment more accessible.</span>

                    <span>To understand leadership, it is necessary to understand the purpose of an organization. Organizations are hierarchies with leaders at the top. Why do we have leaders instead of an algorithm making decisions? The theory of the firm recognizes benefits to centralizing authority but these organizational benefits from hierarchy have not been clearly separated from the specific contributions of leaders. Leadership is the ability to successfully manage transaction costs of an organization. Prominent amongst organizational transaction costs are agency and coordination costs. The balance between these two types of costs depends on the purpose of the organization. We hypothesize that changing leaders is likely to have a larger effect within organizations with relatively lower scope or scale of purpose because of the way in which decision rights tend to be relatively concentrated in such organizations. We test our hypotheses with data on NFL coaches, and deans of business and law schools.</span>

We develop an economic model of digital addiction and estimate it using a randomized experiment. Temporary incentives to reduce social media use have persistent effects, suggesting social media are habit forming. Allowing people to set limits on their future screen time substantially reduces use, suggesting self-control problems. Additional evidence suggests people are inattentive to habit formation and partially unaware of self-control problems. Looking at these facts through the lens of our model suggests that self-control problems cause 31 percent of social media use.</span>

                    <span>We study the selection of Fellows of the Econometric Society, using a new data set of publications and citations for over 40,000 actively publishing economists since the early 1900s. Conditional on achievement, we document a large negative gap in the probability that women were selected as Fellows in the 1933-1979 period. This gap became positive (though not statistically significant) from 1980 to 2010, and in the past decade has become large and highly significant, with over a 100% increase in the probability of selection for female authors relative to males with similar publications and citations. The positive boost affects highly qualified female candidates (in the top 10% of authors) with no effect for the bottom 90%. Using nomination data for the past 30 years, we find a key proximate role for the Society&#x27;s Nominating Committee in this shift. Since 2012 the Committee has had an explicit mandate to nominate highly qualified women, and its nominees enjoy above-average election success (controlling for achievement). Looking beyond gender, we document similar shifts in the premium for geographic diversity: in the mid-2000s, both the Fellows and the Nominating Committee became significantly more likely to nominate and elect candidates from outside the US. Finally, we examine gender gaps in several other major awards for US economists. We show that the gaps in the probability of selection of new fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences closely parallel those of the Econometric Society, with historically negative penalties for women turning to positive premiums in recent years.</span>

                    <span>We examine how much of the overall decline in employment between the beginning of 2020 and 2021 can be explained by excess job loss among parents of young children, and mothers specifically. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we confirm that, in general, mothers with young children have experienced a larger decline in employment, as compared (unconditionally) with other adults, including fathers. This excess job loss is driven by mothers without a four-year college (bachelor’s) degree. The main point of the paper is to build off this observation and examine how much of the aggregate employment deficit in early 2021 can be explained by parent-specific issues, such as childcare struggles. To examine this question, we construct counterfactual employment rates and labor force participation rates that assign to mothers of young children the percent change in employment and labor force participation rates experienced by comparable women without young children. We consider multiple definition, sample, and counterfactual specification alternatives. Our analysis yields robust evidence that differential job loss among mothers of young children accounts for a negligible share of the ongoing aggregate employment deficit. The result is even stronger (and flips signs) if we consider all parents, since fathers with young children experienced less job loss than other men. The practical implication of these findings is that nearly all of the aggregate ongoing employment deficit is explained by factors that affect workers more broadly, as opposed to challenges specific to working parents.</span>

                    <span>This paper argues that rental market interactions allow small firms to increase their effective scale and mechanize production, even when each individual firm would be too small to invest in expensive machines. We conduct a novel survey of manufacturing firms in Uganda, which uncovers an active rental market for large machines between small firms in informal clusters. We then build an equilibrium model of firm behavior and estimate it with our data. Our results show that the rental market is quantitatively important for mechanization and productivity since it provides a workaround for other market imperfections that keep firms small. We also show that the rental market shapes the effectiveness of policies to foster mechanization, such as subsidies to purchase machines.</span>

                    <span>We study how the arrival of macro-news affects the stock market’s ability to incorporate the information in firm-level earnings announcements. Existing theories suggest that macro and firm-level earnings news are attention substitutes; macro-news announcements crowd out firm-level attention, causing less efficient processing of firm-level earnings announcements. We find the opposite: the sensitivity of announcement returns to earnings news is 17% stronger, and post-earnings announcement drift 71% weaker, on macro-news days. This suggests a complementary relationship between macro and micro news that is consistent with either investor attention or information transmission channels.</span>

                    <span>Despite growing interest in expectation surveys, critics argue that survey responses are not reliable measures of the expectations underlying financial decisions, and empirical work often finds only a weak correlation between investment and stated beliefs. In this paper, we document a systematic gap between an individual&#x27;s own forecasted returns and the beliefs used in investment decisions. In particular, perceived past housing returns predict individual real estate investment decisions even conditional on flexible controls for an individual&#x27;s forecasted distribution of future home-price growth. Many respondents acknowledge that they rely on past returns more than their survey-reported expected returns when making investment decisions, ruling out simple measurement-error explanations. To interpret these findings, we present evidence that investment decision-making induces cognitively uncertain investors to rely more on belief factors in which they are relatively confident, such as their estimation of recent local housing returns. Survey respondents that rely on past returns more than their surveyed forecasts frequently cite uncertainty about other belief factors as their rationale.</span>

                    <span>We develop a theoretically grounded extension of the two-way fixed effects model of Abowd et al. (1999) that allows firms to differ both in the wages they offer new hires and the wages required to poach their employees. Expected hiring wages are modeled as the sum of a worker fixed effect, a fixed effect for the “destination” firm hiring the worker, and a fixed effect for the “origin” firm, or labor market state, from which the worker was hired. This specification is shown to nest the reduced form for hiring wages delivered by semi-parametric formulations of the sequential auction model of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b) and its generalization in Bagger et al. (2014). Using Italian social security records that distinguish job quits from firings and layoffs, we find that origin effects explain only 0.7% of the variance of hiring wages among job movers, while destination effects explain more than 23% of the variance.  Across firms, destination effects are more than 13 times as variable as origin effects. Interpreted through the lens of Bagger et al. (2014)’s model, this finding requires that workers possess implausibly strong bargaining strength. Studying a cohort of workers entering the Italian labor market in 2005, we find that differences in origin effects yield essentially no contribution to the evolution of the gender gap in hiring wages, while differences in destination effects explain the majority of the gap at the time of labor market entry. These results suggest that where a worker is hired from is relatively inconsequential for his or her wages in comparison to where he or she is currently employed.</span>

                    <span>A belief that the environment rebounded during Covid-19 lockdowns is widespread. This column uncovers a more complex reality. Though domestic and international lockdowns prompted a 35–45% reduction in pollution, air quality effects across the world were unequal. When restrictions were placed on some economic activities (transport and industry), people shifted to others (domestic energy). Reductions in economic activities degrade the environment in countries where domestic energy is the largest source of pollution, and policies aimed at combatting climate change must account for such diverse outcomes.</span>

                    <span>In much of the world, property sales are highly regulated and expensive. Using World Bank data, this column shows that while regulators and administrators still pose barriers to transferring property, countries have actually seen tremendous progress in reducing compliance costs in the area of registering property over the past 15 years. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, moving public services online has provided opportunity to reduce compliance costs further by holding the level of regulation constant and easing the way in which it is administered.</span>

Here&#x27;s a housing Thread to chew on over weekend. Mid-June update from 100+home builders across country. 1) rumblings of price ceiling. 2) slightly shrinking pool of qualified buyers. 3) some home releases not selling out immediately. 4) normal summer slowing as vacations take priority. 
#Austin builder: “Some interest lists are shrinking &amp; others are not. Seeing buyers who are no longer able or willing to afford the monthly payment. Definitely seeing attrition here. Frustration that prices continued going up without an opportunity to purchase.” 
#Dallas builder: “Interest lists are definitely shrinking because of pricing.  Some drop off is happening due to price. But the re-sale market …</span>

                    <span>Despite the tragic deaths, suffering and sadness that it has caused, the pandemic could go down in history as the event that rescued humanity. This column argues that the pandemic has created a hinge moment of change, in which governments and citizens have demonstrated their ability to undertake reforms which would have been impossible before the pandemic. Sustaining and building on this momentum for reform is vital if we are to address the critical challenges facing humanity, stop future pandemics and build a more inclusive world of shared prosperity.</span>

                    <span>Many continental European countries give workers a formal right to voice via board-level or shop-floor elected representation, but evidence on the effects of these arrangements is scarce. This column examines reforms in Finland that introduced or expanded workers’ rights to voice institutions. Overall, the reforms had non-existent or small positive effects on turnover, job quality, firm survival, productivity, and capital intensity. It may be that Finnish worker voice institutions operate through information sharing and cooperation, which do not substantially improve worker outcomes but also do not harm firm performance.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve seen several housing booms and busts in my life.  The biggest boom was the housing bubble in the mid-&#x27;00s, and the worst bust followed the bubble.  Booms and bust have always been frequent in real estate.
My Spidey senses are tingling again, however it isn&#x27;t obvious why this time - or what the outcome will be.
In general, demographics are very favorable for home buying.  In Housing and Demographics: The Next Big Shift, I presented these graphs:

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of June 15th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Share of Borrowers in Forbearance Continues to Decline
Forbearance volumes held relatively steady this week, falling by a modest 7K amid an expected mid-month lull in activity, but are down by 117k (5.4%) from the same time last month.
  
Improvements among GSE (-6K) and FHA/VA (-4K) forbearance plans were partially offset by a 3K increase in the number of active plans among portfolio-held and privately securitized mortgages.
  
Both plan starts and exits fell this week, with removals down 50% from last week (due to typical mid-month behavior and month-end review cycles). Exits are expected to ramp up toward the end of this month, but more acutely in early July. Meanwhile, new plan starts saw one of their lowest weekly totals since the onset of the pandemic, continuing the trend of gradual declines in start activity.
  
Click on graph for larger image.
  
Some 400K plans are still scheduled for quarterly reviews for extension/removal over the next 2 weeks which could lead to additional plan exits as we near the 4th of July.
  
As of June 15, 2.06M (3.9% of) homeowners remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans including 2.3% of GSE, 6.9% of FHA/VA and 4.5% of Portfolio/PLS loans.

                    <span>The recent expansion in global corporate debt has occurred not only in one but in several debt markets, notably bonds and syndicated loans. This column argues that firms obtain financing in several debt markets and this more diversified corporate debt composition might help them mitigate the impact of supply-side shocks. Contrary to common beliefs, debt financing did not necessarily halt during crises because firms from advanced and emerging economies shifted their capital raising activity between bonds and syndicated loans as well as between domestic and international markets. These market switches, conducted mostly by large firms, impacted the amount of debt borrowed, the borrowing maturity, and the debt currency denomination, within firms and at the aggregate level. Overall, debt markets need to be analysed jointly to obtain a more complete picture of who is borrowing at different points in time and how overall corporate debt is evolving.</span>

This column uses data from Austria to examine the impact of downsizing by a firm on the health of people who remain at the firm. It finds a significant increase in drug prescriptions and hospitalisations following mass layoffs, driven primarily by mental and cardiovascular conditions. The authors argue that stress due to fear of job loss, rather than increased workloads, is the more likely explanation.</span>

                    <span>From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.78 million in May, down 1.2% from April’s preliminary pace but up 44.1% from last May’s seasonally adjusted pace.
Local realtor/MLS data suggest that the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 22.4% from last May.

CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release May existing home sales on Tuesday, June 22, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 5.74 million SAAR.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m gathering existing home data for many local markets, and I&#x27;m watching inventory very closely this year.
As I noted in Some thoughts on Housing Inventory 
The key for housing in 2021 will be inventory. If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in house prices. However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.
The table below shows some data for May.
Although inventory in these areas is down about 54% year-over-year, inventory is mostly unchanged month-to-month.  Seasonally we&#x27;d usually expect an increase in inventory from April to May.   

It does appear inventory bottomed seasonally in March.

Note: California reported a 6.6% increase in active inventory from April to May, but they don&#x27;t report the actual numbers - so California isn&#x27;t include in the table below.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 10.3% compared to the same week in 2019.  Leisure (weekend) occupancy has recovered, but weekday (more business) is still down double digits.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Occupancy at Highest Weekly Level Since November 2019
U.S. hotel occupancy reached its highest weekly level since early November 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through June 12.
June 6-12, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 66.0% (-10.3%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$125.16 (-7.0%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$82.65 (-16.6%)
 While weekday occupancy was still down double digits from the corresponding days in 2019, weekend occupancy was 0.2% (Friday) and 3.2% (Saturday) higher than the 2019 comparables. On a total-room-inventory basis, which includes those hotels temporarily closed due to the pandemic, total week occupancy was higher than 60% for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. ADR and RevPAR were also the highest of the pandemic era on an absolute basis.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is now above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.</span>

미래차의 등장과 함께 자동차 산업은 하루가 다르게 급변하고 있다. 주가도 하루가 다르게 변하고 있다. 1950년대 자동차 산업의 대호황기 때와 비교할 수도 없을 만큼 화려하고 거대한 호황기가 오고 있다. 자동차 산업의 패러다임이 송두리째 변하기 때문이다. 심지어 플랫폼, 승차 공유 등 모빌리티의 영역은 그 끝을 알 수 없을 만큼 빠르게 확장되는 중이다.

이제 지금까지의 자동차 산업 투자 전략은 의미가 없다. 근본부터가 변했다. 산업이 변하고 시선이 변한 만큼 투자 지도도 새롭게 그려야 한다. 말 그대로 판을 다시 짜야 하는 셈이다. 새롭게 전략을 짜는 방법은 『지금, 모빌리티에 투자하라』에 모두 담겨 있다.

증권가에서 가장 뛰어난 자동차 분야 애널리스트 유지웅이 친절하게 그려주는 투자 지도가 궁금하다면 지금 바로 펼쳐보자. 상상하지 못했던 냉철한 산업 분석과 명쾌한 모빌리티 투자 전략을 따라가다 보면 어느새 당신만의 투자 전략이 세워져 있을 것이다.

기존의 데이터 분석 및 통계학 책들과는 다르다. 실제 사회과학 분야에서 쓰이는 데이터를 먼저 접한 후 R을 사용해서 기본적인 데이터 분석과 프로그래밍을 연습하는 순서로 구성돼 있다. 데이터 분석과 통계학을 처음 배우는 모든 사람을 위한 책이며, 독자들은 데이터 분석의 재미를 발견할 수 있을 것이다. 

더 나아가 데이터 분석을 활용해 사회과학자들이 사회적 문제 및 인간 행동양식에 대한 결론과 중요한 해답을 어떻게 제시하는지 살펴볼 수 있다. 데이터 과학 분야의 실무종사자, 사회과학 분야의 학부생, 대학원생 및 연구자들에게 도움이 될 것이다.

                    <span>The extent that trade volume can reveal asymmetric information among foreign exchange market participants is the subject of debate among economists, as are the questions surrounding how the dispersion of information can affect currency returns. This column presents new evidence that foreign exchange volume reveals insights into both issues. The authors find that a high level of information asymmetry exists across foreign exchange market participants, and that this asymmetry is independent of currencies’ average level of liquidity, volatility and volume.</span>

For the entire state of Alabama:
Closed sales in May 2021 were 6,936, up 27.6% from 5,434 in May 2020.
Active Listings in May 2021 were 9,363, down 45.1% from 17,042 in May 2020.

From MarketWatch: CDC says Delta COVID variant is ‘of concern,’ as experts warn of higher risks of infection and serious illness
The good news is the vaccines are very effective against the Delta variant for the fully vaccinated.  The bad news - for the unvaccinated - is that the Delta variant is much more contagious than the previous variants, and also appears to be more virulent. Since it takes 5 to 6 week to become fully vaccinated, the unvaccinated should get their first shot now!
 This data is from the CDC.

Fed Chair Powell press conference video here starting at 2:30 PM ET.
Here are the projections.  In March, most participants expected rates to remain at the current level through 2023.  Now, most participants expect around two rates hikes in 2023. 
Note that real GDP increased 6.4% annualized in Q1.   And forecasts are for GDP to increase close to 10% in Q2 and Q3.

So GDP was revised up for 2021.

FOMC Statement: 
The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.
  
Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

Closed escrow sales of existing, single-family detached homes in California totaled a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 445,660 in May, according to information collected by C.A.R. from more than 90 local REALTOR® associations and MLSs statewide.

                    <span>Earlier: Housing Starts increased to 1.572 Million Annual Rate in May

Total housing starts in May were below expectations, and starts in March and April were revised down slightly. Supply constraints probably held back housing starts again in May.   


Single family starts increased in May, and were up 51% year-over-year (starts declined at the beginning of the pandemic). 


The volatile multi-family sector is up sharply year-over-year (apartments were under pressure from COVID).
The housing starts report showed total starts were up 3.6% in May compared to the previous month, and total starts were up 50.3% year-over-year compared to May 2020.

Low mortgage rates and limited existing home inventory have given a boost to single family housing starts.

Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,572,000.

Single‐family housing starts in May were at a rate of 1,098,000; this is 4.2 percent above the revised April figure of 1,054,000. The May rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 465,000. 
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,681,000.  This is 3.0 percent below the revised April rate of 1,733,000, but is 34.9 percent above the May 2020 rate of 1,246,000.  Single‐family authorizations in May were at a rate of 1,130,000; this is 1.6 percent below the revised April figure of 1,148,000.

세계 반도체 공급망을 재편하기 위한 미국과 중국 간의 기술 패권 경쟁이 갈수록 뜨거워지는 양상이다. 중국은 2030년까지 인공지능 선도국가가 되겠다는 야심찬 계획을 발표했고, 미국 역시 전면전을 선언하며 주도권 사수에 나섰다. 세계 패권을 지키려는 미국과 패권에 도전하는 중국의 각축전은 국내 반도체 산업에도 적잖은 파장을 예고하고 있다.

엄청난 변화는 엄청난 기회를 가져오기 마련이다. ‘한국에서 가장 신뢰할 수 있는 애널리스트’이자 2021년 여의도에서 가장 많이 회자된 리포트의 주인공이기도 한 SK증권의 김영우 이사는 『반도체 투자 전쟁』을 통해 지금 시점에서 반드시 주목해야 할 반도체 전쟁의 현재와 미래를 통찰했다. 

이 책을 통해 더 깊이 있게 미국과 중국의 전략을 이해하고, 이 전쟁이 반도체 산업에 미치는 영향을 파악해본다면, 우리 정책의 방향성은 물론 투자자들에게 찾아온 커다란 기회가 무엇인지도 분명하게 보일 것이다.

지역화폐란 지역경제 활성화를 위해 사용하는 대안화폐를 말한다. 지역시민이 기획하고 참여하기 때문에 ‘민주주의적인 화폐’로 평가받기도 한다. 최근 지역화폐는 지역경기의 활성화와 지역공동체 회복을 위한 도구로 주목받고 있다. 

『뉴머니, 지역화폐의 현재와 미래』는 『뉴머니, 지역화폐가 온다』(2020년 간행)에 이은 책으로 후자가 지역화폐의이론과 실제를 살펴보고 적합한 발전 모형을 찾기 위해 수행한 연구성과를 총 정리함으로써 더 풍요롭고 인간다운 삶을 살게 해주는 도구로 자리매김할 수 있도록 지역화폐를 가꿔나가야 한다는 주장을 담고 있는데 반해, 전자는 좀더 깊이 들어가 ‘경기도 소상공인을 중심으로 지역화폐의 도입목적에 따라 과연 매출증대, 역내소비 진작을 통한 골목상권, 지역경제가 활성화 되었는가’ 라는 효과를 구체적으로 검증한 책이다. 

특히 코로나 19의 전후에 시행된 지역화폐 제도를 통해 나타난 효과를 상권별, 업종별, 유형별로 구제적인 데이터로 정리함으로써 지역화폐가 소상공인 매출액 증대에 긍정적인 영향을 일으키고 있음을 보여주고 있다. 그러나 향후 과제는 지역화폐가 소비를 얼마나 진작시켰는가를 좀더 구체적으로 분석할 필요가 있다.

                    <span>In its latest assessment of the euro area fiscal stance, the European Fiscal Board concludes that national policy plans for 2022 amount to an appropriate fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole. This column discusses how, against the backdrop of a strong economic rebound this year and next and the unwinding of emergency measures, the underlying fiscal deficit of the euro area should halve between 2021 and 2022, while nevertheless remaining well above pre-crisis levels. With significant fiscal support still in the pipeline, more targeted measures should avoid excess economic scarring and encourage sustainable growth while facilitating the green and digital transitions.</span>

                    <span>Tax expenditures – such as tax incentives for firms, tax deductions for households, and lower tax rates for specific goods and services – are are both widespread and costly, but are generally not subject to the same level of scrutiny in the budget process as direct spending. This column introduces the Global Tax Expenditures Database, which aims to improve reporting and enhance scrutiny. As governments worldwide face growing funding needs to respond to the pandemic, they cannot afford to lose revenues to ill-designed tax breaks. Comprehensively assessing tax expenditures is crucial, and estimating and reporting their fiscal cost is a vital first step.</span>

                    <span>Labour mobility is a key criterion for assessing optimum currency areas. To smooth country-specific shocks or business cycles in currency unions, it is key that people migrate across the countries or regions of the union. This column argues that the ongoing discussion about risk sharing in the euro area neglects the issue of labour mobility. Relative to the US, migration rates in the euro area are significantly lower and migration contributes less to overall risk sharing. It calls for a renewed focus on the principle of labour mobility in order to enhance risk sharing in the euro area.</span>

                    <span>Three months ago, from Jann Swanson at MortgageNewsDaily: Fannie Warns Lenders on Investment Properties and 2nd Homes.  This action will result in higher interest rates on 2nd home and investment property mortgages.
I&#x27;m looking at data for some second home markets - and will track those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through May 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.
  
   Click on graph for larger image.
Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Note that inventory was high while prices were declining - and significantly lower inventory in 2012 suggested the bust was over.  (Tracking inventory helped me call the bottom for housing way back in February 2012, see:The Housing Bottom is Here)
Currently inventory is just above the record low set two months ago, and prices are up sharply YoY.   This will be interesting to watch.</span>

                    <span>Note: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation&#x27;s container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was up 3.7% in May compared to the rolling 12 months ending in April.   Outbound traffic was up 0.2% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 has started off incredibly strong for imports.
Imports were up 58% YoY in May (collapsed last year due to pandemic), and exports were up 2.6% YoY.</span>

From the NAHB: Rising Material Challenges, Declining Builder Sentiment
Rising material prices and supply chain shortages resulted in builder confidence dipping to its lowest level since August 2020. The latest National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today shows that builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes fell two points to 81 in June. Despite the monthly decline, the reading above 80 is still a signal of strong demand in a housing market lacking inventory.

                    <span>From the Fed: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Total industrial production increased 0.8 percent in May. Manufacturing production advanced 0.9 percent, reflecting, in part, a large gain in motor vehicle assemblies; factory output excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.5 percent. The indexes for mining and utilities rose 1.2 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.
  
In May, at 99.9 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production was 16.3 percent higher than it was a year earlier but 1.4 percent lower than its pre-pandemic (February 2020) level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose 0.6 percentage point in May to 75.2 percent, a rate that is 4.4 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

This graph shows Capacity Utilization. This series is up from the record low set in April, but still below the level in February 2020.
Capacity utilization at 75.2% is 4.4% below the average from 1972 to 2020.
Note: y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the change.

The second graph shows industrial production since 1967.
Industrial production increased in May to 106.3.  This is 1.4% below the February 2020 level.
The change in industrial production was below consensus expectations.</span>

The new week wasted no time in differentiating itself from the previous week as bonds sold off somewhat briskly this morning. ... The bigger question of &quot;where do we go from here&quot; may depend on the incoming data and especially Wednesday afternoon&#x27;s Fed announcement/forecasts.  Despite the early selling pressure, bonds offered some reassurance in the afternoon by holding calmly under 1.50%. [30 year fixed 3.05%]

김경록 미래에셋투자와연금센터 대표가 경제학, 인구론, 투자 전략을 통해 우리나라와 세계 경제의 흐름을 짚어보고 앞으로 투자 시장의 핵심 테마로 떠오를 메가 트렌드 데모테크(Demotech)를 소개한 책이다.

인구와 기술은 곧 수요와 공급이다. 인구는 물건을 수요하고, 기술은 물건을 공급한다. 고령화와 기술 혁신의 결합은 값싸고 질 좋고 혁신적인 제품이 대량 쏟아져 나오고, 이를 수요할 계층 또한 많아진다는 뜻이다. 우리는 가위의 양날처럼 고령화와 기술 혁신이라는 두 메가 트렌드로 수요 확장과 공급 확장이 동시에 일어나는 역사적 변곡점을 맞고 있다.

이 교차점에서 형성되는 메가 트렌드가 바로 인구(Demography)와 기술(Technology)이 만나는 데모테크(DemoTech)다. 이곳이 앞으로 거대한 부가 만들어지는 어장이 된다. 코로나19 이후 기대와 우려가 공존하는 투자 시장에서 순간의 바람에 흔들리지 않고 자신의 투자 철학과 전략을 세우고 싶다면 《데모테크가 온다》에 주목하라.

경제학은 대체 어떤 학문인지, 경제학에 필요한 능력은 어떤 능력인지, 경제학은 철학, 과학, 예술과 연결될 수 있을지, 경제학은 무엇을 위한 학문인지 이 질문에 대한 답을 찾아내게 된다면, 나는 무엇을, 어떻게, 왜 해야 할지에 대한 길을 선명하게 그려낼 수 있을 것이다. 그래서 이 책은 스물넷의 평범한 대학생이 자신만의 길을 찾아가는 모습이 담겨있으면서도, 경제학의 정의, 방법, 목적 그리고 다른 예술 및 학문과의 연계 가능성에 대해서 새로운 관점도 제시한다.

                    <span>The newly launched CEPR Competition Policy RPN is organizing a discussion between senior antitrust regulators, privacy experts, and economists. In the first panel, privacy and data protection experts will discuss some key insights for antitrust enforcers. The second panel will discuss with antitrust leaders how these ideas are progressing in practice.
Christina Caffarra &amp; Greg Crawford tell Tim Phillips what people who sign up for the the launch event of the CEPR Competition Policy RPN on June 17 2021 can expect from it.

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a collective shift to working from home. This column argues that though the shift was surprisingly easy, returning to the office will be hard. New evidence from a survey of 2,500 employees in the UK shows a preference in favour of home working 2-3 days a week, with lingering concerns of overcrowded transport and offices. But allowing workers to choose when to work from home will leave empty offices Monday and Friday, and many tasks such as large group meetings are more effective in person than online. Hybrid working will be the solution.</span>

                    <span>Global value chain analyses to examine the income gains from trade are particularly complicated by ownership relations between headquarters and subsidiaries. The consequence is that the value added generated within one country may well result in income in another country. This column presents the income perspective as a framework to deal with this complication. Trade deficits become smaller for wealthy countries and larger for developing countries. Discussions on ‘unfair’ trade should take the income perspective on board.</span>

                    <span>Note: This is not Mortgage Equity Withdrawal (MEW) data from the Fed. The last MEW data from Fed economist Dr. Kennedy was for Q4 2008.
The following data is calculated from the Fed&#x27;s Flow of Funds data (released last week) and the BEA supplement data on single family structure investment. This is an aggregate number, and is a combination of homeowners extracting equity - hence the name &quot;MEW&quot; - and normal principal payments and debt cancellation (modifications, short sales, and foreclosures).
For Q1 2021, the Net Equity Extraction was $41 billion, or 0.8% of Disposable Personal Income (DPI) .   This is nothing like the amount of equity extraction during the housing bubble as a percent of DPI.
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows the net equity extraction, or mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), results, using the Flow of Funds (and BEA data) compared to the Kennedy-Greenspan method. 
MEW has been mostly positive for the last five years.
The Fed&#x27;s Flow of Funds report showed that the amount of mortgage debt outstanding increased by $117 billion in Q1.
For reference:
Dr. James Kennedy also has a simple method for calculating equity extraction: &quot;A Simple Method for Estimating Gross Equity Extracted from Housing Wealth&quot;. Here is a companion spread sheet (the above uses my simple method).
For those interested in the last Kennedy data included in the graph, the spreadsheet from the Fed is available here.</span>

Closed sales in May 2021 were 9,334, up 46.1% from 6,389 in May 2020.
Active Listings in May 2021 were 7,490, down 56.6% from 17,254 in May 2020.

Tracking inventory will be very important this year.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of June 11th, inventory was at 342 thousand (7 day average), compared to 698 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 51.0%.


A week ago, inventory was at 329 thousand, and was down 53.3% YoY.  Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.  


Inventory was about 11.6% above the low in early April.

                    <span>The delayed retirement credit (DRC) increases monthly OASI (Old Age and Survivors Insurance) benefits for primary beneficiaries who claim after their full retirement age (FRA). For many years, the DRC was set at 3.0 percent per year (0.25 percent monthly). The 1983 amendments to Social Security more than doubled this actuarial adjustment to 8.0 percent per year. These changes were phased in gradually, so that those born in 1924 or earlier retained a 3.0 percent DRC while those born in 1943 or later had an 8.0 percent DRC. In this paper, we use administrative data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to estimate the effect of this policy change on individual claiming behavior. We focus on the first half of the DRC increase (from 3.0 to 5.5 percent) given changes in other SSA policies that coincided with the later increases. Our findings demonstrate that the increase in the DRC led to a significant increase in delayed claiming of social security benefits and strongly suggest that the effects were larger for those with higher lifetime incomes, who would have a greater financial incentive to delay given their longer life expectancies.</span>

                    <span>Army cadets obtain occupations through a centralized process. Three objectives – increasing retention, aligning talent, and enhancing trust – have guided reforms to this process since 2006. West Point’s mechanism for the Class of 2020 exacerbated challenges implementing Army policy aims. We formulate these desiderata as axioms and study their implications theoretically and with administrative data. We show that the Army’s objectives not only determine an allocation mechanism, but also a specific priority policy, a uniqueness result that integrates mechanism and priority design. These results led to a re-design of the mechanism, now adopted at both West Point and ROTC.</span>

                    <span>We document five novel facts about Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) deviations vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar for 34 currencies of advanced economies and emerging markets. First, the UIP premium co-moves with global risk aversion (VIX) for all currencies, whereas only for emerging market currencies there is a negative comovement between the UIP premium and capital inflows. Second, the comovement of the UIP premium and the VIX is explained by changes in interest rate differentials in emerging markets, and by expected changes in exchange rates in advanced countries. Third, country risk measured by the degree of policy uncertainty can explain both the negative comovement of the UIP premium with capital inflows and the positive comovement of the UIP premium with VIX going through interest rate differentials in emerging markets. Fourth, there are no overshooting and predictability reversal puzzles—for any currency—when using exchange rate expectations to calculate the UIP premium. Fifth, the classical Fama puzzle disappears in advanced economies in expectations, but it remains for emerging markets. As a result, while global investors expect zero excess returns and earn positive returns in the short-run and negative returns in the long-run by investing in advanced country currencies, the same global investors always expect and earn positive excess returns from emerging market currencies. These results imply that in advanced countries the UIP premium is largely due to deviations from rational expectations and full information, whereas in emerging markets, the UIP premium is a risk premium. Global investors charge an “excess” premium to compensate for policy uncertainty in emerging markets —a premium that is over and above the expected and actual depreciation of these currencies.</span>

                    <span>There are ongoing debates around the world over the value of private supplements to public health insurance systems. We investigate this issue in the context of one of the world’s deadliest diseases, diabetes, and one of the countries with the worst diabetes problems in the world, Mexico. We implement a novel deniers randomization approach to cost-effectively provide a causal estimate of enrollment in private supplement to the free public health system. Our final sample of more than 1000 diabetics randomized into a large price subsidy for enrollment in the private plan is well balanced. We estimate enormous impacts of the private supplement, with HbA1c blood sugar levels falling by a full point (relative to a control mean of 8.5%), and to increase the share of those treated who are under control by 69%. We show that this effect arises through both improved treatment compliance and health behaviors, and that diabetes complications fall even in the short run. The net costs of this intervention are at most one-third of the gross costs due to offsetting public sector savings, and the health benefits are many multiples of gross costs. But the returns to private care do not appear to reflect more productive delivery of care per visit, which is comparable in a separate quasi-experimental analysis of public insurance; rather, effects arise through more attachment to medical care in the private alternative.</span>

                    <span>Innovation policy can be a crucial component of governments&#x27; responses to crises. Because speed is a paramount objective, crisis innovation may also require different policy tools than innovation policy in non-crisis times, raising distinct questions and tradeoffs. In this paper, we survey the U.S. policy response to two crises where innovation was crucial to a resolution: World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. After providing an overview of the main elements of each of these efforts, we discuss how they compare, and to what degree their differences reflect the nature of the central innovation policy problems and the maturity of the U.S. innovation system. We then explore four key tradeoffs for crisis innovation policy---top-down vs. bottom-up priority setting, concentrated vs. distributed funding, patent policy, and managing disruptions to the innovation system---and provide a logic for policy choices. Finally, we describe the longer-run impacts of the World War II effort and use these lessons to speculate on the potential long-run effects of the COVID-19 crisis on innovation policy and the innovation system.</span>

                    <span>Employment rates of males aged 55-64 have changed dramatically in the OECD over the last 5 decades. The average employment rate decreased by more than 15 percentage points between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, only to increase by roughly the same amount subsequently. One proposed explanation in the literature is that spousal non-working times are complements and that older males are working longer as a result of secular increases in labor supply of older females. In the first part of this paper we present evidence against this explanation. We then offer a new narrative to understand the employment rate changes for older individuals. We argue that the dramatic U-shaped pattern for older male employment rates should be understood as reflecting a mean reverting low frequency shock to labor market opportunities for all workers in combination with temporary country specific policy responses that incentivized older individuals to withdraw from market work.</span>

                    <span>Recent theoretical and empirical work characterizes attention as a limited resource that decision-makers strategically allocate. There has been less research on the dynamic interdependence of attention: how paying attention now may affect performance later. In this paper, we exploit high-frequency data on decision-making by Major League Baseball umpires to examine this. We find that umpires not only apply greater effort to higher-stakes decisions, but also that effort applied to earlier decisions increases errors later. These findings are consistent with the umpire having a depletable ‘budget’ of attention. There is no such dynamic interdependence after breaks during the game (at the end of each inning) suggesting that even short rest periods can replenish attention budgets. We also find that an expectation of higher stakes future decisions leads to reduced attention to current decisions, consistent with forward-looking behavior by umpires aware of attention scarcity.</span>

                    <span>Applications for new businesses from the U.S. Census Bureau’s monthly and weekly Business Formation Statistics (BFS) fell substantially in the early stages of the pandemic but then surged in the second half of 2020. This surge has continued through May 2021. The pace of applications since mid-2020 is the highest on record (earliest data available is 2004). The large increase in applications is for both likely new employers and nonemployers. These patterns contrast sharply with those in the Great Recession when applications for likely new employer businesses and in turn actual startups of employer businesses declined sharply and persistently. The surge in new business applications has been uneven across sectors. Ten 3-digit NAICS industries account for 75% of the surge. Dominant industries include Nonstore Retail (alone accounting for 33% of the surge), Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, Truck Transportation, and Accommodation and Food Services. Given that existing small businesses in Retail Trade and Accommodation and Food Services have suffered especially large declines in the pandemic, these patterns are consistent with restructuring induced by the pandemic.</span>

                    <span>We provide a comprehensive overview of codetermination, i.e., worker representation in firms’ governance and management. We cover the institution’s history, implementation, and the best available evidence on its economic impacts. We argue that existing quasiexperimental estimates suggest that codetermination has zero or very small positive effects on worker and firm outcomes at the partial-equilibrium firm level. In addition, we test for general-equilibrium effects of codetermination laws using novel cross-country event studies exploiting a series of codetermination reforms between the 1960s and 2010s, and find no evidence that codetermination laws shift aggregate economic outcomes or the quality of industrial relations. We offer three potential explanations of the institution’s limited impact. First, existing codetermination laws convey relatively little authority to workers. Second, countries with codetermination laws have high baseline levels of informal worker involvement in decision-making, independently of formal codetermination. Third, codetermination laws may interact with other labor market institutions, such as union representation and collective bargaining. We close by discussing implications of these facts for recent codetermination proposals in the United States.</span>

The first is incentivized and is an online adaptation of the laboratory-based Niederle-Vesterlund measure. The second is an unincentivized survey question eliciting general competitiveness on an 11-point scale. Both measures are strong and consistent predictors of income, occupation, completed level of education and field of study. The predictive power of the new unincentivized measure for these outcomes is robust to controlling for other traits, including risk attitudes, confidence and the Big Five personality traits. For most outcomes, the predictive power of competitiveness exceeds that of the other traits. Gender differences in competitiveness can explain 5-10 percent of the observed gender differences in education and labor market outcomes.</span>

                    <span>This handbook chapter focuses on important interactions between the family and culture. We discuss the wide range of global variation in family institutions, variation which is in part sustained by cultural differences, and important recent changes in family structures. The chapter discusses why different family institutions arise, when they persist, and what forces may lead them to change. Furthermore, it examines changes in key family outcomes, such as the rise of female labor force participation, the decline in marriage, and the increase in divorce. These changes have been accompanied by and interact with cultural change. Finally, we show how cultural institutions related to the family, such as son preference, co-residence traditions, polygyny, and marriage payments, affect decision-making within the family and interact with policy. We conclude that studying the family in a vacuum, without accounting for the role of culture, may lead to misleading conclusions regarding the effects of policies, macroeconomic shocks, or technological change.</span>

We examine whether the 2016 election of Donald Trump, who made illegal immigration and border enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign, reduced illegal immigration into the U.S. We exploit the fact the election result was widely unexpected and thus generated a large, overnight change in expected immigration policy and rhetoric. We compare migration flows before and after the election and find that while it reduced immigration among deported Mexicans and at least temporarily among Central Americans, it had no effect on the overall inflow of unauthorized Mexican workers.</span>

                    <span>We document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the US wage structure over the last four decades are accounted for by the relative wage declines of worker groups specialized in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. We develop a conceptual framework where tasks across a number of industries are allocated to different types of labor and capital. Automation technologies expand the set of tasks performed by capital, displacing certain worker groups from employment opportunities for which they have comparative advantage. This framework yields a simple equation linking wage changes of a demographic group to the task displacement it experiences. We report robust evidence in favor of this relationship and show that regression models incorporating task displacement explain much of the changes in education differentials between 1980 and 2016. Our task displacement variable captures the effects of automation technologies (and to a lesser degree offshoring) rather than those of rising market power, markups or deunionization, which themselves do not appear to play a major role in US wage inequality. We also propose a methodology for evaluating the full general equilibrium effects of task displacement (which include induced changes in industry composition and ripple effects as tasks are reallocated across different groups). Our quantitative evaluation based on this methodology explains how major changes in wage inequality can go hand-in-hand with modest productivity gains.</span>

                    <span>Foreign currency derivative markets are among the largest in the world, yet their role in emerging markets is relatively understudied. We study firms&#x27; currency risk exposure and their hedging choices by employing a unique dataset covering the universe of FX derivatives transactions in Chile since 2005, together with firm-level information on sales, international trade, trade credits and foreign currency debt. We uncover four novel facts: (i) natural hedging of currency risk is limited, (ii) financial hedging is more likely to be used by larger firms and for larger amounts, (iii) firms in international trade are more likely to use FX derivatives to hedge their gross --not net-- cash currency risk, and (iv) firms are more likely to pay higher premiums for longer maturity contracts. We then show that financial intermediaries can affect the forward exchange rate market through a liquidity channel, by leveraging a regulatory negative supply shock that reduced firms&#x27; use of FX derivatives and increased the forward premiums.</span>

                    <span>The public discourse around pay transparency has focused on the direct effect: how workers seek to rectify newly-disclosed pay inequities through renegotiations. The question of how wage-setting and hiring practices of the firm respond in equilibrium has received less attention. To study these outcomes, we build a model of bargaining under incomplete information and test our predictions in the context of the U.S. private sector. Our model predicts that transparency reduces the individual bargaining power of workers, leading to lower average wages. A key insight is that employers credibly refuse to pay high wages to any one worker to avoid costly renegotiations with others under transparency. In situations where workers do not have individual bargaining power, such as under a collective bargaining agreement or in markets with posted wages, greater transparency has a muted impact on average wages. We test these predictions by evaluating the roll-out of U.S. state legislation protecting the right of workers to inquire about the salaries of their coworkers. Consistent with our prediction, the laws lead wages to decline by approximately 2% overall, but declines are progressively smaller in occupations with higher unionization rates. Our model provides a unified framework to analyze a wide range of transparency policies, and reconciles effects of transparency mandates documented in a variety of countries and contexts.</span>

                    <span>Do antitrust laws influence corporate valuations? We evaluate the relationship between firm value and laws limiting firms from engaging in anticompetitive agreements, abusing dominant positions, and conducting M&amp;As that restrict competition. Using firm-level data from 99 countries over the 1990-2010 period, we discover that valuations rise after countries strengthen competition laws. The effects are larger among firms with more severe pre-existing agency problems: firms in countries with weaker investor protection laws, with weaker firm-specific governance provisions, and with greater opacity. The results suggest that antitrust laws that intensify competition exert a positive influence on valuations by reducing agency problems.</span>

                    <span>Before the 2008 crisis, the cross-sectional skewness of banks’ leverage went up and macro risk concentrated in the balance sheets of large banks. Using a model of profit-maximizing banks with heterogeneous Value-at-Risk constraints, we extract the distribution of banks’ risk-taking parameters from balance sheet data. The time series of these estimates allow us to understand systemic risk and its concentration in the banking sector over time. Counterfactual exercises show that (1) monetary policymakers confront the trade-off between stimulating the economy and financial stability, and (2) macroprudential policies can be effective tools to increase financial stability.</span>

                    <span>The speed with which Covid-19 vaccines were developed and their high-performance underlines how much society depends on the pace of scientific research and how effective science can be. This is especially the case for vaccines based on the new designer mRNA technology. We draw on this exceptional moment for science to reflect on whether the government funding system is sufficiently supportive of research needed for key breakthroughs, and whether the system of funding encourages sufficient risk-taking to induce scientists to explore transformative research paths. We begin with a discussion of the challenges faced by scientists who did pioneering-research related to mRNA-based drugs in getting support for research. We describe measures developed to distinguish risky from non-risky research and their citation footprint. We review empirical work suggesting that funding is biased against risky research and provide a framework for thinking about why principal investigators, panelists and funding agencies may eschew risky research. We close with a discussion of interventions that government agencies and universities could follow if they wish to avoid a bias against risk.</span>

                    <span>We evaluate the aggregate effects of changes in trade barriers when these changes can be implemented slowly over time and trade responds gradually to changes in trade barriers because firm-level trade costs make exporting a dynamic decision. Our model shows how expectations of changes in trade barriers affect the economy. We find that while decreases in trade barriers increase economic activity, expectations of lower future trade barriers temporarily decrease investment, hours worked, and output. Further-more, canceling an expected decline in future trade barriers raises investment and output in the short run but substantially lowers medium-run growth. These effects are larger when the expected reform is bigger. In the data, we find that countries with more trade growth after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds decreased investment and hours worked in the years leading to the tariff cuts, as predicted by our model.</span>

                    <span>Compiling new liability-level data from the balance sheets of personal bankruptcy filers, we document that a sizable share of reported liabilities are “shadow debt,” debt not reported to credit bureaus that often arises from the non-payment of goods and services. We use this new data to evaluate how debtor cash flows affect when consumers file for bankruptcy and how much debt they have at bankruptcy. We find that filers respond to a quasi-exogenous $100 increase in monthly cash flows by delaying filing by an average of one month and by increasing unsecured indebtedness by $4,000 in the months preceding filing. A large share of the additional debt incurred by delaying filers is shadow debt, and our effects are concentrated among filers without employment, health, or marriage shocks.</span>

                    <span>Many price indices must be constructed without quantity data at the elementary level. We show that for some consumer goods in the United States and other countries, one can approximate expenditure shares using weights derived from the retail distribution of sellers. These weights are based on the share of outlets selling an item, or the share of outlets adjusted by the total number of items sold in each. Relative to using no weights, we find that using such imputed weights substantially reduces bias in the frequency of price changes, in annual inflation, and in price comparisons across countries.</span>

This column explores how banks’ credit market experiences affect their decisions and moral hazards in lending. Banks&#x27; prior experience with borrowing firms and co-lenders reinforces their monitoring incentives allowing for a smaller lead share in the lending syndicate. Banks&#x27; sectoral experience, in contrast, appears to dilute monitoring incentives, calling for a larger lead share in the lending syndicate.</span>

From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 are up 5 and DOW futures are up 36 (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $70.99 per barrel and Brent at $72.80 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $36, and Brent was at $39 - so WTI oil prices are UP almost double year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic).

Here are some comments from Merrill Lynch economists:
&quot;Based on the FOMC minutes and subsequent speeches, we think Fed Chair Powell will note that Fed officials talked about the path of asset purchases, but that they are still very comfortable with the current program. He will reiterate that it is “some time” before substantial further progress in the economy has been made to justify a change in asset purchases. And finally he will note that starting to discuss the path for asset purchases is consistent with the idea that the Fed wants to give an abundance of guidance about changes to the policy ...

                    <span>The evolution of altruism is an intensely studied phenomena in both the natural and social sciences. This column presents novel evidence from a large-scale survey conducted in August 2020 across nine European countries measuring how trust, reciprocity, and altruism are affected by economic interests, shared values, and a major health crisis. It finds that while altruism is enhanced by shared identities or crises, interpersonal trust is not. Common economic interests have little impact on altruism or reciprocity, suggesting that economic concerns alone cannot build social cohesion.</span>

                    <span>Although increased parental age has been a suspected risk factor for adverse offspring outcomes, the findings from the existing medical and epidemiological literature are mixed. The existing literature compares children with parents of different age across families, which is problematic because both parental age and birth defects may correlate with genetic variables and socioeconomic background. This column argues that when using a more appropriate methodology, comparing children within families – i.e. between siblings – there are strong and negative effects of parental ageing on offspring outcomes, with implications for public policy.</span>

                    <span>Note: Remember, sales were weak in April and May last year, so the year-over-year comparison is especially strong this month.  I&#x27;m tracking data for many local markets around the U.S.  I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.
From the GAMLS for Atlanta:
Total Residential Units Sold in May 2021 were 9,066, up 36.1% from 6,662 in May 2020.
Active Residential Listings in May 2021 were 7,530, down 61.1% from 19,352 in May 2020.  Inventory was up 8.1% from 6,964 last month.
Months of Supply was 0.86 Months in May 2021, compared to 2.53 Months in May 2020.

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of June 8th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Share of Borrowers in Forbearance Falls Below 4%, Lowest Since Onset of Pandemic
Forbearance volumes fell by 61,000 (-2.9%) from last week to this week, continuing the trend of early month declines in forbearance volumes. Declines were seen across all investor classes, with portfolio/PLS loans seeing the largest improvement (-33K), while FHA/VA (-19K) and GSE (-9k) forbearances also saw meaningful declines.
  
Plan starts did rise this week, following the Memorial Day-shortened week, but remain relatively low, considering. For the second week in a row, more than 100,000 homeowners left their forbearance plans, with roughly one-third of loan reviews for extension or removal resulting in removals.
  
Some 530,000 plans are still scheduled for quarterly reviews for extension/removal over the next three weeks, which could lead to additional plan exits as we near the July 4 holiday.

Fewer than 4% of all mortgage-holders are now in forbearance, the first time since the onset of the pandemic this number has fallen so low.
  
As of June 8, 2.06 million (3.9% of) homeowners remain in COVID-19-related forbearance plans, including 2.3% of GSE, 6.9% of FHA/VA and 4.4% of portfolio/PLS loans.

컴파일러 개발은 이론적으로도 복잡하고 엔지니어링적으로도 많은 노력이 필요하다 보니 대부분 다가가기를 꺼리게 되는 분야다. 그런데 컴파일러가 처음부터 복잡했던 것은 아니다. 컴퓨터 과학·공학의 연구·구현 성과가 쌓이기 전에는 단순하고 작은 언어와 그 컴파일러가 있었고 이런 것들은 만들어 보면서 컴파일러 개발을 익혔고 이 방법은 지금도 어느 정도는 유용하다. 이 책은 교육적 성격의 프로그래밍 언어인 PL/0′ 컴파일러를 개발하면서 컴파일러의 기본적인 이론과 구조, 구현의 기초를 배울 수 있게 안내한다.

                    <span>The trade-off between stability and growth has long been a subject of policy debate and informs views on the extent to which the supervision of banks should be centralised. This column presents analysis of the ECB’s Single Supervisory Mechanism, using the announcement of the mechanism and its implementation as a quasi-natural experiment. It finds that centralised bank supervision is associated with a decline in lending to firms, which is accompanied by a shift away from intangible investment and towards more cash holdings and higher investment in easily collateralisable physical assets.</span>

                    <span>Modest gender gaps emerge in primary school, with girls tending to perform better than boys in reading tests, for example, and less likely to experience disciplinary incidents that result in suspension. This column uses data from the US state of Florida to examine why these modest gaps translate into large gender differences in later educational attainment, such as completing secondary education and enrolling in and graduating from tertiary education. It finds that early childhood family environment has differential effects on boys, and particularly those at the lower tails of the academic test score and attendance distributions.</span>

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 14.0% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Occupancy Flat, but Reaches Pandemic Highs
U.S. weekly hotel performance remained relatively flat from the previous week but still reached pandemic-era highs, according to STR‘s latest data through June 5.
May 30 through June 5, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 61.9% (-14.0%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$123.49 (-6.7%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$76.44 (-19.7%)
 Each of the three key performance metrics were the highest of the pandemic era.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is now above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has leisure has been solid.

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.6 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in April, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.0 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending August 2008.
  
The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 7.3 percent in May. This increase accounted for about one-third of the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.4 percent in May, the same increase as in April. The energy index was unchanged in May, with a decline in the gasoline index again offsetting increases in the electricity and natural gas indexes. 
  
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7 percent in May after increasing 0.9 percent in April. Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, household furnishings and operations, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel. The index for medical care fell slightly, one of the few major component indexes to decline in May.
  
   The all items index rose 5.0 percent for the 12 months ending May; it has been trending up every month since January, when the 12-month change was 1.4 percent. The index for all items less food and energy rose 3.8 percent over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1992. The energy index rose 28.5 percent over the last 12-months, and the food index increased 2.2 percent.

코로나19 팬데믹은 전 세계 경제와 사회 질서 모두를 완벽하게 변화시켰다. 예상치 못한 바이러스의 출현은 사람들을 공포로 몰아넣었고 이는 즉각 경제지표로 나타났다. 실제로 대다수의 국가는 1930년대 대공황 이후 최악의 마이너스 성장률을 보였으며, 대규모 양적완화로 인한 부채 문제로 경제 주체 전체가 불안한 양상을 보였다. 이에 세계경제포럼은 2021년 공식 주제로 ‘그레이트 리셋’을 선정했다. 

말 그대로 지속 가능한 성장을 위해서는 경제와 사회뿐만 아니라 생각과 사고방식 모두 완전히 개조해야만 한다는 의미다. 현재 금융시장은 침체한 경기를 살리기 위해 막대한 재정과 통화정책으로 대응했고 그 결과 경기 회복의 신호가 포착되었다. 하지만 인플레이션과 금리 인상, 코로나 버블의 위험 등 경제를 뒤흔드는 위기의 신호 또한 곳곳에서 대두되고 있다. 

지난 9.11 테러 직전의 주가 폭락과 그 후의 반등, 2004년 5월의 주가 하락과 2005년 주가 상승 등의 시점을 정확하게 예측하며 한국의 닥터둠이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 이 책 『그레이트 리셋』을 통해 거시 경제의 흐름 속 다양한 지표를 근거로 코로나19 이후 펼쳐질 새로운 경제 적신호를 낱낱이 분석한다. 특히 부채에 의한 성장이 한계에 다다랐음을 강…</span>

사람들의 안목은 점점 높아지고 취향은 더욱더 까다로워지고 있다. ‘소유’보다 차별화된 ‘경험’에 가치를 두는 최근의 고객들을 만족시키기 위해서는 새로운 비즈니스 전략이 필요하다. 구독경제 강국인 일본 현지에서 활동하는 경영 컨설턴트이자, 리테일 및 라이프스타일 전문가인 저자는 구독 비즈니스 성공사례에서 그 해답을 찾는다. 

이 책에서는 소비 트렌드 및 기업환경의 변화를 분석해 구독경제가 성장하게 된 배경부터 구독 비즈니스의 본질과 특징, 운영 시 유의점까지 소비 트렌드의 중심에 선 구독경제의 모든 것을 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 국내외 구독 모델 성공 사례를 중심으로 구독 서비스가 제공하는 새로운 가치를 ‘큐레이션, 맞춤, 경험’이라는 세 가지 키워드로 소개한다.

특히 국내에서 쉽게 볼 수 있는 온라인 콘텐츠 등 무형의 구독 모델이 아닌, 재화 중심의 구독 서비스 사례를 선별한 것이 특징이다. 국내 구독경제 시장에서 재화 구독 서비스는 아직 초기 단계로 앞으로 성장할 여지가 더욱 크다.

이 책을 통해 의식주를 아우르는 모든 영역에서 독자들의 라이프스타일을 한 단계 업그레이드하는 색다른 경험을 선사하며, 새로운 비즈니스 기회 속에서 분명한 브랜드 전략과 인사이트를 제공해줄 구독경제의 이야기를 만나보자.

                    <span>In December 1990, the Soviet Union withdrew from its bilateral trade agreement with Finland. This was followed by a dramatic collapse in Finnish-Soviet trade and a deep economic crisis in Finland. This column re-assesses the role of the trade collapse in causing the Finnish Great Depression in the early 1990s. The trade shock had a strong negative effect on the Finnish economy but explains less than one-third of the cumulative GDP loss. Domestic factors, including a financial boom and bust, exerted a much larger negative effect.</span>

                    <span>Fiscal rules were enshrined in the founding documents of the European Monetary Union. This column presents the latest CfM-CEPR survey, in which the panel of experts on the European economy were nearly unanimous in agreeing that the existing EU fiscal rules require revision. Most panel members would opt for some combination of fiscal councils; more flexible, countercyclical, or expenditure-based rules; and increased fiscal capacity at the EU level. A smaller share of panelists would scrap fiscal rules altogether, leave fiscal policy to national authorities, and provide greater clarity that the EU would not bail out countries facing debt problems. A single panel member called for stricter rules with greater enforcement.</span>

                    <span>Financial sanctions against Russia’s state-owned and controlled banks were imposed consecutively between 2014 and 2019, allowing banks that would potentially be targeted in the future to adjust their international and domestic exposures. This column explores the informational effects of financial sanctions, showing thatcompared to similar private banks, ‘not yet sanctioned’ financial institutions immediately reduced their foreign assets while, rather unexpectedly, expanding their foreign liabilities. These informational effects crucially depend on geography, with targeted banks located further from Moscow decreasing their foreign assets by more and raising foreign liabilities by less than those located near the Kremlin.</span>

From the HAR: Houston Housing Blazes Its Way Through Uncharted Territory in May
Houston area home sales set new records in May as consumers took advantage of historically low interest rates in snapping up an ever-dwindling supply of properties for sale. What resulted was a nearly 50 percent jump in sales volume compared to the same month last year, when real estate was still in the process of recovering from coronavirus-related lockdown orders. Limited supply, strong buyer demand and increased construction costs all contributed to record high home prices.

                    <span>Demographics are very useful in predicting housing trends.

It was 11 years ago that we started discussing the turnaround for apartments.  Then, in January 2011, I attended the NMHC Apartment Strategies Conference in Palm Springs, and the atmosphere was very positive. 

On demographics, in 2010, a large cohort had been moving into the 20 to 29 year old age group (a key age group for renters).


As I noted in 2015, in the 2020s, a large cohort would be moving into the 30 to 39 age group (a key for ownership).   That is happening now.

NOTE: This graph uses the Vintage 2019 estimates.  There are questions about these estimates, and we will have much better data when the 2020 Decennial Census data is released.

                    <span>Worldwide merchandise trade flows decreased significantly in 2020, as Covid-19 disrupted economic activity across the globe. This column analyses how various pandemic-related factors shaped international trade flows. Specifically, it estimates how Covid-19 incidence and lockdown restrictions affected the monthly year-over-year growth of imports from China for all destinations to which China exported goods in 2019–2020. It finds that government measures to curb economic activities had a larger impact on a country’s imports than the direct health and behavioural effects of the pandemic itself.</span>

                    <span>Since the financial crisis, stress tests have become an important supervisory and financial stability tool. Relying on confidential data available at the ECB, this column presents novel evidence that supervisory scrutiny associated with stress testing has a disciplining effect on bank risk. Banks that participated in the 2016 EU-wide stress test subsequently reduced their credit risk relative to banks that were not part of this exercise. Relying on new metrics for supervisory scrutiny, it also shows that the disciplining effect is stronger for banks subject to more intrusive supervisory scrutiny during the stress test.</span>

The Las Vegas Realtors reported Southern Nevada home prices reach new heights while supply stays low; LVR housing statistics for May 2021
 A report released Tuesday by Las Vegas REALTORS® (LVR) shows local home prices continuing to reach new heights while the local housing supply remains near historically low levels.
...
LVR reported a total of 4,100 existing local homes, condos and townhomes sold during May. Compared to the same time last year, May sales were up 87.3% for homes and up 144.9% for condos and townhomes. So far this year, local home sales are on pace to exceed last year’s total.
…By the end of May, LVR reported 2,031 single-family homes listed for sale without any sort of offer. Although down 65.0% from the same time last year, Martinez noted the number of homes listed without offers actually increased for the third straight month. For condos and townhomes, the 529 properties listed without offers in May were slightly more than were listed during the previous month, though that inventory is still down 70.1% from the same time last year.
...
With eviction and foreclosure bans still in place, the number of so-called distressed sales remains near historically low levels. LVR reported that short sales and foreclosures combined accounted for just 0.7% of all existing local property sales in May. That compares to 1.5% of all sales one year ago, 2.0% of all sales two years ago, 2.6% three years ago and 6.8% four years ago. Martinez suggested that these percentages may rise slightly when government moratoriums are lifted.
emphasis added
1) Overall sales (single family and condos) were up 97.6% year-over-year from 2,075 in May 2020 to 4,100 in May 2021.
2) Active inventory (single-family and condos) is down 66.2% from a year ago, from a total of 7,815 in May 2020 to 2,560 in May 2021.  And months of inventory is extremely low.
3) Active inventory is up 9.1% from the previous month (April 2021).</span>

                    <span>From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings reached a series high of 9.3 million on the last business day of April, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires were little changed at 6.1 million. Total  separations increased to 5.8 million. Within separations, the quits rate reached a series high of 2.7  percent while the layoffs and discharges rate decreased to a series low of 1.0 percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for April, the most recent employment report was for May.
 Click on graph for larger image.
Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spikes in layoffs and discharges in March and April 2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings increased in April to 9.286 million from 8.288 million in March.  This is a new record high for this series.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 100% year-over-year.  This is a comparison to the worst of the pandemic.
Quits were up 88% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for &quot;quits&quot;).  This is a record high for Quits too.</span>

Exports increased and imports decreased in April. 
Exports are up 36.6% compared to April 2020; imports are up 34.9% compared to April 2020.
Both imports and exports decreased sharply due to COVID-19, and have now bounced back (imports much more than exports),
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit, with and without petroleum.
 The blue line is the total deficit, and the black line is the petroleum deficit, and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products.

기업의 사회적 임무를 기반으로 한 경영 설계 전문가로 『주식회사 이데올로기』, 『그들은 왜 회사의 주인이 되었나』를 쓴 마저리 켈리가, 지역 경제 모델 전문가 테드 하워드와 함께 자본주의의 원칙을 바꾸는 &#x27;희망&#x27;의 로드맵을 펼쳐 보인다. 두 저자는 지구와 문명이 어떤 운명의 길을 걸을지 걱정하는 이들을 위해 『모두를 위한 경제』를 썼다. 지금 막 형성되고 있는 새로운 경제 시스템을 생생하게 나누기 위해서다.

켈리와 하워드는 미국에서 가장 가난하고 쇠락한 도시 클리블랜드에 뿌리 박고 지역 경제를 소생시킨 사람들, 참담하리만치 빈곤한 인디언 보호구역에서 자활 공동체를 지은 아메리카 원주민들, 각종 혜택에서 배제된 유색 인종과 여성에게 창업 기회를 만들어준 포틀랜드 기관, 지역을 이끌던 공단이 문 닫고 30년이 지나면서 가족도 이웃도 무너진 영국 프레스턴에 다시 피가 돌게 만든 사람들과 동행한다. 

중앙에서 너무 멀리 떨어진 곳에 방치된 이들은 정부나 대기업에 의지할 수 없다는 것을 깨닫고 기대를 버렸다. 그리고 해법을 찾기 위해 스스로 일어났다. 지역에서 떠날 수도 없고, 누구보다 터전을 지키고 싶었던 사람들이 마침내 실험을 시작했다.

국내 최고의 이코노미스트 홍춘욱 박사가 돈 공부만 28년 한 모든 노하우를 담아 경제 흐름과 부동산, 주식, 투자에 필요한 현실적인 조언, 즉 돈의 흐름을 읽는 법을 담았다. 돈의 주도권을 잡기 위해서 우리는 반드시 돈의 흐름을 읽는 법을 알아야 한다. 홍춘욱 박사는 아들에게 물려줄 부의 유산으로 ‘돈의 흐름을 읽는 법’을 꼽았고, 홍 박사가 가진 돈에 관한 인사이트를 집대성해 불확실한 시대에 나를 지키는 현실적인 투자 방법을 알려주고 있다. 

은행과 증권사의 이코노미스트로, 국민연금공단의 투자 운용 매니저로, 경제·경영학자로 탄탄히 쌓아 올린 저자의 투자 이력은 불확실성이 큰 요즘 같은 코로나 및 저금리 시대에 어떤 길로 나가야 할지 선명한 방향을 제시해준다. 

특히 우리 삶에 큰 영향을 끼치고 있음에도 잘 알지 못하는 세 가지 금융 변수인 ‘금리, 주가, 환율’에 대한 저자의 관록 있는 분석은 경제 흐름을 파악하는 데 많은 도움을 준다. 대중을 위한 경제 해설가로서 최신의 경제 데이터와 이슈가 되는 핵심 쟁점을 놓치지 않고, 실제 세상과 돈에 관한 정보를 통찰력 있게 담아낸 것이 이 책의 가장 큰 특징이다.

파이썬을 배웠는데 그 다음엔 뭘 할 수 있지? 라는 물음에서부터 기획되었다. 인간의 언어도 사용해봐야 늘 듯이, 프로그래밍 언어도 그렇다. 문법만 배웠다고 자유자재로 말할 수는 없지 않은가? 하지만, 단순하고 재미없는 예제들만 따라하며 배우라고 하면 배움의 길은 고단할 것이다. 그래서 이 책은 누구나 공감할 수 있는 생활밀착형 프로젝트 11개를 직접 구현해보면서 재미와 실력 두 가지를 함께 잡을 수 있도록 구성했다.

                    <span>To what extent do households self-insure to avoid cutting back on consumption following income losses, and which self-insurance channels are most important? This column reviews evidence on household responses to job loss using comprehensive high-frequency data from multiple sources in Denmark. Over the two years following job loss, 30% of the decline in disposable income is accounted for by a drop in household spending, leaving a gap of 70% that reflects the effects of self-insurance. This gap is filled by lower accumulation of liquid assets (~50%), increases in private transfers and other inflows (~10%), higher spousal labour supply (~5%), and lower net debt repayments (~5%). Mortgage borrowing and refinancing play only a small role.</span>

                    <span>Remember - sales slumped in April and May 2020, so the year-over-year sales comparisons are crazy.
The Northwest Multiple Listing Service reported May marked a month of new records for some Northwest MLS market indicators
May was a month of record-setting highs and lows for some key housing market indicators tracked by Northwest Multiple Listing Service.
  
Northwest MLS director Robb Wasser, branch manager at Windermere Real Estate/East in Bellevue, noted the number of active listings for single family homes dropped from April to May for the first time in at least 20 years. The month-to-month decline was small (only 83 listings), but compared to 12 months ago, May&#x27;s inventory plummeted by 4,824 listings (down 46.6%).
  
Months of inventory of homes and condominiums fell to just over two weeks (0.59 months) system-wide, which encompasses 26 of Washington&#x27;s 39 counties. Only March 2021 and December 2020 have been lower when both months ended with only 0.53 months of supply.
  
Year-over-year price increases measured by percentages appeared to hit a new high with the median price on last month&#x27;s 9,374 closed sales soaring 30% from a year ago.
emphasis added
The press release is for the Northwest MLS area.  There were 9,374 closed sales in May 2021, up 57.4% from 5,957 sales in May 2020.  Active inventory for the Northwest is down 46.6%.
In King County, sales were up 83.3% year-over-year, and active inventory was down 42.5% year-over-year.
In Seattle, sales were up 104.5% year-over-year, and inventory was down 16.9% year-over-year. (inventory in Seattle was extremely low last year).  This puts the months-of-supply in Seattle at just 0.85 months.</span>

As of June 4th, inventory was at 329 thousand (7 day average), compared to 706 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 53.3%.


A week ago, inventory was at 327 thousand, and was down 54.5% YoY.  Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.  


Inventory was about 7.5% above the low in early April.

베이지안 통계분석에 대한 직관적인 소개로 시작해서 선형회귀모형 추정을 통해 기초적인 베이지안 분석 기법인 깁스 샘플링을 구체적으로 설명하는 책이다. 그런 다음, 가장 일반적이고 표준적인 추정방법인 MetropolisHastings(MH) 샘플링을 설명하고, 구조변화모형, 프라빗,구조 VAR, 마코프스위칭, 상태공간, GARCH, 확률적 변동성 모형 등 여러 계량경제학 모형 추정 과정을 실제 사례와 함께 구체적으로 소개한다.

더불어 모형선택 방법과 추정의 효율성을 측정하거나 표본 외 예측력을 평가하는 방법들에 대해서도 기술하였다. 개정판에는 최근 빅데이터 분석기법에 대한 수요를 반영해서 혼합 분포 모형을 이용한 군집분석과 베이지안 변수선택 기법을 추가하였고, MH를 통한 주변 우도 함수 계산법도 새롭게 소개하였다.

                    <span>We view sustainability as a requirement that welfare should not be expected to decline over time. We impose this requirement as a prior constraint on the consumption-savings-investment problem, and study its implications for saving, risky investment, and the social discount rate. The constraint does not distort portfolio choice, but it imposes an upper bound on the sustainable time preference rate and on the sustainable consumption-wealth ratio, which we show must lie between the riskless rate and the expected return on optimally invested wealth.</span>

                    <span>Low response rates among rich households are thought to be a serious problem in many applications using household surveys. The paper discusses the various ways the problem can be dealt with, and makes some recommendations for practice, including in developing countries. Under certain conditions, income-selective non-compliance with an initially randomized assignment can be corrected by reweighting the data. This requires that the surveys pick up at least some top incomes. If not, then income tax records can help, including in estimating distributional national accounts. However, tax data come with their own concerns including tax avoidance/evasion, weak coverage of informal sectors and illicit incomes, and concerns about construct validity, given the limitations of taxable income as a basis for inter-personal comparisons of economic welfare. An appropriately weighted survey-based distribution of an acceptable measure of economic welfare need not be less reliable for most purposes of distributional analysis than income-tax records, including in combination with surveys. The choice will depend on the question to be addressed, and country-specific circumstances. These measurement issues warrant further research across multiple settings.</span>

We find that Democratic CEOs (those who contribute more to Democratic candidates) are associated with higher representation of women in the executive suite. To explore causality, we use an event study approach and show that replacing a Republican with a Democratic CEO is associated with 20%-60% in more women in the executive suite. Finally, we show that Democratic CEOs associated with a significant reduction (or even disappearance) of the gender gap in the level and performance-sensitivity of executive pay.</span>

                    <span>Mortgage cramdown enabled bankruptcy judges to discharge the underwater portion of a mortgage during Chapter 13 bankruptcy before the Supreme Court disallowed this practice in 1993. We exploit the random assignment of cases to judges to quantify the ex-post effects of Chapter 13 bankruptcy over the period from 1989 to 1993. We find that a successful Chapter 13 filing in a cramdown court substantially decreases the five-year foreclosure rate, the propensity to move, and the crime rate. Our results suggest that principal write-down considerably reduces homeowner’s distress.</span>

Using linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings with a regression discontinuity design, we find robust evidence that work requirements increase program exits by 23 percentage points (64 percent) among incumbent participants after 18 months. There is a 53 percent overall reduction in program participation among adults who are subject to work requirements. Homeless adults are disproportionately screened out. We find no effects on employment, and suggestive evidence of increased earnings in some specifications. Our findings indicate that, per dollar of public expenditure, eliminating work requirements would likely transfer more resources to low-income adults than other programs targeting the same population.</span>

                    <span>Individuals who engage in “judging” – that is, rendering a determination in a dispute or contest between two parties – might be influenced by public pressure to favor one of the parties. Many rules and arrangements seek to insulate such individuals from public pressure or to address the effects of such pressure. We study this subject empirically, investigating the circumstances in which public pressure is more and less likely to affect judging.
Using detailed data from the Bundesliga, Germany’s top soccer league, our analysis of how crowd pressure affects the decisions of referees yields two key insights.

                    <span>Food manufacturing and processing is an important link between agricultural producers and consumers in the agricultural supply chain. The food manufacturing sector in the United States is both increasingly mechanized and increasingly concentrated. Consequently, labor risks in food manufacturing have changed over time with changes in industry structure. Labor risks were highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic - particularly in the animal slaughtering and processing industry - where labor-driven disruptions resulted in temporary plant closures. We use county-level data on employment in food manufacturing and dynamic panel models estimated via generalized method of moments to examine employment and wage dynamics in the food manufacturing sector and animal processing industry. We then compare forecasts from the estimated models with changes in food manufacturing and animal processing employment and wages during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results provide insight into the role of operational and disruption risks in food manufacturing. We find significant delays in adjustment to employment and quicker adjustment in wages. Although there is an unanticipated drop in employment in food manufacturing and animal processing in April of 2020, employment returned to predicted levels within two to three months. The response of wages and employment to the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a degree of resilience in food supply chains.</span>

                    <span>We study the role of global financial intermediaries in international lending. We construct a model of the world economy, in which heterogeneous borrowers issue risky securities purchased by financial intermediaries. Aggregate shocks transmit internationally through financial intermediaries&#x27; net worth. The strength of this transmission is governed by the degree of frictions intermediaries face in financing their risky investments. We provide direct empirical evidence on this mechanism showing that around Lehman Brothers&#x27; collapse, emerging-market bonds held by more distressed global banks experienced larger price contractions. A quantitative analysis of the model shows that global financial intermediaries play a relevant role in driving borrowing-cost and consumption fluctuations in emerging-market economies, during both debt crises and regular business cycles. The portfolio of financial intermediaries and the distribution of bond holdings in the world economy are key to determine aggregate dynamics.</span>

                    <span>This paper uses new household survey data to study expectation formation during the recent housing boom in Germany. The cross section of forecasts depends on only two household characteristics: location and tenure. The average household in a region responds to local conditions but underpredicts local price growth. Renters make on average higher and hence more accurate forecasts than owners, although their forecasts are more dispersed and their mean squared forecast errors are higher. A quantitative model of learning about housing cost can match these facts. It emphasizes the unique information structure of housing among asset markets: renters who do not own the asset are relatively well informed about its cash flow, since they pay for housing services that owners simply consume. Renters then make more accurate forecasts in a boom driven by an increase in rents and recovery from a financial crisis.</span>

                    <span>We develop and calibrate a life-cycle model of labor supply and consumption to quantify the implications of alternative pension reforms on labor supply, individual welfare, and government budget for China’s basic old-age insurance program. We focus on urban males and distinguish low-skilled and high-skilled individuals, who differ in their preferences, health and labor income dynamics, and medical expense processes. We use the calibrated model to evaluate three potential pension reforms: (i) increasing the pension eligibility age from 60 to 65, but keeping the current pension benefit rule unchanged; (ii) keeping the pension eligibility age at 60, but proportionally lowering pension benefits so that the pension program’s budget is the same as under Reform (i); and (iii) increasing the pension eligibility age to 65 and simultaneously increasing the pension benefits so that individuals of both skill types attain the same individual welfare levels as in the status quo. We find that relative to the baseline, both Reforms (i) and (ii) can substantially improve the budgets of the pension system, but at the cost of substantial individual welfare loss for both skill types. In contrast, we find that Reform (iii) can modestly improve the budget of the pension system while ensuring that both skill types are as well off as in the status quo. We find that Reforms (i) and (ii) slightly increases, but Reform (iii) slightly decreases, the overall labor supply.</span>

                    <span>Many models from epidemiology are not designed to capture tradeoffs between health and economic well-being and few are equipped to predict how these tradeoffs interact with individuals’ preferences to influence behavior. Policies based on such models may not reflect societal preferences or capture how preferences affect behavior and disease spread. Models with epidemiological processes that do incorporate behavior change or health-wealth tradeoffs (mostly from economics) drastically limit individual-level heterogeneity to remain tractable. This makes it difficult to understand variation in behavioral responses and distributional consequences of the pandemic, which should be central to any evaluation of pandemic-related policy. Without the proper tools, we are unable to fully address even basic policy questions, such as whether the long-run effects of social-distancing justify the costs - and if so, for whom and under what circumstances. After reviewing modeling approaches from epidemiology and economics (among other fields), I propose a framework adapted from earlier work on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Analysis of individual behavior is based on the idea that health is a form of human capital in which individuals invest through their choices. The model integrates individual level variation that other frameworks omit, but does so at the cost of drastically limiting aggregate economic and epidemiological processes. I conclude that what is needed is a multi-disciplinary effort that helps to bridge gaps across disciplines, which would amount to constructing models that capture key features of different approaches. To be useful in evaluating pandemic-related policy, such a model should have rich heterogeneity and capture how individual choices are linked to the broad contours of disease spread and aggregate economic output. Whether such an effort would be feasible and fruitful remains to be seen.</span>

The analysis introduces the green interest rate (rg) which depends on temporal changes in the pollution intensity of output. This policy instrument reallocates consumption from periods when output is pollution intensive to when output is cleaner. In economies on a cleaning-up path, rg exceeds r*. For those growing more polluted, rg is less than r*. In the U.S. economy from 1957 to 2016, rg exceeded r* by 50 basis points. Federal environmental policy reversed the orientation between rg and r*.</span>

We characterize how the optimal leverage regulation responds to arbitrary changes in investors&#x27; and creditors&#x27; beliefs and relate our results to practical scenarios. We show that the optimal regulation depends on the type and magnitude of such changes. Optimism by investors calls for looser leverage regulation, while optimism by creditors, or jointly by both investors and creditors, calls for tighter leverage regulation. Monetary policy should be tightened (loosened) in response to either investors&#x27; or creditors&#x27; optimism (pessimism).</span>

                    <span>Regulatory review of new medicines is often viewed as a hindrance to innovation by increasing the hurdle to bring products to market. However, a more complete accounting of regulation must also account for its potential market expanding effects through quality certification. We combine data on FDA approvals for follow-on indications and patient-level data on utilization, and examine whether FDA approval of a follow-on indication increases the use of a drug for that indication. We find 5 facts for the market-expanding role of regulation: (1) follow-on approvals increase the share of patients taking a drug with that indication by 4.1 percentage points, or 40% increase over baseline use, at the time of approval; (2) there is little market learning prior to or following the approval of the follow-on indication, suggesting that such approvals fully certify the new use;  (3) the effect of these approvals is larger for uses in a different disease area than previous indications, an increase equivalent to over 4 � years of market-learning; (4) it is FDA approval, not the initiation of clinical trials that generate the expansion in market size; (5) the market expansion is consistent with physicians prescribing the medicines more because of higher perceived benefits, not reduced administrative costs.</span>

                    <span>Staggered adoption of policies by different units at different times creates promising opportunities for observational causal inference. Estimation remains challenging, however, and common regression methods can give misleading results. A promising alternative is the synthetic control method (SCM), which finds a weighted average of control units that closely balances the treated unit’s pre-treatment outcomes. In this paper, we generalize SCM, originally designed to study a single treated unit, to the staggered adoption setting. We first bound the error for the average effect and show that it depends on both the imbalance for each treated unit separately and the imbalance for the average of the treated units. We then propose &quot;partially pooled&quot; SCM weights to minimize a weighted combination of these measures; approaches that focus only on balancing one of the two components can lead to bias. We extend this approach to incorporate unit-level intercept shifts and auxiliary covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed method via extensive simulations and apply our results to the question of whether teacher collective bargaining leads to higher school spending, finding minimal impacts. We implement the proposed method in the augsynth R package.</span>

                    <span>Using data from a prominent online platform for launching new digital products, we document that the composition of the platform&#x27;s ‘beta testers’ on the day a new product is launched has a systematic and persistent impact on the venture&#x27;s success. Specifically, we use word embedding methods to classify products on this platform as more or less focused on the needs of female customers. We then show that female-focused products launched on a typical day – when nine in ten users on the platform are men – experience 45% less growth in the year after launch. By isolating exogenous variation in the composition of beta testers unrelated to the characteristics of launched products on that day, we find that on days when there are unexpectedly more women, this gender-product gap shrinks towards zero. Further, consistent with a sampling bias mechanism, we find that the composition of beta testers appears to impact VC decision making and the entrepreneur&#x27;s subsequent product development efforts. Overall, our findings suggest that the composition of early users can induce systematic biases in the signals of startup potential, with consequential effects – including a shortage of innovations aimed at consumers who are underrepresented among early users.</span>

                    <span>We estimate the effect of patent protection on follow-on investments in corporate scientific research. We exploit a new method for identifying an exogenous reduction in the protection a granted patent provides. Using data on public, research-active firms between 1990 and 2015, we find that firms decrease follow-on research after a reduction in patent protection, as measured by a drop in internal citations to an associated scientific article. This effect is stronger for smaller firms and in industries where patents are traded less frequently. Our findings are consistent with a stylized model whereby patent protection is a strategic substitute for commercialization capability. Our results imply that stronger patents encourage follow-on research, but also shift the locus of research from big firms toward smaller firms and startups. As patent protection has strengthened since the mid-1980s, our results help explain why the American innovation ecosystem has undergone a growing division of innovative labor, where startups become primary sources of new ideas.</span>

                    <span>The synthetic control method (SCM) is a popular approach for estimating the impact of a treatment on a single unit in panel data settings. The &quot;synthetic control&quot; is a weighted average of control units that balances the treated unit&#x27;s pre-treatment outcomes and other covariates as closely as possible. A critical feature of the original proposal is to use SCM only when the fit on pre-treatment outcomes is excellent. We propose Augmented SCM as an extension of SCM to settings where such pre-treatment fit is infeasible. Analogous to bias correction for inexact matching, Augmented SCM uses an outcome model to estimate the bias due to imperfect pre-treatment fit and then de-biases the original SCM estimate. Our main proposal, which uses ridge regression as the outcome model, directly controls pre-treatment fit while minimizing extrapolation from the convex hull. This estimator can also be expressed as a solution to a modified synthetic controls problem that allows negative weights on some donor units. We bound the estimation error of this approach under different data generating processes, including a linear factor model, and show how regularization helps to avoid over-fitting to noise. We demonstrate gains from Augmented SCM with extensive simulation studies and apply this framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 Kansas tax cuts on economic growth. We implement the proposed method in the new augsynth R package.</span>

                    <span>We present a model of online content sharing where agents sequentially observe an article and must decide whether to share it with others. The article may contain misinformation, but at a cost, agents can fact-check it to determine whether its content is entirely accurate. While agents derive value from future shares, they simultaneously fear getting caught sharing misinformation. With little homophily in the “sharing network”, misinformation is often quickly identified and brought to an end. However, when homophily is strong, so that agents anticipate that only those with similar beliefs will view the article, misinformation spreads more rapidly because of echo chambers. We show that a social media platform that wishes to maximize content engagement will propagate extreme articles amongst the most extremist users, while not showing these articles to ideologically opposed users. This creates an endogenous echo chamber—filter bubble—that makes misinformation spread virally. We use this framework to understand how regulation can encourage more fact-checking by online users and mitigate the consequences of filter bubbles.</span>

                    <span>We build a novel equilibrium model in which households&#x27; labor supply choices form the link between sorting on the marriage market and sorting on the labor market. We first show that in theory, the nature of home production – whether partners&#x27; hours are complements or substitutes – shapes marriage market sorting, labor market sorting and labor supply choices in equilibrium. We then estimate our model on German data to assess the nature of home production in the data, and find that spouses&#x27; home hours are complements. We investigate to what extent complementarity in home hours drives sorting and inequality. We find that the home production complementarity – by strengthening positive marriage sorting and reducing the gender gap in hours and labor sorting – puts significant downward pressure on the gender wage gap and within-household income inequality, but it fuels between-household inequality. Our estimated model sheds new light on the sources of inequality in today&#x27;s Germany and – by identifying important shifts in home production technology towards more complementarity – on the evolution of inequality over time.</span>

                    <span>Digital platforms are not only match-making intermediaries but also establish internal rules that govern all users in their ecosystems. To better understand the governing role of platforms, we study two Airbnb pro-guest rules that pertain to guest and host cancellations, using data on Airbnb and VRBO listings in 10 US cities. We demonstrate that such pro-guest rules can drive demand and supply to and from the platform, as a function of the local platform competition between Airbnb and VRBO. Our results suggest that platform competition sometimes dampens a platform wide pro-guest rule and sometimes reinforces it, often with heterogeneous effects on different hosts. This implies that platform competition does not necessarily mitigate a platform&#x27;s incentive to treat the two sides asymmetrically, and any public policy in platform competition must consider its implication on all sides.</span>

                    <span>A long-standing issue in the theory of monetary policy is that the same path for the interest rate can be associated with multiple bounded equilibrium paths for inflation and output. We show that a small friction in memory and intertemporal coordination can remove this indeterminacy. This leaves no space for equilibrium selection by means of either the Taylor Principle or the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. It reinforces the logical foundations of the New Keynesian model’s conventional solution (a.k.a. its fundamental or MSV solution). And it liberates feedback rules to serve only one function: stabilization.</span>

                    <span>The research described here asks whether integration can change gender attitudes even in a traditionally male-dominated environment. One reason to ask this question is that occupational gender segregation remains high, even though women make up nearly half the labor force in most rich countries (Blau et al. 2013). This pattern may reflect preferences that differ […]

                    <span>Relatively little is known about the patterns of inequality in developing countries, despite their importance for designing social and economic policies. This column analyses administrative and household data to describe the trends in earnings inequality and dynamics in Brazil since late 1980s. The findings suggest that the observed fall in earnings inequality and volatility may have been driven by the process of formalisation and other changes within the informal sector.</span>

Monday:
• No major economic releases scheduled.
From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 and DOW futures are up slightly (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $69.66 per barrel and Brent at $71.89 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $39, and Brent was at $41 - so WTI oil prices are UP almost 75% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic). 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.05 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.02 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.03 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>The following graph shows heavy truck sales since 1967 using data from the BEA. The dashed line is the May 2021 seasonally adjusted annual sales rate (SAAR).
Heavy truck sales really collapsed during the great recession, falling to a low of 180 thousand SAAR in May 2009.  Then heavy truck sales increased to a new all time high of 563 thousand SAAR in September 2019.
However heavy truck sales started declining in late 2019 due to lower oil prices.
Note: &quot;Heavy trucks - trucks more than 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.&quot;

Heavy truck sales really declined at the beginning of the pandemic, falling to a low of 299 thousand SAAR in May 2020.  

Since then, sales have rebounded to near record highs.
Heavy truck sales were at 553 thousand SAAR in May, up from 473 thousand SAAR in April, and up 85% from 299 thousand SAAR in May 2020.</span>

The results show that children age-eligible for Head Start went on to achieve substantially higher levels of education. Head Start also led to improvements in adult economic self-sufficiency.

                    <span>Global food security is being threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictive measures to control it. Jammed food supply chains, falling incomes for some population segments, and rising food prices are placing food out of reach for millions of individuals. This column discusses the short-run relationship between food (in)security and income and food prices, and the implications of the current economic crisis for global hunger. The pandemic’s economic fallout risks setting us back a full decade on eliminating undernourishment, especially in low-income countries. Governments should strengthen social safety nets for the most vulnerable to keep inequality in check.</span>

Meanwhile, intermodal averaged 287,956 originated containers and trailers per week in May 2021. That’s down a bit from April — when the weekly average of 293,488 set a new all-time record — but it’s still the seventh most for any month in history and by far the most ever for May.

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 4.2% compared to the same week in 2019 (skewed by timing of Memorial Day), but the 4-week average is still down significantly compared to normal.

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Occupancy Reaches Highest Level Since Late-February 2020
Boosted by the Friday and Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, U.S. weekly hotel occupancy reached its highest level since late-February 2020, according to STR‘s latest data through 29 May.
23-29 May 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 61.8% (-4.2%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$122.06 (-1.6%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$75.42 (-5.7%)
 Percentage changes were skewed more to the positive because the 2019 comparable was the week after Memorial Day. Regardless, this past Saturday’s 83.0% occupancy level was the country’s highest since October 2019. Weekly ADR and RevPAR were boosted to pandemic-era highs as well. STR analysts note that while the positives around leisure demand are obvious headed into the summer, the path to recovery remains a rollercoaster with a lack of business travel, both domestic and international, preventing hotels in many markets from making up more of the ground lost in 2020.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is now above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has leisure has been solid.

Leisure and hospitality gained 292 thousand jobs.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 2.54 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back almost 70% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment declined 20 thousand in May, and State and Local education added 103 thousand jobs.  Manufacturing added 23 thousand jobs.

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 559,000 in May, and the unemployment rate  declined by 0.3 percentage point to 5.8 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in public and  private education, and in health care and social assistance.
...
The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised up by 15,000, from +770,000 to +785,000, and the change for April was revised up by 12,000, from +266,000 to +278,000. With these revisions, employment in March and April combined is 27,000 higher  than previously reported.

The first graph shows the year-over-year change in total non-farm employment since 1968.
In May, the year-over-year change was 11.900 million jobs.  This was up significantly - since employment collapsed in April 2020.
Total payrolls increased by 559 thousand in May.  Private payrolls increased by 492 thousand.
Payrolls for March and April were revised up 27 thousand, combined.
The second graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but currently is not as severe as the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.
The third graph shows the employment population ratio and the participation rate.
The Labor Force Participation Rate decreased to 61.6% in May, from 61.7% in April. This is the percentage of the working age population in the labor force. 
The Employment-Population ratio increased to 58.0% from 57.9% (black line).
I&#x27;ll post the 25 to 54 age group employment-population ratio graph later.
The fourth graph shows the unemployment rate.  
The unemployment rate decreased in May to 5.8% from 6.1% in April. 
This was below consensus expectations, however March and April were revised up by 27,000 combined.

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of June 1st.
From Black Knight: Forbearance Volumes Fall, Continuing Trend of Early-in-the-Month Improvement
Forbearance volumes fell by 71,000 (-3.2%) week-over-week, continuing the trend of early-in-the-month declines. Decreases were seen across all investor classes, with GSE forbearances falling by 26K (-3.8%), FHA/VA forbearances falling by 28K (-3.2%) and portfolio/PLS plans declining by 17K (-2.7%) over the past seven days.
  
With 65,000 plans still listed with May 2020 expirations, opportunity for an additional modest decline remains for next week as well. Some 700,000 plans are listed with June expirations, marking the final quarterly review for early forbearance entrants before they reach their 18-month expirations later this year.
  
Click on graph for larger image.
  
Plan starts saw their lowest weekly total since the onset of the pandemic, with both new forbearance starts and well as restarts both seeing noticeable declines this week. Another mark of the improvement seen this week: plan exits hit their highest level in four weeks, driven by plan expirations/reviews taking place at the end of May.
  
Given the large review volumes on the horizon, it will be worth keeping a close eye on exit activity in coming weeks – most acutely in the first week of July. As of June 1, 2.12 million (4.0% of) homeowners remain in pandemic-related forbearance plans, including 2.4% of GSE, 7.1% of FHA/VA and 4.7% of portfolio/PLS loans.

                    <span>This paper studies how innovative firms manage their innovation portfolios after filing for Chapter 11 reorganization using three decades of data. We find that they sell off core (i.e., technologically critical and valuable), rather than peripheral, patents in bankruptcy. The selling pattern is driven almost entirely by firms with greater use of secured debt, and the mechanism is secured creditors exercising their control rights on collateralized patents. Creditor-driven patent sales in bankruptcy have implications for technology diffusion—the sold patents diffuse more slowly under new ownership and are more likely to be purchased by patent trolls.</span>

                    <span>Prior literature has established a link between changes in market size and pharmaceutical innovation; whether a link exists with scientific research remains an open question. If upstream research is not responsive to these changes, the kinds of scientific discoveries that flow into future drug development could be disconnected from downstream demand. We explore this question by exploiting the effects of quasi-experimental variation in market size introduced by Medicare Part D. We find no causal relationship between market size and biomedical research in the decade following the implementation of Medicare Part D. While many factors have been shown to motivate scientists to conduct research, this result suggests that changes in market size provide no such incentive. We do find, however, limited support for a response by corporate scientists conducting applied research. Implications for pharmaceutical innovation policy are discussed.</span>

                    <span>Increasingly, retailers have access to better pricing technology, especially in online markets. Using hourly data from five major online retailers, we show that retailers set prices at regular intervals that differ across firms. In addition, faster firms appear to use automated pricing rules that are functions of rivals&#x27; prices. These features are inconsistent with the standard assumptions about pricing technology used in the empirical literature. Motivated by these facts, we consider a model of competition in which firms can differ in pricing frequency and choose pricing algorithms rather than prices. We demonstrate that, relative to the standard simultaneous price-setting model, pricing technology with these features can increase prices in Markov perfect equilibrium. A simple counterfactual simulation implies that pricing algorithms lead to meaningful increases in markups in our empirical setting, especially for firms with the fastest pricing technology.</span>

                    <span>We examine whether medical innovation can reinforce existing health disparities by disproportionately benefiting socioeconomically advantaged patients. The reason is that less advantaged patients often do not use new medications. This may be due to high costs of new drugs, but could also reflect differences in how side effects of new treatments interact with labor supply. To investigate, we develop a dynamic lifecycle model in which the effect of medical treatment on labor supply varies across sociodemographic groups. We estimate the model using rich data on treatment choices and employment decisions of men infected with HIV. In the model, treatments can improve long-run health, but can also cause immediate side effects that interact with the utility cost of work. Estimates indicate that HIV-infected men often forego medication to avoid side effects, in part to remain employed. This effect is stronger for people with fewer years of education, leading to lower use of treatment and worse health outcomes. As a result, while a breakthrough HIV treatment - known as HAART - improved lifetime utility for all patients, it disproportionately benefitted those with higher levels of completed education, thereby reinforcing existing inequality. A counterfactual subsidy that increases non-labor income reduces employment for all education groups, but only increases adoption of HAART and improves health among lower-education individuals, who face a starker health-work tradeoff.</span>

                    <span>HIV/AIDS has been one of the largest public health crises in recent history, and the U.S. federal government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting the disease. This study examines the impact of federal funding allocated to U.S. cities through the Ryan White CARE Act, which is the largest program for combating HIV/AIDS in the United States. The empirical approach identifies the impact of the funding by studying funding variation that comes from Ryan White policy features that resulted in large funding differences among cities that were originally on parallel HIV/AIDS trajectories and finds that Ryan White&#x27;s city-level funding has improved HIV/AIDS outcomes in the cities receiving the funds. The estimates indicate that one HIV/AIDS death has been avoided for every $314,000 allocated through the program and that the program has saved approximately 60,000 lives through 2018. The estimates also indicate that funding differences across cities have contributed to the uneven progress in combating HIV/AIDS across the United States.</span>

                    <span>We use a UK employer-employee administrative earnings dataset to investigate the response of earnings and hours to business cycles. Exploiting our long panel of data from 1975 to 2020 we find wide heterogeneity in the exposure of different types of workers to aggregate shocks. Employees who are younger, male, lower-skilled, non-union, and working in smaller private sector firms show the largest earnings response to recessions. The qualitative patterns of earnings changes across workers observed in the COVID-19 recession are broadly as predicted using the previously estimated exposures and size of the GDP shock. This suggests the COVID-19 recession in terms of its impact responses was relatively similar to those that have gone before, but the GDP shock was far larger in absolute size. Compared to aggregate shocks, we find a relatively small role of firm-specific shocks, suggesting macro shocks play an outsized role in individual earnings dynamics.</span>

                    <span>Corporate bond markets proved remarkably resilient against a sharp contraction caused by the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. We document three important findings: (1) bond issuance increased immediately when the contraction hit, whereas, in contrast, syndicated loan issuance was low; (2) Federal Reserve interventions increased bond issuance, while loan issuance also increased, but to a lesser degree; and (3) bond issuance was concentrated in the investment-grade segment for large and profitable issuers. We compare these results to previous crises and recessions and document similar patterns. We conclude that the U.S. bond market is an important and resilient source of funding for corporations.</span>

                    <span>Most evidence on foreclosure spillovers identifies localized effects that are modest in magnitude, but these effects could multiply to larger aggregate effects across broad neighborhoods. We test this proposition developing a proxy for the fraction of mortgages in negative equity during the foreclosure crisis and estimating a difference-in-differences model for foreclosure. This proxy exploits the timing of foreclosures in each tract, and this within tract variation is not predicted by mortgage attributes, housing attributes or sales prices. Our estimates suggest that 61 percent of the increase in across tract dispersion in foreclosure filings can be explained by these spillover effects.</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 relief legislation offers a unique setting to study how political representation shapes the distribution of federal assistance to state and local governments. We provide evidence of a substantial small-state bias: an additional Senator or Representative per million residents predicts an additional $670 dollars in aid per capita across the four relief packages. Alignment with the Democratic party predicts increases in states’ allocations through legislation designed after the January 2021 political transition. This benefit of partisan alignment operates through the American Rescue Plan Act’s sheer size, as well as the formulas through which it distributed transportation and general relief funds.</span>

                    <span>The organizational structure of U.S. health care has changed dramatically in recent years, with nearly half of physicians now employed by hospitals. This trend toward increasing vertical alignment between physicians and hospitals may alter physician behavior relative to physicians remaining in independent or group practices. We examine the effects of such vertical alignment using an instrumental variable strategy and a clinical context facilitating well-defined episodes of care. We find relatively modest positive effects (point estimates of 7% or lower) on total Medicare payments per episode, characterized by an increase in billable activity among other integrated physicians alongside a large decrease in activity among non-integrated providers. Acquiring hospitals ultimately capture more revenue following a physician practice acquisition; yet, the smaller overall bundle of care generates no net savings to Medicare due to location-based payment rules favorable to hospitals.</span>

Firms selling branded pharmaceuticals bid for preferred slots on the PBM&#x27;s formulary by offering rebates off of list price. We find that PBMs enhance efficiency, but the gains do not accrue to consumers or drug makers. Our analysis offers insights into otherwise puzzling questions. Why do drug makers pay rebates to PBMs? Why do payers delegate formulary operations to a few large PBMs? Why are list prices so high? Why might PBMs vertically integrate with payers? Our framework also offers insights into proposals for market reform.</span>

This paper examines the impact of openings and closings of substance abuse treatment facilities in New Jersey on emergency room visits for substance abuse issues among nearby residents.  We find that drug-related ER visits increase by 16.6% after a facility closure and decrease by 9.5% after an opening.  The effects are largest in relatively under-served areas, among Black residents, and among males.  They are smaller for the middle aged than for either younger or older people.   The results suggest that expanding access to treatment results in significant reductions in morbidity related to drug abuse.</span>

                    <span>The cross-sectional association between pain and unemployment is well-established.  But the absence of panel data containing data on pain and labor market status has meant less is known about the direction of any causal linkage.  Those longitudinal studies that do examine the link between pain and subsequent labor market transitions suggest results are sensitive to the measurement of pain and model specification. We contribute to this literature using large-scale panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for the period 2002 to 2018.  We show that pain leads to job loss.  Workers suffering pain are more likely than others to leave their job for unemployment or economic inactivity.  This probability rises with the frequency of the pain suffered in the previous month.  The effect persists having accounted for fixed unobserved differences across workers, is apparent among those who otherwise report good general health and is robust to the inclusion of controls for mental health, life satisfaction and the employee’s occupation.</span>

We use variation in the number of Twitter users across counties induced by early adopters at the 2007 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, a key event in Twitter&#x27;s rise to popularity. We show that this variation is unrelated to observable county characteristics and electoral outcomes before the launch of Twitter. Our results indicate that Twitter lowered the Republican vote share in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, but had limited effects on Congress elections and previous presidential elections. Evidence from survey data, primary elections, and a text analysis of millions of tweets suggests that Twitter&#x27;s relatively liberal content may have persuaded voters with moderate views to vote against Donald Trump.</span>

                    <span>Introducing heterogeneous households to a New Keynesian small open economy model amplifies the real income channel of exchange rates: the rise in import prices from a depreciation lowers households’ real incomes, and leads them to cut back on spending. When the sum of import and export elasticities is one, this channel is offset by a larger Keynesian multiplier, heterogeneity is irrelevant, and expenditure switching drives the output response. With plausibly lower short-term elasticities, however, the real income channel dominates, and depreciation can be contractionary for output. This weakens monetary transmission and creates a dilemma for policymakers facing capital outflows. Delayed import price pass-through weakens the real income channel, while heterogeneous consumption baskets can strengthen it.</span>

                    <span>We study the impact of selection bias on estimates of the gender pay gap, focusing on whether the gender pay gap has fallen since 1981.  Previous research has found divergent results across techniques, identification strategies, data sets, and time periods.  Using Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics data and a number of different identification strategies, we find robust evidence that, after controlling for selection, there were large declines in the raw and the unexplained gender wage gaps over the 1981-2015 period.  Under our preferred method of accounting for selection, we find that the raw median wage gap declined by 0.378 log points, while the median unexplained gap declined by a more modest but still substantial 0.204 log points.  These declines are larger than estimates that do not account for selection.  Our results suggest that women’s relative wage offers have increased over this period, even after controlling for their measured covariates, including education and actual labor market experience.  However, we note that substantial gender wage gaps remain. In 2015, at the median, the selectivity-corrected gaps were 0.242 log points (raw gap) and 0.206 log points (unexplained gap).</span>

                    <span>The Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in the early 2030s. The U.S. government will need to make a choice about how to address the impending trust fund exhaustion, but it is unclear what it will choose to do. This indecision leaves young and middle-aged workers not knowing whether they will face Social Security benefit cuts, payroll tax increases, or an increase in the full retirement age. This uncertainty about what will happen in the future causes young and middle-aged cohorts who are saving for retirement to make mistakes that could be avoided if the government decided earlier what will happen when the trust fund runs dry. This paper examines the cost of government indecision on Social Security reform. We calculate the value that people in different income classes and different birth cohorts would receive if the government decided now what it will do when the trust funds are exhausted. We find that the cost of indecision can be large. In some cases, the value of knowing today what the policy change will be in 2035 is worth more than two months of labor market earnings.</span>

                    <span>The public debate over disability insurance has centered on concerns about individuals without severe health conditions receiving benefits. We go beyond health risk alone to quantify the overall insurance value of U.S. disability programs, including value from insuring non-health risk. We find that disability recipients, especially those with less-severe health conditions, are much more likely to have experienced a wide variety of non-health shocks than non-recipients. Selection into disability receipt on the basis of non-health shocks is so strong among individuals with less-severe health conditions that by many measures less-severe recipients are worse off than more-severe recipients. As a result, under baseline assumptions, benefits to less-severe recipients have an annual surplus value (insurance benefit less efficiency cost) over cost-equivalent tax cuts of $7,700 per recipient, about three-fourths that of benefits to more-severe recipients ($9,900). Insurance against non-health risk accounts for about one-half of the value of U.S. disability programs.</span>

                    <span>This paper reviews the literature on intergenerational mobility. While our review is centered around the large empirical literature on this topic, we also give a brief discussion of some of the relevant theory. We consider three strands of the empirical literature. First, we discuss how to measure intergenerational persistence in various socio-economic outcomes. We discuss both measurement challenges and some notable findings. We then turn to quantifying the importance of family environment and genetic factors for children&#x27;s outcomes. We describe the pros and cons of various approaches as well as key findings. The third strand is concerned with drawing causal inferences about how children&#x27;s outcomes are affected by specific features of their family environment. We discuss a wide range of environmental features, including the neighborhoods in which children grow up. We critically assess what conclusions one may and may not draw from certain celebrated studies of neighborhoods and intergenerational mobility.</span>

                    <span>We study the transmission of monetary policy through risk premia in a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian environment.  Heterogeneity in households&#x27; marginal propensity to take risk (MPR) summarizes differences in portfolio choice on the margin.  An unexpected reduction in the nominal interest rate redistributes to households with high MPRs, lowering risk premia and amplifying the stimulus to the real economy.  Quantitatively, this mechanism rationalizes the role of news about future excess returns in driving the stock market response to monetary policy shocks and amplifies their real effects by 1.3-1.5 times.</span>

                    <span>Official poverty statistics and even the extreme poverty literature largely ignore people experiencing homelessness. In this paper, we examine the characteristics, labor market attachment, geographic mobility, earnings, and safety net utilization of this population in order to understand their economic well-being. This paper is the first to examine these outcomes at the national level using administrative data on income and government program receipt. It is part of the Comprehensive Income Dataset project, which combines household survey data with administrative records to improve estimates of income and related statistics. Specifically, we use restricted microdata from the 2010 Decennial Census, which enumerates both sheltered and unsheltered homeless people, the 2006-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), which surveys sheltered homeless people, and longitudinal shelter-use data from several major U.S. cities. We link these data to longitudinal administrative tax records as well as administrative data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, housing assistance, and mortality. Our approach benefits from large samples that offer a guide to national homelessness patterns and allow us to compare estimates between data sources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s point-in-time (PIT) counts. By shedding light on issues of data linkage and survey coverage among homeless people, this paper contributes to efforts to better incorporate this hard-to-survey population into income and poverty estimates.</span>

                    <span>The theoretical literature has long noted that talent can be used in both the entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial sectors, and its allocation depends on the reward structure. We test these hypotheses by linking administrative college admissions data for 1.8 million individuals with the universe of firm registration records in China. Within a college, we find that individuals with higher college entrance exam scores – the most important measure of talent in this context – are less likely to create firms, but, when they do, their firms are more successful than those of their lower-score counterparts. Additional survey data suggest that higher-score individuals enjoy higher wages and are more likely to join the state sector. Moreover, the score-to-firm creation relationship varies greatly across industry, according to the size of the state sector. These findings suggest that the score is positively associated with both entrepreneurial ability and wage-job ability but higher-score individuals are attracted away by wage jobs, particularly those of the state sector.</span>

                    <span>The fivefold increase in opioid deaths between 2000 and 2017 rivals even the COVID-19 pandemic as a health crisis for America. Why did it happen? Measures of demand for pain relief – physical pain and despair – are high but largely unchanging. The primary shift is in supply, primarily of new forms of allegedly safer narcotics.  These new pain relievers flowed mostly to areas with more pain, but since their apparent safety was an illusion, opioid deaths followed. By the end of the 2000s, restrictions on legal opioids led to further supply-side innovations which created the burgeoning illegal market that accounts for the bulk of opioid deaths today. Because opioid use is easier to start than end, America’s opioid epidemic is likely to persist for some time.</span>

                    <span>The electoral salience of some issues may diminish when one politician has authority over many policy areas. This study measures the role of environmental regulation in concurrent elections for governors and specialized energy regulators in two U.S. states. I first show that while both offices can influence environmental and energy policies, quantitative analysis of campaign news coverage reveals clear differences in the importance of these issues in the two races. Next, I use geologic variation in earthquakes caused by oil and gas production to measure the electoral consequences of a costly environmental externality. There are measurable effects only in the energy regulator race. These results are consistent with theories of issue bundling. Finally, the unbundling effects that I measure appear to be themselves limited by voter attentiveness and partisanship.</span>

                    <span>Using data from the US Postal Service and Zillow, we quantify the effect of Covid-19 on migration patterns and real estate markets within and across US cities. We find two key results. First, within large US cities, households, businesses, and real estate demand have moved from dense central business districts (CBDs) towards lower density suburban zip-codes. We label this the “Donut Effect” reflecting the movement of activity out of city centers to the suburban ring. Second, while this observed reallocation occurs within cities, we do not see major reallocation across cities. That is, there is less evidence for large-scale movement of activity from large US cities to smaller regional cities or towns. We rationalize these findings by noting that working patterns post pandemic will frequently be hybrid, with workers commuting to their business premises typically three days per week. This level of commuting is less than pre-pandemic, making suburbs relatively more popular, but too frequent to allow employees to leave the cities containing their employer.</span>

                    <span>We develop a state-space model with a state-transition equation that takes the form of a functional vector autoregression and stacks macroeconomic aggregates and a cross-sectional density. The measurement equation captures the error in estimating log densities from repeated cross-sectional samples. The log densities and the transition kernels in the law of motion of the states are approximated by sieves, which leads to a finite-dimensional representation in terms of macroeconomic aggregates and sieve coefficents. We use this model to study the joint dynamics of technology shocks, per capita GDP, employment rates, and the earnings distribution. We find that the estimated spillovers between aggregate and distributional dynamics are generally small, a positive technology shock tends to decrease inequality, and a shock that raises the inequality of earnings leads to a small but not significant increase in GDP.</span>

                    <span>We study financial stability with constraints on central bank intervention. We show that a forced reallocation of liquidity across banks can achieve fewer bank failures than a decentralized market for interbank loans, reflecting a pecuniary externality in the decentralized equilibrium. Importantly, this reallocation can be implemented through the issuance of clearinghouse loan certificates, such as those issued in New York City during the Panic of 1873. With a new dataset constructed from archival records, we demonstrate that the New York Clearinghouse issued loan certificates to member banks in the way our model suggests would have helped resolve the panic.</span>

                    <span>A central issue in privacy governance is understanding how users balance their privacy preferences and data sharing to satisfy service demands. We combine survey and behavioral data of a sample of Alipay users to examine how data privacy preferences affect their data sharing with third-party mini-programs on the Alipay platform. We find that there is no relationship between the respondents’ self-stated privacy concerns and their number of data-sharing authorizations, confirming the puzzling data privacy paradox. Instead of attributing this paradox to the respondents’ unreliable survey responses, resignation from active protection of their data privacy, or behavioral factors in making their data-sharing choices, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by a curious finding that users with stronger privacy concerns tend to benefit more from using mini-programs. This positive relationship between privacy concerns and digital demands further suggests that consumers may develop data privacy concerns as a by-product of the process of using digital applications, not because such concerns are innate.</span>

It shows that a decrease in the subsidy rate leads to a decrease in manufacturing employment, highlighting spillovers to untreated sectors in treated counties and untreated counties connected via trade and local taxes. It also finds that the place-based policy is at least as efficient as cash transfers for the unemployed but is more effective in curbing regional inequality overall.</span>

                    <span>Since the Global Crisis, the channels of capital flows have changed significantly. This column analyses key trends and underlying drivers of capital flows since the Global Crisis, including the policy trade-offs. It documents the increasing importance of market-based funding, a growing reliance on domestic currency liabilities, and a less stable foreign direct investment environment, particularly for emerging market economies. Although these changes create risks which should be managed, capital flows also present clear benefits for stimulating economic performance and efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Sales slumped in April and May 2020, so the year-over-year (YoY) increase is large.   That will likely reverse in June and sales will be down YoY.

Note: I&#x27;m tracking data for many local markets around the U.S.  I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.

From the DMAR: Monthly Indicators, May 2021


Total Residential Units Sold in May 2021 were 5,322, up 48.7% from 3,578 in May 2020.


Active Residential Listings in May 2021 were 2,075, down from 2,594 last month, and down 71.1% from 7,170 in May 2020.


Inventory in Denver had been fairly steady over the last 6 or 7 years, but declined sharply in 2020.  This is the lowest level of inventory for May on record.


Interesting - In May, half the homes listed were sold (under contract) within four days!</span>

We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 750k in May (mom sa) ... Following the surprisingly weak April report, we believe the further easing of business restrictions more than offset a moderate drag from labor supply factors and seasonality. ... We estimate a three-tenths drop in the unemployment rate to 5.8% (consensus 5.9%), reflecting a strong household employment gain but a further rise in the participation rate.

Some analysts are being cautious this month after the disappointing April report.   
• First, currently there are still about 8.2 million fewer jobs than in February 2020 (before the pandemic).
This graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but is now better than the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.

 Private sector employment increased by 978,000 jobs from April to May according to the May ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly distributed to the public each  month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from ADP’s actual payroll data,  measures the change in total nonfarm private employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
“Private payrolls showed a marked improvement from recent months and the strongest gain since the  early days of the recovery,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP. “While goods producers grew at  a steady pace, it is service providers that accounted for the lion’s share of the gains, far outpacing the  monthly average in the last six months. Companies of all sizes experienced an uptick in job growth,  reflecting the improving nature of the panemic and economy.”
emphasis added
  This was well above the consensus forecast of 650,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 650 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in May.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.</span>

                    <span>As Covid-19 spread in early 2020, many central banks were still struggling to boost inflation. The abruptness and speed of the economic deterioration, the sharp increase in market volatility, and the blinding uncertainty over the impact of the pandemic motivated a central bank reaction that was unprecedented in terms of size, speed and scope. A new CEPR eBook summarises the responses by sixteen central banks from both advanced and emerging economies – with chapters written by senior central bank officials and economists in each of the countries to explain the actions taken. While responses varied across countries, there are several common threads: the size, speed and breadth of the responses; the reliance on a more multidimensional set of tools; and the ability of emerging markets to behave more like advanced economies.</span>

                    <span>In the aftermath of past pandemics, fiscal policy played an important role in reducing or amplifying income inequality. This column predicts the likely distributional effects of Covid-19 by analysing evidence from five previous outbreaks (SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, and Zika). It finds that severe austerity measures were associated with inequality increases three times greater than expansive fiscal policy following a pandemic. Premature austerity is self-defeating from both a macro and an equity standpoint.</span>

The national economy expanded at a moderate pace from early April to late May, a somewhat faster rate than the prior reporting period. Several Districts cited the positive effects on the economy of increased vaccination rates and relaxed social distancing measures, while they also noted the adverse impacts of supply chain disruptions. The effects of expanded vaccination rates were perhaps most notable in consumer spending in which increases in leisure travel and restaurant spending augmented ongoing strength in other spending categories.

Below is a graph of expenditures on energy goods and services as a percent of total personal consumption expenditures through April 2021.
This is one of the measures that Professor Hamilton at Econbrowser looks at to evaluate any drag on GDP from energy prices.

The huge spikes in energy prices during the oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 are obvious.  As is the increase in energy prices during the 2001 through 2008 period. 
In general, energy expenditures as a percent of PCE have been trending down for years.
At the beginning of the pandemic, energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE, fell to a record low of 3.3% in May 2020.


In April 2021,  energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE had rebounded somewhat and were at 3.8% of PCE.  This is about the same level as in early 2020 (pre-pandemic).</span>

                    <span>India only introduced credit scoring technology in 2007. This column studies its adoption by the two main types of banks in the country: new private banks and state-owned public sector banks. While both types of banks check nearly all scores for new borrowers, public sector banks are very slow to adopt scoring for their prior relationship borrowers even though scores are reliable predictors of delinquency. Government ownership does not explain this slow adoption, as older privatebanks also exhibit similar adoption patterns. The findings suggest that practices from the past, when adapted to different regulatory and economic environments, are slow to change and can hold back better practices today.</span>

                    <span>At the end of 2019 the European Systemic Risk Board General Board mandated a Task Force on Low Interest Rates to revisit the ESRB’s 2016 report on “Macroprudential policy issues arising from low interest rates and structural changes in the EU financial system”, assess subsequent developments, compare these to the risks identified in the report, and assess whether new sources of systemic risk have emerged. Furthermore, the Task Force was mandated to review progress in relation to the policy proposals in the earlier report, as well as propose possible new policy actions aimed at mitigating potential systemic risks. As this column discusses, the new report finds that the low interest rate environment continues to pose risks for financial stability. For instance, since 2016, search-for-yield behaviour has intensified in the banking and investment fund sectors, and some business models are proving unsustainable. To address these sources of risk and vulnerabilities, the report puts forward a wide range of policy options.</span>

                    <span>Better communications, enhanced transport links, integration agreements between governments, and other factors have all helped increase global economic interconnectedness over the past few decades. This column compares a state-of-the-art gravity model for trade versus migration to reveal that there are in fact important differences in the evolution of globalisation over time on flows of goods versus people. For trade, the boost from free trade agreements declines the farther apart signatories are, but for migration the boost increases with distance between signatories. Further, while both border and distance frictions have declined for trade over time, this is not the case for migration flows.</span>

우리는 일상에서 접하는 대부분이 인터넷과 연결된 세계에 살고 있다. 사용자에게 최고의 경험을 제공하기 위해서는 빠른 변화와 다양성에 적극 반응하고 적응하는 것이 중요하다. 그런데 사용자는 웹 서비스 개발자가 예상하는 것과 다르게 반응하고 행동한다. 이때 A/B 테스트로 대표되는 최적화 기술이 유용하다. 

A/B 테스트에서 숫자로 나타난 사용자의 선택뿐만 아니라 그 이면에 숨겨진 데이터를 가설 검증에 활용해 더 나은 최적화 설계를 수행할 수 있게 해준다. 이제까지 베일에 가려져 있던 이 중요한 기술을 체계적으로 정리한 책은 국내에 없었다. 이 책은 통계학과 머신러닝이라는 수학적 방법을 이용해 최적화를 설명하고 코드를 통해 구체적으로 알기 쉽게 정리했다.

저자가 다년간의 정보 보안 강의, 컨설팅, 개발 경험을 토대로 작성한 해킹 요리 비법서다. 파이썬 3.9, Asyncio, BeautifulSoup, 비동기 문법 등 최신 파이썬 트렌드를 반영한 코드는 싱싱한 요리 재료이며 기본에 충실히 풀어나가는 이론은 레시피와 같다. 직접 작성해보는 악성코드, 메시지 은닉 채널, 네트워크 스캐너, XSS, SQL Injection, 크롤러 등 직접 만든 도구를 하나하나 따라가다 보면 어느새 해킹을 파이썬으로 입맛에 맞게 요리하는 자신을 발견할 수 있을 것이다.
