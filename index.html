                    <span>In July, the ECB issued its first Strategic Review since 2003. The latest CfM-CEPR survey investigates one component of the announced policy shift: the new definition of price stability. Most members of the panel of experts on the European economy support the ECB explicitly allowing inflation to exceed its target for extended periods to make up for below-target inflation in the past. This 60% majority has divided views on the optimal alternative policies, with the largest share supporting average inflation targeting and some members supporting nominal GDP targeting or hybrid policies. 40% of the panel would prefer to maintain the current policy of traditional inflation targeting.</span>

                    <span>The Japanese economy has experienced a prolonged slowdown in growth and persistent declines in the real interest rate, while at the same time the country’s labour force has been rapidly ageing. This column explores a novel causal link between the ageing labour force and the low-frequency declining trend in the real interest rate since the 1970s, and suggests that the ageing of the labour force accounts for 40% or more of the declines in the real interest rate observed between the 1980s and 2000s in Japan.</span>

 A number of participants assessed that the standard of substantial further progress toward the goal of maximum employment had not yet been attained but that, if the economy proceeded roughly as they anticipated, it may soon be reached. On the basis of the cumulative performance of the labor market since December 2020, a number of other participants indicated that they believed that the test of &quot;substantial further progress&quot; toward maximum employment had been met. Some of these participants also suggested that labor supply constraints were the main impediments to further improvement in labor market conditions rather than lack of demand.

                    <span>With the release of the CPI report this morning, we now know the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), and the contribution base for 2022.
From Social Security: Social Security Announces 5.9 Percent Benefit Increase for 2022
Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for approximately 70 million Americans will increase 5.9 percent in 2022, the Social Security Administration announced today.
The 5.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will begin with benefits payable to more than 64 million Social Security beneficiaries in January 2022. Increased payments to approximately 8 million SSI beneficiaries will begin on December 30, 2021. (Note: some people receive both Social Security and SSI benefits). The Social Security Act ties the annual COLA to the increase in the Consumer Price Index as determined by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Some other adjustments that take effect in January of each year are based on the increase in average wages. Based on that increase, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) will increase to $147,000 from $142,800.
Currently CPI-W is the index that is used to calculate the Cost-Of-Living Adjustments (COLA).  Here is a discussion from Social Security on the current calculation (5.9% increase) and a list of previous Cost-of-Living Adjustments. 
The contribution and benefit base will be $147,000 in 2022.
The National Average Wage Index increased to $55,628.60 in 2020, up 2.83% from $54,099.99 in 2019 (used to calculate contribution base).</span>

Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.4 percent before seasonal adjustment.
The indexes for food and shelter rose in September and together contributed more than half of the monthly all items seasonally adjusted increase. The index for food rose 0.9 percent, with the index for food at home increasing 1.2 percent. The energy index increased 1.3 percent, with the gasoline index rising 1.2 percent.
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in September, after increasing 0.1 percent in August. Along with the index for shelter, the indexes for new vehicles, household furnishings and operations, and motor vehicle insurance also rose in September. The indexes for airline fares, apparel, and used cars and trucks all declined over the month.
The all items index rose 5.4 percent for the 12 months ending September, compared to a 5.3-percent rise for the period ending August. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.0 percent over the last 12 months, the same increase as the period ending August. The energy index rose 24.8 percent over the last 12 months, and the food index increased 4.6 percent over that period.

                    <span>Early this year, from Jann Swanson at MortgageNewsDaily: Fannie Warns Lenders on Investment Properties and 2nd Homes. 
I&#x27;m looking at data for some second home markets - and will track those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through September 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.
  
   Click on graph for larger image.
Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Currently inventory is still very low, but solidly above the record low set six months ago, and prices are up sharply YoY.   

This will be interesting to watch, but so far there isn&#x27;t any evidence of a 2nd home slowdown in these numbers (The fires don&#x27;t seem to have impacted these numbers either).</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Newsletter: Will House Prices Increase &quot;a further 16% by the end of 2022&quot;?
Excerpt: 
Yesterday, Goldman Sachs economist Ronnie Walker wrote a research note forecasting US house prices would increase a further 16% by the end of 2022: The Housing Shortage: Prices, Rents, and Deregulation. This caused quite a stir on twitter. 
...
First, this is a projection for the end of next year. The most recent Case-Shiller report was for July, so this projection is for 17 months. This forecast is for an average of about 0.9% per month, well below the 1.5% per month average over the last year.
Here is what the forecast would look like:

                    <span>From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings declined to 10.4 million on the last business day of August following a  series high in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires decreased to 6.3 million  while total separations were little changed at 6.0 million. Within separations, the quits rate increased to a  series high of 2.9 percent while the layoffs and discharges rate was little changed at 0.9 percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for August, the most recent employment report was for September.
 Click on graph for larger image.
Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spike in layoffs and discharges in March  2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings decreased in August to 10.439 million from 11.098 million in July.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 62% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 43% year-over-year to a new record high.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for &quot;quits&quot;).</span>

주식시장을 강타하는 주가폭락은 월가의 투자가들에게도 두려움의 대상이다. 공포심을 자극하는 각종 기사와 보고서가 쏟아지고 투매가 벌어진다. 이런 상황에서 이성적으로 투자 결정을 내리기란 무척 어렵다. 원칙 없는 감정적인 대처 때문에 막대한 손실을 입기도 한다. 

크로스비는 이처럼 주식투자의 성공과 실패를 가르는 열쇠가 판단력을 흐리는 심리적 요인에 있음을 밝히고, 심리적 요인을 통제해 수익을 극대화하는 성공적인 투자법을 연구했다. 행동투자의 선구자인 그의 글과 강연은 월가의 투자가들이 더 나은 투자 결정을 내리는 통찰의 원천이 되고 있다. 

이 책 《시장을 이기는 부의 심리학》은 출간 당시 일반 투자자들뿐만 아니라 수많은 펀드 매니저, 투자 컨설턴트에게 찬사를 받은 크로스비의 대표 저작이다. 중요한 상황에 직면했을 때 과도한 시도를 추구하는 경향인 행동편향이 어떻게 투자 성과를 망치는지 보여주고, 대안적 투자 기법으로 규칙 기반의 행동 투자 모델(RIB)을 제시한다. 

저자는 감정적인 투자자가 흥분 상태에서 주식을 너무 비싸게 매수하고 절망적인 상태에서 너무 싸게 매도할 수 있다고 지적한다. 또한 지나친 걱정 때문에 시장의 혼란이 큰 수익의 전조가 될 수 있음에도, 그 시점을 인지하는 데 실패한다고 말한다. 자기 자신의 심리상태가 성공 투자의 걸림돌이 되는 것이다.

한 주에도 몇 개씩 쏟아져 나오는 신조어, 신상품, 새로운 매체를 좇는 대신 생활변화의 흐름을 이해하는 오늘날의 시대감성을 제시한다. 완벽함보다는 노력형, 예쁨보다는 멋짐으로 대변되는 시대감성과 지루한 일상을 콘텐츠로 승화하는 이들의 이야기가 펼쳐진다. 또한 주가가 오르고 내리듯 시세와 차트를 만드는 디지털 밈, 하이퍼리얼리즘과 메타버스 등, 한 번쯤 들어봤지만 정확하게 이해하지는 못했던 오늘의 문화코드에 대해서도 알 수 있을 것이다. 

새로운 세대가 궁금한가? ‘요즘 애들은 어떤 애들이야?’, ‘뭐 하고 놀아?’라는 막연한 질문으로는 답을 얻을 수 없다. 그럴수록 점점 시대감성에서 동떨어진 존재가 될 뿐이다. 그들이 남긴 흔적과 데이터가 담고 있는 스토리를 보아야 한다. 그 속에서 탄생하는 문화를 보고, 새로운 시대가 요청하는 것에 행보를 맞춰야 한다. 도표와 이야기로 풀어가는 2022년의 미래상을 따라감으로써, 무엇이든 잊히기 쉬운 이 시대에 기억되는 사람, 기억되는 브랜드가 되는 힌트를 얻을 수 있을 것이다.

16가지의 키워드를 통해 위드 코로나 시대에 접어들면서 달라진 라이프스타일의 변화 방향성을 탐색하고, 디지털 기반으로 변화되는 시대상과 마케팅에 대한 속 깊은 이야기를 들려준다. 

이 책은 글로벌 광고마케팅 회사 이노션 인사이트그룹에서 근무하는 16인의 컨설턴트가 치열한 분석 끝에 내놓은 특별한 보고서로, 그저 변화하는 현상의 나열이 아닌 변화의 원인과 그 변화가 궁극적으로 가져올 마케팅 커뮤니케이션에서의 시사점과 활용 가치에 주안점을 둔다. 나아가 위드 코로나 시대의 일상과 놀이문화, 각종 제도적 변화로 인해 달라질 세상의 모습, 사회문화적 환경 변화 속에서의 마케팅 이슈들에 대해 치열하게 고민한 결과물을 담았다. 

또한 이 책에는 어디에서도 볼 수 없는 ‘스페셜 리포트’가 수록됐는데, 이는 소비자 행동과 브랜드에 대한 태도, 마케팅 환경의 급격한 변화에도 불구하고 기존 방식으로 분석한 지수들에 의존한다는 비판적 시선에서 탄생한 것으로, 앞으로 주목받을 ‘쿨한’ 브랜드에 대해 심층적으로 분석한 내용을 선보인다. 

이 책에는 마케팅 환경의 변화와 브랜드가 가진 고민을 가장 가까이에서 체감하는 광고대행사의 마케팅 커뮤니케이션 전문가들이 현장에서 겪은 경험이 생생하게 담겨 있다. 각종 행사나 회의가 온라인으로 대체되고 사람들끼리 한 공간에서 이야기하기도 힘든 위드 코로나 …</span>

                    <span>Despite clear economic benefits of new digital technologies, slow median wage growth has led many to worry that these new technologies are failing to deliver for the average worker. This column develops a new model of global automation and technological change to study the long-term consequences of these trends. It finds that automation can boost output and growth, but these benefits are not equally distributed across or within regions. Nevertheless, in developed countries smart fiscal policy, such as universal basic income, can make new technologies a win-win for all age and skill groups.</span>

                    <span>By boosting labor incomes and asset prices, a monetary easing is often believed to benefit the vast majority of households. This column argues that this intuition is misleading, because the effect of asset price changes for households depends not just on asset holdings, but on their maturity structure, which is largely driven by life-cycle motives. A typical monetary policy easing redistributes welfare from older to younger generations. Moreover, the resulting asset price appreciation is harmful for households that accumulate housing and save for retirement.</span>

                    <span>A few excerpts from a Goldman Sachs research note: The Housing Shortage: Prices, Rents, and Deregulation  
Of all the shortages afflicting the US economy, the housing shortage might last the longest. Earlier this year, we argued that constrained supply and sustainably robust demand would keep the US housing market very tight, pushing up home prices and rents sharply. The boom since then has surpassed even our lofty expectations, with home prices now up 20% over the last year. ...
The supply-demand picture that has been the basis for our call for a multi-year boom in home prices remains intact. Housing inventories remain historically tight, while homes remain relatively affordable despite the recent price increases, and surveys of home buying intentions remain at healthy levels. Our model now projects that home prices will grow a further 16% by the end of 2022.

Excerpt: 
The general rule of thumb is refinance activity will be strong if current mortgage rates are 50bps lower than the maximum of the previous year (this is just a general rule - but it works pretty well).
The following graph shows the MBA Refinance Index (Blue) and the change in mortgage rates (Red). The change is calculated as Maximum in Previous Year minus the current rate). When the red line is above 0.5% (more than 50bps decline in mortgage rates), then refinance activity generally picks up.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of October 8th, inventory was at 426 thousand (7 day average), compared to 555 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.3%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55% from 947 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 428 thousand, and was down 23.9% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 39% above the record low in early April.


Now inventory may have peaked for the year in early September.   Five weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far), so inventory is currently off about 2.6% from the peak for the year.


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for October.</span>

                    <span>In spring 2005, Austria launched a campaign to inform employers and newspapers that gender preferences in job advertisements were illegal. At the time over 40% of openings on the nation’s largest job-board specified a preferred gender.  Over the next year the fraction fell to under 5%. We merge data on filled vacancies to linked employer-employee data to study how the elimination of gender preferences affected hiring and job outcomes. Prior to the campaign, most stated preferences were concordant with the firm’s existing gender composition, but a minority targeted the opposite gender - a subset we call non-stereotypical vacancies. Vacancies with a gender preference were very likely (&gt;90%) to be filled by someone of that gender. We use pre-campaign vacancies to predict the probabilities of specifying preferences for females, males, or neither gender. We then conduct event studies of the effect of the campaign on the predicted preference groups. We find that the elimination of gender preferences led to a rise in the fraction of women hired for jobs that were likely to be targeted to men (and vice versa), increasing the diversity of hiring workplaces. Partially offsetting this effect, we find a reduction in the success of non-stereotypical vacancies in hiring the targeted gender, and indications of a decline in the efficiency of matching.  For the much larger set of stereotypical vacancies, however, vacancy filling times, wages, and job durations were largely unaffected by the campaign, suggesting that the elimination of stated preferences had at most small consequences on overall job match efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Recent research shows the negative impact of discrimination not only on the targets of discrimination but also on the economy as a whole. Racial and gender inequality can limit the entire economy&#x27;s productive capacity and innovation outcomes. Using new data from NSF&#x27;s Survey of Earned Doctorates on the scientific workforce from 1980 to 2019, as well as patenting and commercialization data, we examine racial and gender disparities at each stage of the innovation process—education and training, the practice of invention, and commercialization. While improving along certain dimensions over time, we find persistent racial and gender disparities consistent with the current literature. To reverse the negative effects on productive capacity and long-run economic growth, we also discuss the literature on mitigating discriminatory practices at each juncture, which could have significant distributional effects as access to good jobs expands.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the dynamics of unemployment (u) and its natural rate (u*), with u* measured by real-time estimates for 29 countries from the OECD. We find strong evidence of hysteresis: an innovation in u causes u* to change in the same direction, and therefore has permanent effects. For our baseline specification, a one percentage point deviation of u from u* for one year has a long-run effect of 0.16 points on both variables. When we allow asymmetry, we find, perhaps surprisingly, that decreases in u have larger long-run effects than increases in u.</span>

                    <span>We explore the sources of racial disparities in small business lending by studying the $806 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was designed to support small business jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. PPP loans were administered by private lenders but federally guaranteed, largely eliminating unobservable credit risk as a factor in explaining differential lending by race. We document that even after controlling for a firm’s zip code, industry, loan size, PPP approval date, and other characteristics, Black-owned businesses were 12.1 percentage points (70% of the mean) more likely to obtain their PPP loan from a fintech lender than a traditional bank. Among conventional lenders, smaller banks were much less likely to lend to Black-owned firms, while the Top-4 banks exhibited little to no disparity after including controls. We use novel data to show that the disparity is not primarily explained by differences in pre-existing bank or credit relationships, firm financial positions, fintech affinity, or borrower application behavior. In contrast, we document that Black-owned businesses’ higher rate of borrowing from fintechs compared to smaller banks is particularly large in places with high racial animus, pointing to a potential role for discrimination in explaining some of the racial disparities in small business lending. We find evidence that when small banks automate their lending processes, and thus reduce human involvement in the loan origination process, their rate of PPP lending to Black-owned businesses increases, with larger effects in places with more racial animus.</span>

                    <span>Income taxes are typically set to raise revenues and redistribute income at the lowest possible efficiency costs, which result from the distortions in individual behaviors that taxes entail. Individuals can respond along many margins, such as labor supply, tax avoidance and evasion, and geographic mobility. But one margin that taxes may affect — innovation — is less frequently considered. Conceptually, taxes reduce the expected net returns to innovation inputs and can reduce innovation. Much like other margins of responses to taxes, this efficiency cost must be taken into account. Innovation is done by a relatively small number of people, but it is nevertheless likely to have widespread benefits. While inventors may have divergent motivations, such as social recognition or the love of discovery, they also face an economic reality. How strongly innovation responds to taxes is an empirical question that has been the subject of a growing body of recent work. In this paper, I study how to account for innovation when setting personal income and capital taxation. I distinguish between two cases: one in which the government can set a differentiated tax on inventors and one in which the government is constrained to set the same tax on all agents. I provide a model that flexibly accounts for the spillovers generated by innovation and the non-pecuniary benefits inventors receive from innovation and derive tax formulas expressed in terms of estimable sufficient statistics. The second part of the paper discusses the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on the quantity, quality, and location of innovation, as well as tax avoidance and income shifting done through innovation.</span>

                    <span>Almost all countries announced fiscal support programs once COVID-19 hit. However, there was significant diversity in the magnitude and composition of these fiscal stimulus programs. These differences were determined by myriad political, financial, social, and economic factors - these factors are our focus. We ask what were the factors that are associated with the structure of the fiscal programs that governments chose to adopt in the early stage of the pandemic in 2020. We answer this question using details about the fiscal programs that were announced by 98 governments in the first six months of the pandemic, together with a large set of explanatory variables. Maybe not surprisingly, we find that politics played a very significant part in determining the size and composition of these fiscal programs. Governments and societies that are less polarized and more capable were able to mobilise more fiscal resources. We also find that it was governments with bigger debt loads that announced bigger programs, but that sovereign spreads were not so clearly associated with the size of these program plans. There is a limit, however, to what we can glean from these cross-country comparisons. Ultimately, the understanding of the politics and political-economy considerations that led to the specific content of each fiscal program will have to rely on information about the actual deliberations in each government’s halls of power, should these ever become public.</span>

The specific new contribution is to study as-if optimization using estimates of illness probabilities in clinical choice between surveillance and aggressive treatment. Beyond its specifics, the paper sends a broad message. Statisticians and computer scientists have addressed conditional prediction for decision making in indirect ways, the former applying classical statistical theory and the latter measuring prediction accuracy in test samples. Neither approach is satisfactory. Statistical decision theory provides a coherent, generally applicable methodology.</span>

                    <span>This paper uses the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how macroprudential frameworks developed over the past decade performed during a period of heightened financial and economic stress. It discusses a new measure of the macroprudential stance that better captures the intensity of different policies across countries and time. Then it shows that macroprudential policy has been used countercyclically—with stances tightened during the 2010’s and eased in response to COVID-19 by more than previous risk-off periods. Countries that tightened macroprudential policy more aggressively before COVID, as well as those that eased more during the pandemic, experienced less financial and economic stress. Countries’ ability to use macroprudential policy, however, was significantly constrained by the extent of existing “policy space”, i.e., by how aggressively policy was tightened before COVID-19. The use of macroprudential tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use other policy tools (such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, FX intervention, and capital flow management measures), and the use of other tools was not significantly affected by the space available to use macroprudential policy. This suggests that although macroprudential tools are being used countercyclically and should therefore help stabilize economies and financial markets, there appears to be an opportunity to better integrate the use of macroprudential tools with other policies in the future.</span>

                    <span>Children&#x27;s experiences during early childhood are critical for their cognitive and socio-emotional development, two key dimensions of human capital. However, children from low income backgrounds often grow up lacking stimulation and basic investments, leading to developmental deficits that are difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later in life without intervention. The existence of these deficits are a key driver of inequality and contribute to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In this paper, we discuss the framework used in economics to model parental investments and early childhood development and use it as an organizing tool to review some of the empirical evidence on early childhood research. We then present results from various important early childhoods interventions with emphasis on developing countries. Bringing these elements together we draw conclusions on what we have learned and provide some directions for future research.</span>

                    <span>If the U.S. is on a fiscally sustainable path, then higher U.S. government debt/output ratios should reliably predict higher future surpluses or lower real returns on Treasurys. In the post-war sample, we find no evidence for this. Neither future cash flows nor discount rates account for the variation in the current debt/output ratio. Instead, the future debt/output ratio accounts for most of the variation. Systematic surplus forecast errors can account for part of these findings. Since the start of the GFC, surplus projections have anticipated a large fiscal correction that failed to materialize.</span>

Our discussion encompasses the history of anchor currency choice, methods for classifying exchange rate regimes, a detailed discussion of the evolution of regimes, the growing substitution of reserves for capital controls as a tool for exchange rate stabilization, the modern Triffin dilemma, and the surprising recent trend decline in volatility of exchange rates at the core of the system.

We compare the adherence of patients without personal access to medical expertise to the adherence of those with access, namely doctors and their close relatives. We estimate that, among observably similar patients, access to expertise is associated with 3.8 percentage points lower adherence, relative to a baseline adherence rate of 54.4 percent among those without access. This association is larger for recommendations with a weaker clinical motivation.

                    <span>Previous measures of the incidence of public investment in higher education focus on the transfer to public college students. This implies that the net benefits to students who do not attend public colleges is negative. However, they miss potential general equilibrium effects on the private college and labor markets. Changes in the public college market affect who private colleges admit, what prices they charge, and the number of students who enroll in any college. We show that capturing these spillovers is important for characterizing incidence using a model of higher education that we validate with quasi-experimental variation in state spending. Unlike previous measures, we find that high-income-modest-ability students especially benefit since they are only admitted to high-quality private colleges when state spending is high, and the public colleges create sufficient competitive pressure. Decreased investment also reduces educational attainment, raising the college wage premium. This exacerbates private college market power.</span>

                    <span>How much has the US-China tariff war impacted economic outcomes in China? We address this question using high-frequency night lights data, together with measures of the trade exposure of fine grid locations constructed from Chinese firms&#x27; geo-coordinates. Exploiting within-grid variation over time and controlling extensively for grid-specific contemporaneous trends, we find that each 1 percentage point increase in exposure to the US tariffs was associated with a 0.59% reduction in night-time luminosity. We combine these with structural elasticities that relate night lights to economic outcomes, motivated by the statistical framework of Henderson et al. (2012). The negative impact of the tariff war was highly skewed across locations: While grids with negligible direct exposure to the US tariffs accounted for up to 70% of China&#x27;s population, we infer that the 2.5% of the population in grids with the largest US tariff shocks saw a 2.52% (1.62%) decrease in income per capita (manufacturing employment) relative to unaffected grids. By contrast, we do not find significant effects from China&#x27;s retaliatory tariffs.</span>

Furthermore, firms tend to purchase more S&amp;P ratings when there are openings in the index membership.

                    <span>The proposed change under the American Families Plan (AFP) to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) Child Tax Credit (CTC) would increase maximum benefit amounts to $3,000 or $3,600 per child (up from $2,000 per child) and make the full credit available to all low and middle-income families regardless of earnings or income. We estimate the anti-poverty, targeting, and labor supply effects of the expansion by linking survey data with administrative tax and government program data which form part of the Comprehensive Income Dataset (CID). Initially ignoring any behavioral responses, we estimate that the expansion of the CTC would reduce child poverty by 34% and deep child poverty by 39%. The expansion of the CTC would have a larger anti-poverty effect on children than any existing government program, though at a higher cost per child raised above the poverty line than any other means-tested program. Relatedly, the CTC expansion would allocate a smaller share of its total dollars to families at the bottom of the income distribution—as well as families with the lowest levels of long-term income, education, or health—than any existing means-tested program with the exception of housing assistance. We then simulate anti-poverty effects accounting for labor supply responses. By replacing the TCJA CTC (which contained substantial work incentives akin to the Earned Income Tax Credit) with a universal basic income-type benefit, the CTC expansion reduces the return to working at all by at least $2,000 per child for most workers with children. Relying on elasticity estimates consistent with mainstream simulation models and the academic literature, we estimate that this change in policy would lead 1.5 million workers (constituting 2.6% of all working parents) to exit the labor force. The decline in employment and the consequent earnings loss would mean that child poverty would only fall by 22% and deep child poverty would not fall at all with the CTC expansion.</span>

                    <span>We exploit substantial variation in land-market institutions across Indian states and detailed micro household-level panel data to assess the effect of distortions in land rental markets on agricultural productivity. We provide empirical evidence that states with more rental-market activity feature less misallocation and reallocate land more efficiently over time. We develop a model of heterogeneous farms and land rentals to estimate land-market distortions in each state. Land rentals have substantial positive effects on agricultural productivity: an efficient reallocation of land increases agricultural productivity by 38 percent on average and by more than 50 percent in states with highly distorted rental markets. Both farm and state-level land market distortions are quantitatively important, with state-level wedges accounting for a significant fraction of rental market participation differences across states. Land market distortions contribute about one-third to the large differences in agricultural total factor productivity across Indian states.</span>

                    <span>We examine how the net worth of billionaires relates to their looks, as rated by 16 people of different gender and ethnicity. Surprisingly, their financial assets are unrelated to their beauty; nor are they related to their educational attainment. As a group, however, billionaires are both more educated and better-looking than average for their age. Men, people who reside in Western countries, and those who inherited substantial wealth, are wealthier than other billionaires. The results do not arise from measurement error or nonrandom sample selectivity. They are consistent with econometric theory about the impact of truncating a sample to include observations only from the extreme tail of the dependent variable. The point is underscored by comparing estimates of earnings equations using all employees in the 2018 American Community Survey to those using a sample of the top 0.1 percent. The findings suggest the powerful role of luck within the extremes of the distributions of economic outcomes.</span>

                    <span>We study whether vouchers with and without value information encourage completion of already free follow-up appointments in a low-income minority population in Baltimore City referred for definitive evaluation of possible eye disease. Between May 2017 and September 2018, 821 individuals referred for free follow-up from 114 screening events received 1) standard referral, 2) a voucher redeemable for free follow-up and prescription glasses, or 3) a voucher including a statement of monetary value ($250). All referred individuals received patient education, counseling, and appointment reminders. We find that vouchers with and without value information increase follow-up appointments by 12.5 and 20.3 percentage points, respectively, corresponding to a 36%-58% increase compared to the standard referral with no voucher. We conclude that reframing free targeted health service offers by providing vouchers with value information is a promising, low-cost tool to increase uptake.</span>

We present causal evidence on the economic drivers of biodiversity loss using a novel panel dataset on the types and quantities of wildlife at thousands of locations across the U.S. from 1960-2015. Exploiting fiscal and regulatory shocks to local economic output, we document large, negative impacts of GDP on abundance and diversity of species spanning multiple taxa. The adverse effects of production are mitigated by conservation and air emission abatement efforts, which points toward habitat losses and pollution as underlying contributors to contemporaneous biodiversity declines.</span>

                    <span>Interest rates on government debt have fallen in many countries over the last several decades, with markets indicating that rates may stay low well into the future.  It is by now well understood that sustained low interest rates can change the nature of long-run fiscal policy choices.  In this paper, we examine a related issue: the implications of sustained low interest rates for the structure of tax policy.  We show that low interest rates (a) reduce the differences between consumption and income taxes; (b) make wealth taxes less efficient relative to capital income taxes, at given rates of tax; (c) reduce the value of firm-level investment incentives, and (d) substantially raise the valuation of benefits of carbon abatement policies relative to their costs.</span>

                    <span>Covid-19 highlighted the weaknesses in the supply chain. Many have argued that a more resilient or robust supply chain is needed. But what does a robust supply chain mean? And how do firms’ decisions change when taken that approach? This paper studies a very stylized model of a supply chain, where we study how the decision of a multinational corporation changes in the presence of uncertainty. The two standard theories of supply chain are Just-in-time and Just-in-case. Just-in-time argues in favor of pursuing efficiency, while Just-in-case studies how such decision changes when the firm faces idiosyncratic risk. We find that a robust supply chain is very different specially in the presence of systemic shocks. In this case, firms need to concentrate on the worst-case. This strategy implies a supply chain where the allocation of resources and capabilities does not correspond to the standard theories studied in economics, but follow a heuristic behavioral rule called “probability matching”. It has been found in nature and in experimental research that subjects appeal to probability matching when seeking survival. We find that a robust supply chain will reproduce this behavioral outcome. In fact, a multinational optimizing under uncertainty, follows a probability matching which leads to an allocation that is suboptimal from the individual producer point of view, but rules out the possibility of supply disruptions.</span>

This article provides an interim overview of these effects, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Economists have explained how the pandemic is likely to have differential consequences for LMICs, and demand distinct policy responses, compared to rich countries. We survey the rapidly expanding body of empirical research that documents its many adverse economic and non-economic effects in terms of living standards, education, health, and gender equality, which appear to be unprecedented in depth and scale. We also review research on successful and failed policy responses, including the failure to ensure widespread vaccine coverage in LMICs, which is needed to end the pandemic. We close with a discussion of implications for public policy in LMICs, and for the institutions of international governance, given the likelihood of future pandemics and other major shocks (e.g., climate).</span>

                    <span>Recent proposals to expand the Child Tax Credit (CTC) are at the center of current policy discussions in the United States. We study the fiscal cost of three such proposals that would expand refundability of the credit to low-income children, increase the maximum credit amount, and/or eliminate the income phase-out to make the credit universal. For each proposal, we use the Current Population Survey to estimate three components of the net fiscal cost: the direct cost (additional tax refunds or lower tax liability), revenue changes due to taxpayers’ labor supply responses, and long-term changes in tax revenue due to changes in children’s future earnings. We find that direct costs are by far the most important component but that long-term earning changes also play an important role, offsetting one-third or more of the direct costs, depending on the proposal and modeling assumptions. In contrast, labor supply responses only modestly contribute to the fiscal cost of CTC expansions.</span>

                    <span>Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity. To study this equity-efficiency trade-off, we contribute a framework in which firms either hire many imperfectly substitutable worker types in-house by posting wages along a job ladder, or rent labor services from contractors who hire in the same frictional labor markets. Three implications arise. First, more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on higher wage premia. Second, outsourcing raises output at the firm level. Third, contractors endogenously locate at the bottom of the job ladder, implying that outsourced workers receive lower wages. Using firm-level instruments for outsourcing and revenue productivity, we find empirical support for all three predictions in French administrative data. After structurally estimating the model, we find that the rise in outsourcing in France between 1996 and 2007 raised aggregate output by 3% and reduced the labor share by 0.7 percentage points. A 9% minimum wage increase stabilizes the labor share and maintains two thirds of the output gains.</span>

From the full text of 800,000 Wall Street Journal articles for 1984–2017, we estimate a topic model that summarizes business news into interpretable topical themes and quantifies the proportion of news attention allocated to each theme over time. News attention closely tracks a wide range of economic activities and explains 25% of aggregate stock market returns. A text-augmented VAR demonstrates the large incremental role of news text in modeling macroeconomic dynamics. We use this model to retrieve the narratives that underlie business cycle fluctuations.</span>

                    <span>Lead poisoning has well-known impacts for the developing brain of young children, with a large literature documenting the negative effects of elevated blood lead levels on academic and behavioral outcomes. In April of 2014, the municipal water source in Flint, Michigan was changed, causing lead from aging pipes to leach into the city’s drinking water. In this study, we use Michigan’s universe of longitudinal, student-level education records, combined with home water service line inspection data containing the location of lead pipes, to empirically examine the effect of the Flint Water Crisis on educational outcomes of Flint public school children. We leverage parallel causal identification strategies, a between-district synthetic control analysis and a within-Flint difference-in-differences analysis, to separate out the direct health effects of lead exposure from the broad effects of living in a community experiencing a crisis. Our results highlight a less well-appreciated consequence of the Flint Water Crisis – namely, the psychosocial effects of the crisis on the educational outcomes of school-age children. These findings suggest that cost estimates which rely only on the negative impact of direct lead exposure substantially underestimate the overall societal cost of the crisis.</span>

                    <span>There are two broad views as to why people stay poor. One emphasizes differences in fundamentals, such as ability, talent or motivation. The other, the poverty traps view, differences in opportunities which stem from access to wealth. To test between these two views, we exploit a large-scale, randomized asset transfer and an 11-year panel on 6000 households who begin in extreme poverty. The setting is rural Bangladesh and the asset is cows. The data supports the poverty traps view - we identify a threshold level of initial assets above which households accumulate assets, take on better occupations (from casual labor in agriculture or domestic services to running small livestock businesses) and grow out of poverty. The reverse happens for those below the threshold. Structural estimation of an occupational choice model reveals that almost all beneficiaries are misallocated in the work they do at baseline and that the gains arising from eliminating misallocation would far exceed the program costs. Our findings imply that large transfers which create better jobs for the poor are an effective means of getting people out of poverty traps and reducing global poverty.</span>

This column reviews the analysis of globalisation and inflation conducted in the context of the ECB strategy review. Although global factors (mainly commodity prices) matter for inflation synchronisation, their role in lowering both inflation and its sensitivity to the business cycle in advanced economies has been limited since the late 1980s. Global shocks can exert temporary pressure on price dynamics, but the destiny of inflation remains in the hands of central banks.</span>

                    <span>Climate change is a defining challenge of our times. This column introduces a special issue of the Journal of Economic Geography on climate change, which provides foundations for well-informed policymaking by addressing two main themes of the economic geography of climate change. First, climate change yields heterogeneous effects across space. Second, a crucial aspect of human adaptation to climate change is geographic mobility. As a consequence, limitations to mobility will worsen the socioeconomic costs of climate change. Other margins of adjustment covered in the issue include fertility, specialisation, and trade.</span>

                    <span>The recent combination of resurging demand and continuing disruptions in supply chains has led to a worrying return of inflation. In the EU, industry producer prices increased by 12.2% year-on-year in July 2021. This column argues that removing EU antidumping duties would at least partially ease the pressure on input and consumer prices. In contrast, the recent abandonment of China’s differential treatment in the EU’s antidumping legislation might even have contributed to increasing import prices.</span>

                    <span>In many countries, poorer people have been more exposed to Covid-19 as they cannot afford to stay at home instead of going to work. This column shows that in low- and middle-income countries, emergency income support schemes have significantly reduced differences in rates of contagion due to wealth or poverty status by allowing poorer people to also stay at home. As well as preserving livelihoods and alleviating poverty, income support has also been successful in curbing the spread of Covid-19.</span>

                    <span>US military spending is said to be greater than the next 11 countries combined. However, the conventional use of market exchange rates to compare across countries dramatically overstates US spending relative to other countries. This column introduces a military purchasing power parity exchange rate for 59 countries based on the relative unit cost ratio across counties. This ‘military PPP’ shows that the US military budget in 2019 was smaller than that of the next three largest military spenders – China, India, and Russia – combined.</span>

                    <span>From the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Rail Time Indicators.  Graphs and excerpts reprinted with permission. 
Rail traffic in September 2021 was a mix of good and could-be-better, reflecting continuing  broad supply chain issues and an economy that doesn’t appear sure where it’s going.
U.S. intermodal volume in September 2021 was down 6.7% from last year and down 0.1% from  September 2019. The smooth functioning of intermodal terminals depends on consistent freight  outflows to make room for new freight inflows. Unfortunately, that’s not happening right now because  of supply chain capacity constraints, with predicable impacts on intermodal. U.S. intermodal in 2021  through September was the second most ever, fractionally behind the first nine months of 2018.

Leisure and hospitality gained 74 thousand jobs in September.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 1.6 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back about 80% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment increased 22 thousand, and manufacturing added 26 thousand jobs.


NOTE: State and Local education lost 161 thousand jobs, seasonally adjusted, versus expectations of a solid gain.  This was a key contributor to the weak job report.

                    <span>From the BLS: 
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 194,000 in September, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 4.8 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported  today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing. Employment in public education declined over the month.
...
The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised up by 38,000, from +1,053,000 to +1,091,000, and the change for August was revised up by 131,000, from +235,000 to +366,000. With  these revisions, employment in July and August combined is 169,000 higher than previously reported.

The first graph shows the year-over-year change in total non-farm employment since 1968.
In September, the year-over-year change was 5.7 million jobs.  This was up significantly year-over-year.
Total payrolls increased by 194 thousand in August.  Private payrolls increased by 317 thousand.
Payrolls for July and August were revised up 169 thousand, combined.
The second graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but currently is not as severe as the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.
The third graph shows the employment population ratio and the participation rate.
The Labor Force Participation Rate was declined to 61.6% in September, from 61.7% in August. This is the percentage of the working age population in the labor force. 
The Employment-Population ratio increased to 58.7% from 58.5% (black line).
I&#x27;ll post the 25 to 54 age group employment-population ratio graph later.
The fourth graph shows the unemployment rate.  
The unemployment rate decreased in September to 4.8% from 5.2% in August. 
This was well below consensus expectations, however July and August were revised up by 169,000 combined.

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of October 5th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Largest Weekly Forbearance Decline in 12 Months
We’ve been waiting for a sizable drop in the number of active forbearance plans, given the large number of plans both marked for either review (for extension/removal) or final expiration in September.
Well, this week has brought the first real signs of that. In fact, according to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the population dropped by 11% since last Tuesday, marking the largest weekly decline in 12 months.
The number of active forbearance plans fell by 177,000 this week with declines seen across all investor classes, led by an 84,000 plan drop among FHA/VA loans. Plans among GSE loans and those held in bank portfolios and private label securities also fell, seeing 50,000 (-11%) and 43,000 (-8%) declines respectively.
As of October 5, 1.39 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 2.6% of all active mortgages, including 1.4% of GSE, 4.3% of FHA/VA and 3.6% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
 Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Overall, forbearances have declined by 294,000 (-17%) over the past 30 days, the fastest monthly rate of improvement since October 2020. Plan exits surged then as the first wave of forbearance entrants reached their six-month mark. The folks who’d remained are now reaching the end of their allowable terms.
There are still more than 180,000 plans with September month-end review dates. Keep in mind that this data only covers the last business day in that month and the first three in October. Additional exits are likely in coming weeks as well as servicers continue to work through the large volumes of expirations.

전국을 뒤덮던 ‘도시재생사업’이 마무리되었거나 종료를 앞두고 있다. 그간 막대한 예산이 투입된 지원사업임에도 불구하고 현장에서는 지원이 종료된 이후의 지속가능성을 두고 고심이 깊다. 그럼 지원사업이 종료되더라도 지역에서 발생하는 다양한 문제를 해결하며 유지, 관리해 갈 방법은 무엇인가. 

주민들이 지역자원을 발굴하고 창업과 일자리를 창출해 지역경제를 활성화하는 도시재생기업이 그 해결책으로 주목받고 있다. 하지만 창업과 일자리 창출은 수많은 변수로 리크스가 크고 두서없이 시작했다가 거듭된 실패로 포기가 속출하는 쉽지 않은 도전이다. 따라서 주민의 창업 성공률을 높이고 기업을 안정궤도에 안착시킬 도구가 필요하다. 도시재생기업을 운영할 주민들의 역량을 강화할 도구로 이 개발되었다.

‘위드 코로나’가 자리 잡고 단계적 일상 회복이 예상되는 2022년의 경제는 ‘회귀점Point of Turning Back’에 진입할 것이다. 모든 지표는 회복 국면에 접어들고 완화적 통화정책은 멈춰질 전망이다. 하지만 선진국과 개도국 간 불균형 회복 시나리오가 예측되는 가운데 세계 경제는 또다시 새로운 변화에 놓여 있다. 국내 경제도 마찬가지다. 양극화로 치닫게 된 계층 간 회복은 ‘K자형 회복’으로 불리며 또 다른 쟁점을 암시한다. 

2022년 반드시 알아야 할 주요한 경제 이슈는 이뿐만이 아니다. 통화정책이 긴축으로 전환됨으로써 자산시장에 미치는 영향은 무엇인지, 테이퍼링 단행과 예고된 금리 인상은 자산 가치를 어떻게 변화시킬 것이며, 디지털 화폐 전쟁과 반도체 신냉전 같은 굵직한 이슈들은 국제 경제에 어떻게 작용할 것인지에 대한 논의도 결코 놓쳐선 안 된다.

이 책은 수많은 쟁점 중 경제 흐름에 주요하게 작용할 20가지 트렌드를 선별했다. 또한 국제기구가 발표한 보고서와 국내외 경제지표라는 정확한 근거로 한 해 전망을 통찰해 담았다. 세계적으로는 인플레이션 공포와 자산 버블 붕괴의 위협, 원자재 가격과 글로벌 통상 환경 변화 등이 이슈겠고, 국내에는 한국판 뉴딜 2.0 예산안과 순환 경제 구축, 가계부채 리스크와 부동산 시장 전망 등이 꼭 짚고 넘어가야 할 현안이라 할 수 있다.

코로나 팬데믹을 겪고 생존을 위한 리셋을 진행하면서 인류는 전에 없던 대변혁을 맞았다. 변화의 파도 속에서 위기가 아닌 기회를 찾고, 지속가능한 생존을 위해 인류는 어떤 준비를 해야 하는 걸까? 지난해《세계미래보고서 2021》 ‘포스트 코로나 특별판’에서는 코로나 팬데믹 이후 찾아올 정치, 경제, 사회, 교육 분야의 변화에 대한 긴급 진단과 전망을 담았다. 

이후 인류 문명은 생각지도 못했던 놀라운 지각변동을 겪기 시작했다. 밀레니엄 프로젝트는 이미 시작된 지각변동, 그리고 이전과는 전혀 다른 방식으로 작동할 세상을 예측하고 그것이 만들어낼 변화상을 《세계미래보고서 2022 : 메타 사피엔스가 온다》를 통해 제시한다. 

인간의 상상력과 기술이 결합해 이전과는 전혀 다른 세상이 펼쳐지고 있으며 인류는 거대한 문명의 패러다임 전환기를 맞고 있다. 이 책에서는 코로나 팬데믹 이후 새롭게 재편된 세상에서 살아갈 신인류를 ‘메타 사피엔스’Meta Sapiens라 지칭한다. 

밀레니엄 프로젝트의 이번 신간은 2005년부터 시작된 《세계미래보고서》시리즈의 최신판으로, 메타 사피엔스가 살아갈 세상의 모습이 어떠한지 예측하기 위해 새로운 문명의 축이 될 6가지 메타 트렌드를 제시한다. 그것은 우주 골드러시의 시대, 로봇과의 동거, AI메타버스, 노화의 종말, 기후 위기 극복, ESG 경영이다.

If so, those outsourced jobs may return. Alessandra Bonfiglioli tells Tim Phillips why there may be reasons to welcome our new robot overlords.

The contributions in a new CEPR eBook aim to identity, for each of the featured nations, which climate change policies will have the fastest and/or largest cumulative impact, and which are the most technically, financially, or politically feasible. Although the low-hanging fruit in climate policy vary across countries, this does not mean that one country cannot learn from the debates taking place in another.</span>

The redesign calls for multinational giants to pay their ‘fair share’ of taxes rather than running off to tax havens. This column argues that as popular as this goal may be, finding practical ways to achieve it remains problematic. Simpler approaches have a better chance of succeeding.</span>

                    <span>The euro area’s economic policy framework was created in the early 1990s, when neutral interest rates were positive and the main risk was excessive inflation. This column argues that today’s world is very different from the 1990s, and thus requires a new  economic policy framework where monetary and fiscal policy can work together effectively to support inflation and growth. The author identifies flaws in the current euro area fiscal framework and suggests how these could be fixed and complemented with a simple, state-contingent fiscal policy rule that achieves the right balance between supporting growth and inflation and ensuring debt sustainability.</span>

                    <span>Note: Since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic, CoStar is comparing to 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Performance Slides in Latest Weekly Data
U.S. hotel performance dipped from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through Oct. 2.
26 September through 2 October 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 61.7% (-9.2%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$130.87 (+1.2%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$80.78 (-8.2%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The Summer months had decent occupancy with solid leisure travel, and occupancy was only off about 7% in July and August compared to 2019.


But it is uncertain what will happen over the next couple of months with business travel.  Usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.</span>

국내 최고의 이코노미스트 홍춘욱 박사가 돈 공부만 28년 한 모든 노하우를 담아 경제 흐름과 부동산, 주식, 투자에 필요한 현실적인 조언, 즉 돈의 흐름을 읽는 법을 담았다. 돈의 주도권을 잡기 위해서 우리는 반드시 돈의 흐름을 읽는 법을 알아야 한다. 홍춘욱 박사는 아들에게 물려줄 부의 유산으로 ‘돈의 흐름을 읽는 법’을 꼽았고, 홍 박사가 가진 돈에 관한 인사이트를 집대성해 불확실한 시대에 나를 지키는 현실적인 투자 방법을 알려주고 있다. 

은행과 증권사의 이코노미스트로, 국민연금공단의 투자 운용 매니저로, 경제·경영학자로 탄탄히 쌓아 올린 저자의 투자 이력은 불확실성이 큰 요즘 같은 코로나 및 저금리 시대에 어떤 길로 나가야 할지 선명한 방향을 제시해준다. 

특히 우리 삶에 큰 영향을 끼치고 있음에도 잘 알지 못하는 세 가지 금융 변수인 ‘금리, 주가, 환율’에 대한 저자의 관록 있는 분석은 경제 흐름을 파악하는 데 많은 도움을 준다. 대중을 위한 경제 해설가로서 최신의 경제 데이터와 이슈가 되는 핵심 쟁점을 놓치지 않고, 실제 세상과 돈에 관한 정보를 통찰력 있게 담아낸 것이 이 책의 가장 큰 특징이다.

                    <span>In January 2015, Germany introduced a uniform minimum wage of €8.50. Many economists and media outlets predicted that this would have dire consequences for the German economy and result in substantial job losses. This column shows that, in fact, the introduction of the minimum wage boosted pay for low-wage workers without lowering their employment prospects. It also prompted a reallocation of staff towards more productive firms. Overall, the minimum wage helped reduce wage inequality while improving the quality of firms operating in the economy.</span>

                    <span>From ADP:
Private sector employment increased by 568,000 jobs from August to September according to the September ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly  distributed to the public each month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by  the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from  ADP’s actual data of those who are on a company’s payroll, measures the change in total nonfarm private  employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis
“The labor market recovery continues to make progress despite a marked slowdown from the 748,000 job  pace in the second quarter,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP. “Leisure and hospitality  remains one of the biggest beneficiaries to the recovery, yet hiring is still heavily impacted by the  trajectory of the pandemic, especially for small firms. Current bottlenecks in hiring should fade as the  health conditions tied to the COVID-19 variant continue to improve, setting the stage for solid job gains in  the coming months.”

  This was well above the consensus forecast of 430,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 460 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in September.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.</span>

내가 만약 2011년에 1달러, 약 1200원을 주고 1비트코인을 구매했다면, 10년 뒤인 2021년 10월에는 얼마가 될까? 코로나19 팬데믹의 영향으로 실물경제가 큰 타격을 받은 와중에도 암호화폐 투자로 큰돈을 벌었다는 이들의 이야기가 들려오고 비트코인이나 이더리움 등이 연일 최고가를 경신한다는 뉴스에, 마음이 복잡하지 않았던 사람이 오히려 드물 것이다. 지금 투자를 하기에는 늦은 것도 같고… 그래서 부질없지만 떠올려보는 질문. 내가 비트코인에 투자했다면 지금 얼마나 벌었을까? 

답을 먼저 말하자면, 10년 전 1200원을 비트코인에 투자했다면 지금 그 투자금은 6000만 원으로 불어났을 것이다. 우와, 굉장하다고? 그렇다. 하지만 여기에는 몇 가지 전제가 있다. 

이 책 《비트코인의 미래》에서 중국 최초의 비트코인 거래소 BTC차이나 경영자였던 바비 C. 리는 비트코인의 원리가 무엇인지, 왜 여기에 투자해야 하며 비트코인이 어떤 근거로 가치를 높여가게 될지 알려준다. “비트코인이야말로 우리 일생일대의 기회임을 믿어 의심치 않는다”고 단언하는 저자는 10년에 걸친 자신의 투자 경험을 바탕으로 독자들이 흔들리지 않고 투자해나갈 수 있는 비결을 선보인다.

백악관 경제자문관을 지낸 제프리 프랑켈 미국 하버드대 케네디스쿨 교수는 ‘2021 G20 글로벌 금융안정 컨퍼런스’에서 “코로나19 경제위기 회복에 대한 기대감으로 상반기까지 폭등했던 부동산·주식·채권·원자재 등 모든 자산가격이 조만간 금세 꺼지면서 새로운 위기의 시발점이 될 것”임을 경고했다. 세계적인 투자 구루 제레미 그랜덤 GMO 자산운용사 회장 역시 “여러 징후가 그 마지막 단계에 와 있다. 

버블은 터지고, 모든 투자자들은 투자 인생에서 가장 공포스러운 이벤트를 경험하게 될 것이다.”라고 조언한 바 있다. 또한 2008년 글로벌 금융위기를 예언해 유명해진 피터 시프 유로퍼시픽캐피탈 CEO는 “다가올 위기는 2008년보다 더욱 심각하다”며 “현재의 경제는 공짜돈으로 겨우 받쳐져 있을 뿐, 우리는 또 다른 금융위기로 가고 있으며 이는 이전보다 훨씬 심각할 것이다.”라고 암울한 전망을 내놓았다.

질비오 게젤은 탁월한 통찰력과 치밀한 사고를 가진 독일 출신의 성공한 사업가이자 경제이론가였다. 게젤의 대표작 는 1900년대 초 자신이 기업을 경영하며 실제로 겪은 경제문제와 사회문제에 대한 고민에서 출발했다. 

이 책에서 게젤은 자본주의에 대한 폭 넓고 깊이 있는 분석을 바탕으로 기존 경제이론가들의 이론을 비판적으로 검토하면서, 자신만의 과감하고도 현실적인 해결방안을 제시하고 있다. 이 책은 수많은 독자들의 호응을 얻었고 여러 나라에 번역 소개되어 후대의 경제학자들에게도 적지 않은 영향을 주었다. 

‘자연스러운 경제질서’란 인간의 본성에 적합하여 인간을 번영시키는 경제질서로서 우리가 도달해야 할 목표이다. 하지만 현재 자본주의는 기술발전에도 불구하고 경기침체, 빈부격차, 실업 등의 문제가 많다. 그 원인은 우리 사회에 만연한 두 가지 불로소득 특권인데, 하나는 토지의 사적소유에서 비롯된 임대료, 또 하나는 화폐의 축장에서 나오는 이자소득이다. 이에 게젤은 이러한 문제의 근본해결을 위해 ‘자유토지’와 ‘자유화폐’의 개념을 구상하여 토지개혁과 화폐개혁을 주장한다.

배달의 민족, 넷플릭스, 왓챠 등 사용자 맞춤 AI기술이 자연스럽게 사용되는 시대. 우리는 이제 문과, 이과, 남녀노소 가릴 것 없이 코딩을 자연스럽게 배워야한다. 하지만 남들 다 하는 파이썬, 자바, HTML 같은 것들보다 자신만의 차별점을 가지고 싶다면, 를 통해 어렵지만 더 과감한 c언어에 도전하길 바란다.

는 활발하게 코딩 교육을 가르치고 있는 이창현 저자가 쓴 두 번째 코딩 독학 시리즈이다. 다수의 예제와 일러스트, 만화 등을 사용하여 c언어를 좀 더 친숙하게 이해할 수 있도록 집필하였다. 그리고 c언어의 가장 고난이도 명령어인 ‘포인터’를 쉽게 설명하기 위해 충분한 공을 들였다.

                    <span>Since the financial crisis of 2007/08, bank equity regulation has been tightened. This is one reason why broad money supply reacted only weakly to the enormous expansion of the monetary base. With the publication of a new CEPR Policy Insight, this updated column from February 2021 argues that the process of tightening bank equity regulation has come to an end and will not have the same disinflationary effects after the pandemic. The large reserve balances held by banks may become a greater concern and pose larger inflation risks in the years to come.</span>

                    <span>Some see cryptocurrencies as a potential substitute for fiat money and commercial banking, a new form of exchange resistant to debasement and censorship by governments and financial institutions. This column examines whether cryptocurrency investors are motivated by distrust in fiat currencies or regulated finance, and finds that investors show no differences from the general population in their level of security concerns about either cash or commercial banking services. Cryptocurrency investors tend to be educated and young and to be digital natives. In recent years, a gap in ownership of cryptocurrencies across genders has emerged.</span>

Lumber was at $645 per 1000 board feet this morning.  


This is down from a peak of $1,733, and up from $557 a year ago.

Lumber price are up 15% year-over-year.

There were supply constraints over the last year, for example, sawmills cut production and inventory at the beginning of the pandemic, and the West Coast fires in 2020 damaged privately-owned timberland (and maybe again in 2021).  


The supply constraints have eased somewhat.


And there was a huge surge in demand for lumber (demand remains strong).</span>

Note that they are only raising the “limit” from $548,250 (low cost areas) to $625,000. That is a 14% increase, and the FHFA will probably increase the limit closer to 18% (like to around $645,000 or so).</span>

                    <span>(Posted with permission).  The September ISM® Services index was at 61.9%, up from 61.7% last month. The employment index decreased to 53.0%, from 53.7%.  Note: Above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction. 
From the Institute for Supply Management: Services PMI® at 61.9%, September 2021 Services ISM® Report On Business® 
Economic activity in the services sector grew in September for the 16th month in a row, say the nation’s purchasing and supply executives in the latest Services ISM® Report On Business®.
The report was issued today by Anthony Nieves, CPSM, C.P.M., A.P.P., CFPM, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management® (ISM®) Services Business Survey Committee: “The Services PMI® registered 61.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than the reading of 61.7 percent in August. The September reading indicates the 16th straight month of growth for the services sector, which has expanded for all but two of the last 140 months.
“The Supplier Deliveries Index registered 68.8 percent, down 0.8 percentage point from August’s reading of 69.6 percent. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM® Report On Business® index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Prices Index registered 77.5 percent, up 2.1 percentage points from the August figure of 75.4 percent.”
   
Nieves continues, “According to the Services PMI®, 17 services industries reported growth. The composite index indicated growth for the 16th consecutive month after a two-month contraction in April and May 2020. The slight uptick in the rate of expansion in the month of September continued the current period of strong growth for the services sector. However, ongoing challenges with labor resources, logistics, and materials are affecting the continuity of supply.”
   emphasis added
This was above the consensus forecast,  however the employment index decreased slightly to 53.0%, from 53.7% the previous month.</span>

Exports increased and imports increased in August. 
Exports are up 23% compared to August 2020; imports are up 21% compared to August 2020.
Both imports and exports decreased sharply due to COVID-19, and have now bounced back (imports  more than exports),
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit, with and without petroleum.

From CoreLogic: Record-High Repeat: U.S. Annual Home Price Growth Reaches a New All-Time High in August, CoreLogic Reports
CoreLogic® ... released the CoreLogic Home Price Index (HPI™) and HPI Forecast™ for August 2021.
Home prices rose to a fever pitch this summer, with annual price gains reaching another all-time high in August at 18.1%. Ongoing affordability challenges within the supply-constricted market have also been exacerbated by an influx in homebuying activity from investors. As the home purchase market continues to boom and buoy the post-pandemic economy, these market factors …</span>

Mortgage rates are unchanged to a hair lower compared to last Friday, depending on the lender.  While that&#x27;s welcome news given some of the big jumps in rates seen in the past 2 weeks, the underlying bond market suggests we&#x27;re still in the middle of a waiting game.   [30 year fixed 3.09%]

우리가 흔히 착각하기 쉬운 것이 억만장자 중에는 대학 중퇴자들이 많다는 것이다. 물론 어느 정도 일리는 있다. 하지만 그렇다고 학업을 중단하면 억만장자가 되는 것은 아니다. 억만장자가 된 원인은 다른 데 있기 때문이다. 원인과 결과 사이의 관계를 가리켜 인과라고 한다. 그런데 인과가 증명되지 않은 모든 관찰과 지식은 헛된 것이다. 

가장 대표적인 예가 바로 상관이다. 여자 치마 길이와 아이스크림 판매량 사이에는 강한 음의 상관관계가 존재한다. 치마 길이가 짧아질수록 아이크림 판매량이 늘어난다. 그렇지만 그렇다고 해서 치마 길이는 짧게 만들면 아이스크림이 더 팔린다고 할 수는 없다. 그러나 현실 세계에서 우리는 착시를 하듯 상관관계를 인과관계로 착각할 때가 많다. 이 책은 우리가 자주 착각하는 평균과 상관의 한계와 더불어 진짜 인과를 친절하게 설명해준다.

들어가는 말 인과가 평균이나 상관보다 중요하다	

1장 평균: 실체 없는 우상에 지나지 않는다

1 왜 천문가들은 평균을 계산하려 했을까	 	
산술평균은 편차가 크지 않은 측정값들을 대표한다 / 중점값을 산술평균이라고 부르는 경우도 흔했다 

2 평균의 또 다른 기원은 무엇이었을까	
영어에서 평균의 어원은 손실을 뜻하는 단어다 / 애버리지는 실재하지 않는 허구의 평균이다 

3 왜 지도 제작자는 항로 측정에 중앙값을 추천했을까	 
중앙값은 순서상 한가운데 위치하는 값이다 / 최빈값은 가장 높은 빈도로 측정된 값이다 

4 사물의 평균을 내듯이 인간의 평균을 낼 수 있을까 
케틀레는 천문가의 평균방법을 사람에 적용했다 / 인간 정신의 평균을 구할 수 있을까  
 
5 평균인은 위대하고 선하고 아름다울까 
평균인은 우월하고 비평균인은 열등할까 / 평균적 조종사에 맞춰진 조종석은 무엇이 문제일까 
 
6 누구나 평균적으로 1인당 국민소득만큼 벌까
1인당 국민소득이 늘면 모두에게 좋을까 / 1인당 국민소득으로 경제 수준을 평가할 수 있을까 
 
7 평균적 투기자는 시장의 평균수익률을 얻을까	 	
주식시장의 평균수익률을 어떻게 구할까 / 주식 투기자의 몇 퍼센트가 평균수익률을 앞설까 
 
8 왜 평균에 의존한 의사결정은 평균적으로 잘못될까	 
기업이 평균 수요량으로 계획하면 수익이 날까 / 평균 이익률이 높으면 수익성이 높을까 

2장 상관 : 배후 원리 없이 현상의 묘사에 그친다

1 상관계수에는 평균과 똑같은 문제가 있다	 
상관계수는 어떻게 계산하는가 / 상관계수도 평균의 한 종류다

2 왜 우생학은 상관에 관심을 가졌을까 
상관의 원조는 우생학자 프랜시스 골턴이다 / 부모와 자녀의 키 사이에는 상관이 존재한다 

3 학력과 소득 사이에는 어떠한 관계가 있을까 	
학력이 높을수록 중위소득이 올라간다 / 같은 학력 내 소득 차이가 더 결정적이다 

4 국가 지능지수가 높으면 개인의 소득이 오를까 
지능지수가 높으면 연 소득도 높을까 / 국가 지능지수는 1인당 국민소득과 어떠한 관계를 갖는가 

5 왜 금융시장은 상관계수를 중요하게 여길까

거대한 흐름이 아시아를 향하고 있다. 혁신과 스타트업, 4차 산업혁명이 화두가 된 이래 아시아에는, 특히 동남아에는 거센 변화의 바람이 불었다. 모바일 기반의 혁신적인 서비스들이 곳곳에서 생겨났고, 작은 스타트업들이 거대한 유니콘(기업가치 10억 달러 이상), 데카콘(기업가치 100억 달러 이상)으로 성장하며 경제와 시장의 지형을 바꿔놓고 있다.

이 책은  6억 7000만의 거대한 아세안 시장을 움직이며 디지털 경제의 판을 흔들고 있는 대표적인 빅테크 기업, 이른바 ‘슈퍼앱 5(그랩, 고젝, SEA, 라인, VNG)’를 본격적으로 다룬 최초의 책이다. 이들 ‘슈퍼앱’에 대한 이해 없이는 동남아 시장의 중요성과 미래를 읽을 수 없다. 

서울대 사회과학연구원의 선임연구원이자 말레이시아 썬웨이대학의 경영대 교수인 고영경 저자는 이 분야의 독보적인 전문가답게 오랜 현지 연구 경험을 바탕으로 슈퍼앱의 성장과 아세안 경제의 미래에 관한 날카로운 통찰과 혜안을 제시한다.

This column examines the extent to which financing barriers affect productivity outcomes in intangible-intensive sectors, using sector- and firm-level data. The authors demonstrate the existence of a ‘financing gap’ which depresses aggregate productivity growth and resilience, and propose a set of policy options to make each source of external finance – government support, equity financing, and bank credit – more supportive of intangible investment.</span>

                    <span>When managing financial imbalances, macroprudential policymakers face an intertemporal trade-off between facilitating short-term expected growth and containing medium-term downside risks to the economy. To help assess this trade-off, this column proposes a risk management framework which extends the well-known notion of growth-at-risk to consider the entire predictive real GDP growth distribution. The authors use a novel empirical model fitted to euro area data to study the direct and indirect interactions between financial vulnerabilities, financial stress, and real GDP growth, highlighting a number of key findings.</span>

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of October 1st, inventory was at 428 thousand (7 day average), compared to 563 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.9%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55% from 955 thousand.


A week ago, inventory was at 433 thousand, and was down 23.8% YoY.   Four weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far).


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February).  Now inventory may have peaked for the year.   Inventory was about 39.7% above the record low in early April.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for October.</span>

                    <span>The BEA released the Personal Income and Outlays, August 2021 report on Friday.   The report showed that government transfer payments were still almost $770 billion (on SAAR basis) above the February 2020 level (pre-pandemic)  Note: Seasonal adjustment doesn&#x27;t make sense with one time payments, but that is how the data is presented.  

This table shows the amount of unemployment insurance and &quot;Other&quot; transfer payments since January 2020 (pre-crisis level).  The increase in &quot;Other&quot; was mostly due to parts of the relief acts including direct payments.

Note: Not in the table below, but Social Security and Medicare payments haven&#x27;t increased significantly from the pre-recession levels.  Social Security increased from $1,065 billion SAAR in Jan 2020 to $1,117 billion SAAR in August 2021.  Medicare increased from $807 billion to $826 billion.  Medicaid increased significantly from $603 billion to $759 billion.


But most of the increase in transfer payments - compared to the levels prior to the crisis - is from unemployment insurance and &quot;other&quot; (includes direct payments).

Black Knight released their Mortgage Monitor report for August today.

Black Knight also reported that 0.27% of mortgages were in the foreclosure process, down from 0.35% a year ago.
This gives a total of 4.27% delinquent or in foreclosure.

                    <span>Identification in VARs has traditionally mainly relied on second moments. Some researchers have considered using higher moments as well, but there are concerns about the strength of the identification obtained in this way. In this paper, we propose refining existing identification schemes by augmenting sign restrictions with a requirement that rules out shocks whose higher moments significantly depart from independence. This approach does not assume that higher moments help with identification; it is robust to weak identification. In simulations we show that it controls coverage well, in contrast to approaches that assume that the higher moments deliver point-identification. However, it requires large sample sizes and/or considerable non-normality to reduce the width of confidence intervals by much. We consider some empirical applications.  We find that it can reject many possible rotations. The resulting confidence sets for impulse responses may be non-convex, corresponding to disjoint parts of the space of rotation  matrices. We show that in this case, augmenting sign and magnitude restrictions with an independence requirement can yield bigger gains.</span>

                    <span>The minimum wage is increasingly viewed as an important tool for improving public health outcomes, including reducing childbearing among teenagers. Taken at face value, recently reported estimates suggest that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour could reduce the number of teenage births by 35,000 per year. Using an event study framework that accounts for dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects, we find little evidence that minimum wages are causally related to teenage childbearing. Moreover, the estimated effects of minimum wages on teenage sexual behaviors, including contraception use, abstinence, and number of partners are consistently small and statistically insignificant.</span>

                    <span>Supply chain disruptions, which have become commonplace, are often associated with globalization and trade. Little is known about optimal policy in the face of insecure supply chains. Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply? Should they encourage firms to source from closer and presumably safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a very simple model of production with a single critical input and with exogenous risks of relationship-specific and country-wide supply disturbances. We follow Matsuyama and Ushchev (2020) in positing a class of preferences that are homothetic with a single aggregator and that obey Marshall&#x27;s Second Law of Demand. The familiar case of CES preferences is a member of the class, but it imposes restrictions that are important for policy conclusions.We find that, in the CES case, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum and dominates a policy that promotes reshoring or offshoring. When the demand elasticity rises with price, two policy instruments generally are needed to achieve efficient supply chains, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive, and policy that alter incentives to invest at home versus abroad may achieve greater welfare than ones that encourage or discourage diversification.</span>

                    <span>In this article, we review a growing empirical literature on the effectiveness and fairness of the US pretrial system and discuss its policy implications. Despite the importance of this stage of the criminal legal process, researchers have only recently begun to explore how the pretrial system balances individual rights and public interests. We describe the empirical challenges that have prevented progress in this area and how recent work has made use of new data sources and quasi-experimental approaches to credibly estimate both the individual harms (such as loss of employment or government assistance) and public benefits (such as preventing non-appearance at court and new crimes) of cash bail and pretrial detention. These new data and approaches show that the current pretrial system imposes substantial short- and long-term economic harms on detained defendants in terms of lost earnings and government assistance, while providing little in the way of decreased criminal activity for the public interest. Non-appearances at court do significantly decrease for detained defendants, but the magnitudes cannot justify the economic harms to individuals observed in the data. A second set of studies shows that these costs of cash bail and pretrial detention are disproportionately borne by Black and Hispanic individuals, giving rise to large and unfair racial differences in cash bail and detention that cannot be explained by underlying differences in pretrial misconduct risk. We then turn to policy implications and describe areas of future work that would enable a deeper understanding of what drives these undesirable outcomes.</span>

                    <span>We review the literature on the empirical characteristics of the global financial cycle and associated stylized facts on international capital flows, asset prices, risk aversion and liquidity in the financial system. We analyse the co-movements of global factors in asset prices and capital flows with commodity prices, international trade and world output as well as the sensitivity of different parts of the world to the Global Financial Cycle.  We present evidence of the causal effects of the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and of the People&#x27;s Bank of China on the Global Financial Cycle.  We then assess whether the 2008 financial crisis has altered the transmission channels of monetary policies on the Global Financial Cycle. Finally, we discuss the theoretical modelling of the Global Financial Cycle and avenues for future research.</span>

                    <span>This paper employs high frequency transactions data on the world’s oldest and most extensive centralized peer-to-peer Bitcoin market, which enables trade in the currencies of more than 135 countries.  We develop an algorithm that allows, with high probability, the detection of “crypto vehicle transactions” in which crypto currency is used to move capital across borders or facilitate domestic transactions. In contrast to previous work which has used “on-chain” data, our approach enables one to investigate parts of the vastly larger pool of “off-chain” transactions. We find that, as a conservative lower bound, over 7 percent of the 45 million trades on the exchange we explore represent crypto vehicle transactions in which Bitcoin is used to make payment in fiat currency.  Roughly 20 percent of these represent international capital flight/flows/remittances.  Although our work cannot be used to put a price on cryptocurrencies, it provides the first systematic quantitative evidence that the transactional use of cryptocurrencies constitutes a fundamental component of their value, at least under the current regulatory regime.</span>

                    <span>We analyze the diffusion of rival information in a social network. In our model, rational agents can share information sequentially, unconstrained by an exogenous protocol or timing. We show how to compute the set of eventually informed agents for any network, and show that it is essentially unique under altruistic preferences. The relationship between network structure and information diffusion is complex because the former shapes both the charity and confidentiality of potential senders and receivers.</span>

                    <span>Corporate culture is an omnibus term that includes many elements like norms, values, knowledge, and customs that are relevant to a firm. Economists have made great progress recently in devising methods of measuring different aspects of corporate culture. These empirical measures of culture have explained mergers and acquisitions, corporate risk-taking, and unethical behaviors observed in corporations, among other topics. We argue that unpacking corporate culture into its components is the right way to research it empirically. Theories of corporate culture are still in development, and we discuss the major contributions thus far. We argue that a theory of the firm and of corporate decision-making that is based on corporate culture is more germane to the practical realities of firms’ inner workings than prevailing theories based on agency costs. Corporate culture has the potential to set the theoretical paradigm for all corporate finance research.</span>

                    <span>Personal experiences of economic outcomes, from global financial crises to individual-level job losses, can shape individual beliefs, risk attitudes, and choices for years to come. A growing literature on experience effects shows that individuals act as if past outcomes that they experienced were overly likely to occur again, even if they are fully informed about the actual likelihood. This reaction to past experiences is long-lasting though it decays over time as individuals accumulate new experiences. Modern brain science helps understand these processes. Evidence on neuroplasticity reveals that personal experiences and learning alter the strength of neural connections and fine-tune the brain structure to those past experiences (&quot;use-dependent brain&quot;). I show that experience effects help understand belief formation and decision-making in a wide area of economic applications, including inflation, home purchases, mortgage choices, and consumption expenditures. I argue that experience-based learning is broadly applicable to economic decision-making and discuss topics for future research in education, health, race, and gender economics.</span>

These outsized firms compete as oligopolists in a domestic and foreign market, facing competitive pressure from single-product firms that engage in monopolistic competition. The multinational enterprises invest in R&amp;D in order to expand the span of their products and in foreign direct investment (FDI) in order to expand the range of products manufactured by their foreign affiliates. We study the dynamic evolution of these markets and characterize transition dynamics and steady states. In addition to the evolution of product spans, we characterize the evolution of prices, markups, market shares, and exports relative to subsidiary sales. Furthermore, we study comparative dynamics that result from changes in trade costs, R&amp;D costs, the cost of FDI and productivity changes of the multinational firms.</span>

However, population sorting and other confounders make it difficult to disentangle the effects of place on health from other geographic differences in life expectancy. Recent studies have overcome such challenges to demonstrate that place of residence substantially influences health and mortality. Whether policies that encourage people to move to places that are better for their health or that improve areas that are detrimental to health are desirable depends on the mechanisms behind place effects, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood.</span>

                    <span>We document the existence of a racial gap in realized housing returns that is an order of magnitude larger than disparities arising from housing costs alone, and is driven almost entirely by differences in distressed home sales (i.e. foreclosures and short sales). Black and Hispanic homeowners are both more likely to experience a distressed sale and to live in neighborhoods where distressed sales erase more house value. Importantly, absent financial distress, houses owned by minorities do not appreciate at slower rates than houses owned by non-minorities. Racial differences in income stability and liquid wealth explain a large share of the differences in distress. We use quasi-experimental variation in loan modifications to show that policies that restructure mortgages for distressed minorities can increase housing returns and reduce the racial wealth gap.</span>

                    <span>I examine the effects of occupational licensing on the quality of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs). I exploit the staggered adoption of the 150-hour rule, which increases the educational requirements for a CPA license. The analysis shows that the rule decreases the number of entrants into the profession, reducing both low- and high-quality candidates. Labor market proxies for quality find no difference between 150-hour rule CPAs and the rest. Moreover, rule CPAs exit public accounting at similar rates and have comparable writing quality to their non-rule counterparts. Overall, these findings are consistent with the theoretical argument that increases in licensing requirements restrict the supply of entrants and do little to improve quality in the labor market.</span>

This study complements the many CO2 enrichment experiments that have found important interactions between CO2 and local environmental conditions in controlled settings.  We use three empirical strategies: (i) a panel of CO2 anomalies and county yields, (ii) a panel of spatial first-differences between neighboring counties, and (iii) a cross-sectional spatial first-difference. We find consistently high fertilization effects: a 1 ppm increase in CO2 equates to a 0.5%, 0.6%, and 0.8% yield increase for corn, soybeans, and wheat, respectively. Viewed retrospectively, 10%, 30%, and 40% of each crop&#x27;s yield improvements since 1940 are attributable to rising CO2.</span>

                    <span>Free trade or preferential trade areas (PTAs) allow importers who belong to the area to export to each other while paying zero or preferential tariffs as long as Rules of Origin (ROOs) are met. Meeting them is costly not only in terms of production costs but also in terms of documentation costs. We ask if these fixed costs of documentation change over time with the experience of the firm in obtaining preferential tariffs. We explore this using a unique importer-exporter matched transaction-level customs data set on a group of Latin American countries. Our estimating equation is model-based and shows that these fixed costs depend on the history of preference utilization. Most of the effect comes from experience in the same product and same partner, with some spillover to other partners buying the same product. There is little learning from experience in other products and other partners. When considering products that have been under preferences for a while, some learning might have occurred prior to the start of our data. Using a natural experiment in Argentina, where some products were newly brought under preferences, we show that learning is indeed larger for such products. As facilitating preference use today also makes it easier to use preferences in the future, interventions early on in the life of the FTA to reduce such costs would be more effective.</span>

                    <span>This paper finds strong support for a Phillips curve that becomes nonlinear when inflation is “low”—which our baseline model defines as less than 3 percent. The nonlinear curve is steep when output is above potential (slack is negative), but flat when output is below potential (slack is positive), so that further increases in economic slack have little effect on inflation. This finding is consistent with evidence of downward nominal wage and price rigidity. When inflation is high, the Phillips curve is linear and relatively steep. These results are robust to placing the threshold between the high and low inflation regimes at 2, 3, or 4 percent inflation or for a threshold based on country-specific medians of inflation. In this nonlinear model, international factors play a large role in explaining headline inflation (albeit less so for core inflation), a role that has been increasing since the global financial crisis.</span>

                    <span>We develop a unified framework to trace value added along global supply chains in the presence of foreign direct investment by decomposing either GDP based on forward linkages or final production based on backward linkages. The new framework accounts for the presence of foreign invested enterprises (FIEs), their interactions with local firms in the host countries as well as their activities in international trade. The size of the GVC activities identified with this framework roughly doubles that in the previous literature that treats FIEs the same as local firms. The “missing GVC activities” are more serious for high-tech sectors than for those with a lower R&amp;D intensity, and more serious for high-income economies than for middle-income economies.</span>

                    <span>Virtually all theories of economic growth predict a positive relationship between population size and productivity. In this paper I study a particular historical episode to provide direct evidence for the empirical relevance of such scale effects. In the aftermath of the Second World War about 8m ethnic Germans were expelled from their domiciles in Eastern Europe and transferred to West Germany. This inflow increased the German population by almost 20%. Using variation across counties I show that the settlement of refugees had a large and persistent effect on the size of the local population, manufacturing employment and income per capita. I show that these findings are quantitatively consistent with an idea-based model of spatial growth if population mobility is subject to frictions and productivity spillovers occur locally. The model implies that the refugee settlement increased aggregate income per capita by about 12% after 25 years and that the historical settlement rule triggered persistent industrialization of rural areas.</span>

                    <span>Do changes in government spending affect voluntary contributions to those recipients? We examine how changes in K-12 education budgets impact donations to teachers using data from DonorsChoose.org, an online crowdfunding platform for public school teachers to raise money for their classrooms. Using a district-year panel and instruments to address the endogeneity of budgets, we find evidence for crowd-out of private giving, though the magnitudes are fairly small in this setting and do not offset a large proportion of a budget change. These results are driven by entirely teachers&#x27; posting of requests, illustrating the importance of considering the demand side of the charitable giving market.</span>

                    <span>Are teenage and adult smoking causally related?  Recent anti-tobacco policy is predicated on the assumption that preventing teenagers from smoking will ensure that fewer adults smoke, but direct evidence in support of this assumption is scant.  Using data from three nationally representative sources and cigarette taxes experienced as a teenager as an instrument, we document a strong, positive relationship between teenage and adult smoking: specifically, deterring 10 teenagers from smoking through raising cigarette taxes roughly translates into 5 or 6 fewer eventual adult smokers.  We conclude that efforts to reduce teenage smoking can have important, long-lasting consequences on smoking participation and, presumably, health.</span>

                    <span>Based on archival and survey data we show that the maturity of U.S. business loans has been continuously increasing since the mid-1930s when banks invented the term loan. Concurrently, bank innovation first involved the invention of credit analysis and covenant design. Later, bank innovation included the advent of loan sales, increased loan syndications, the opening of the leveraged loan market, and the securitization of loans in collateralized loan obligations. We estimate and calibrate a model of bank innovation to determine the quantitative contribution of bank innovation to economic growth.</span>

                    <span>We construct a model of creative destruction with endogenous firm dynamics. We integrate the theory into a general equilibrium multi-country model of technological convergence where countries interact via international spillovers. We derive implications for both firm dynamics and aggregate productivity dynamics. In richer economies, firms are on average larger and the best firms grow larger over time. In poorer economies, there is little creative destruction, low selection, and firms remain small. We estimate the parameters of the model using firm-level data for India and the United States. We study the effect of counterfactual policy reforms. Industrial policy that selectively targets the more productive firms can be beneficial in poor countries while being harmful in countries close to the economic frontier. The findings echo Acemoglu et al. (2006).</span>

                    <span>It is now established that mortality and excess mortality from COVID-19 differed across racial and ethnic groups in 2020. Less is known about educational differences in mortality during the pandemic. We examine mortality rates by BA status within sex, age, and race/ethnic groups comparing 2020 with 2019. Mortality rates have increasingly differed by BA status in the US in recent years and there are good reasons to expect the gap to have widened further during the pandemic. Using publicly available provisional data from the National Center for Health Statistics we find that mortality rates increased in 2020 over 2019 for those with and without a BA, irrespective of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Although mortality rates increased by more for those without a BA, the ratio of mortality rates for those with and without a BA changed surprisingly little from 2019 to 2020. Among 60 groups (sex by race/ethnicity by age) that are available in the data, the ratio of mortality rates of those without a BA to those with a BA fell for more than half of the groups. Our results suggest that differences in the risk of infection were less important in structuring mortality by education than differences in the risk of death conditional on infection.</span>

This column uses microsimulations of household behaviour from UK data to investigate the efficiency and equity impacts of different ways of recycling carbon tax revenue, focusing on both horizontal and vertical equity dimensions, and their implications for political feasibility. The authors find that rebating carbon tax revenues through social security payments renders the policy progressive and benefits the highest share of households in their sample.</span>

                    <span>In turbulent times, trust in our central banks is important. This column uses the survey data on consumer expectations to gauge trust in the ECB during the Covid-19 pandemic. The authors find that trust in the ECB depends on consumers’ financial knowledge and on how severely they are affected by the pandemic, and that this trust and financial knowledge both contribute to better anchoring of consumers’ inflation expectations around the ECB’s inflation target.  Possible routes to improve trust include activities that enhance financial knowledge, tailoring central bank communication in terms of content and targeting it at people with low trust.</span>

                    <span>The key report this week is the September employment report on Friday.
Other key indicators include the September ISM Services index and the August trade deficit.
----- Monday, October 4th -----
No major economic releases scheduled.
----- Tuesday, October 5th -----
8:00 AM ET: Corelogic House Price index for August
8:30 AM: Trade Balance report for August from the Census Bureau.  The consensus is for the deficit to be $70.5 billion in August, from $70.1 billion in July.
This graph shows the U.S. trade deficit, with and without petroleum, through the most recent report.  The blue line is the total deficit, and the black line is the petroleum deficit, and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products.
10:00 AM: the ISM Services Index for September.
----- Wednesday, October 6th -----
7:00 AM ET: The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) will release the results for the mortgage purchase applications index.
8:15 AM: The ADP Employment Report for September. This report is for private payrolls only (no government).  The consensus is for 430,000 jobs added, up from 374,000 in August.
----- Thursday, October 7th -----
8:30 AM: The initial weekly unemployment claims report will be released.  The consensus is for 345 thousand initial claims, down from 362 thousand last week.
----- Friday, October 8th -----
8:30 AM: Employment Report for September.   The consensus is for 460 thousand jobs added, and for the unemployment rate to decrease to 5.1%.
There were 235 thousand jobs added in August, and the unemployment rate was at 5.2%.
This graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but currently is not as severe as the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.</span>

                    <span>The past three decades have witnessed reform efforts to contain pension expenditures, the cost of which is born mostly by younger generations. This column assesses the sustainability, fairness, and intergenerational equity of pension systems in Europe by comparing the pension contributions and benefits over the lifetime of different cohorts. Reforms legislated in the decade from the onset of the Global Crisis reduced the lifetime benefit-contribution ratio by nearly 25% for younger generations. However, subsequent policy reversals have partly eroded these gains, suggesting additional reforms are needed.</span>

This graph shows light vehicle sales since 2006 from the BEA (blue) and Wards Auto&#x27;s estimate for September (red).
The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
After April 2020, sales increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic).  


However, sales have decreased recently due to supply issues.</span>

Excerpt: 
An analysis from CoreLogic today suggests “Nearly three-in-four loans in forbearance are expected to reach the 18-month maximum limit at the end of September.”
...
In Forbearance Will Not Lead to a Huge Wave of Foreclosures, I presented some data from Black Knight and argued “that most homeowners in forbearance have sufficient equity in their homes, and there will not be a huge wave of foreclosures like following the housing bubble.” But there will be some increase in foreclosure activity. I’ll track the data over the next few months, but this isn’t a huge concern.</span>

                    <span>Here is a table of some of the forecasts over the last two months.  The significant downgrades during the quarter were primarily due to analysts initially underestimating the recent COVID wave, and also the impact of supply chain disruptions.

2020~2021년은 팬데믹의 해였다. 모든 트렌드의 주도권을 코로나와 팬데믹이 가졌다고 해도 과언이 아닌 시기였다. 아직 다 끝나지 않았지만 2022년은 확실히 다르다. 주도권을 다시 우리가 가져올 때다. 2019년까지 누렸던 익숙한 일상으로의 복귀를 2020~2021년에 외쳐 왔다면 이제는 일상 복귀(Back to Normal)가 아니라 새로운 일상을 외칠 때다. 

2022년은 2020~2021년처럼 뉴 노멀(New Normal)에 적응하느라 급급한 때가 아니라 적극적으로 베터 노멀 라이프(Better Normal Life)를 욕망하는 해다. 과거로 돌아가는 것이 아니라 팬데믹을 거치면서 바뀐 우리의 욕망, 사회, 비즈니스 등을 흡수한 채 더 나은 일상을 찾고자 한다. 

우리는 더 합리적이고 효율적으로, 더 즐겁고 행복할 방법을 찾고자 한다. 이미 사회, 경제, 산업 등이 바뀐 상태인데 팬데믹이 종식되었다고 해서 바뀐 것이 리셋될 리 없다. 결국 익숙하던 과거의 일상에 좀 더 나아진 새로운 일상이 결합될 수밖에 없다.

                    <span>The approval of several effective covid vaccines in record time shifted the emphasis in rich countries away from availability and the logistics of delivery to the issue of vaccine hesitancy. This column looks at vaccination rates across countries, with a special focus on the French experience. It finds that the introduction of a ‘corona pass’ had a much greater impact on France’s vaccination rate than it did in some other countries, possibly in part due to the way it was announced by President Macron.</span>

                    <span>Since the Great Financial Crisis, bail-in has been introduced as an approach to address too-big-to-fail and contagion risk problems. This column uses a multi-layered network model of the European financial system to study the implication of bail-in design on financial stability. It shows that early implementation of a bail-in and stronger bank recapitalisation lead to lower contagion losses. However, current bail-in design seems to be in the region of instability and the political economy of incentives makes reforms unlikely in the near future.</span>

                    <span>Scapegoating refers to a social phenomenon whereby members of an aggrieved majority group retaliate against innocent third parties, usually members of vulnerable minority groups. This column uses an experiment set up between May and September 2017 in Eastern Slovakia – where a large Roma minority regularly suffers from discrimination – to measure how an injustice that affects a member of one’s own group shapes the punishment of an unconnected bystander (or scapegoat). The experiment shows that members of a majority group will systematically shift punishment onto innocent members of an ethnic minority.</span>

                    <span>Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family Serious Delinquency decreased to 1.79% in August, from 1.94% in July. The serious delinquency rate is down from 3.32% in August 2020.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
Click on graph for larger image
By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 4.47% are seriously delinquent (down from 4.82% in July).  For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 7.57% are seriously delinquent (down from 8.26%),  For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.46% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.57%). So Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once they are employed.

CAMELS is the FDIC rating system, and stands for Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to market risk. The scale is from 1 to 5, with 1 being the strongest.

With the Delta variant of the COVID virus spiking during the month, August visitation receded from the pandemic‐era peak in July, coming in at just under 3.0M visitors, down ‐ 9.2% MoM and down ‐16.2% from August 2019.
Hotel occupancy reached 72.8% for the month (down 6.6 pts MoM, down ‐14.9 pts vs. August 2019), as Weekend occupancy remained fairly strong at 87.1% (down ‐1.0 pts MoM) while Midweek occupancy dipped to 67.8% (down ‐6.8 pts MoM).
Although down from July, August ADR was the second highest in the pandemic era, exceeding $140, down ‐7.8% MoM but up 16.0% vs. August 2019. RevPAR came in at $102, ‐15.4% MoM and down ‐3.7% vs. August 2019.

U.S. hotel occupancy remained relatively flat week over week, while average daily rate rose, according to STR‘s latest data through September 25.
September 19-25, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 63.2% (-11.0%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $133.69 (-2.0%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $84.54 (-12.8%)
A week after eclipsing 1 million for the first time since the earliest days of the pandemic, group demand rose again to almost 1.3 million for the week. At the same time, group ADR moved past $200 for the first time since February 2020.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The Summer months had decent occupancy with solid leisure travel, and occupancy was only off about 7% in July and August compared to 2019.


But it is uncertain what will happen over the next couple of months with business travel.  Usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.</span>

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2021, according to the &quot;third&quot; estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the first quarter, real GDP increased 6.3 percent.
The &quot;third&quot; estimate of GDP released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the &quot;second&quot; estimate issued last month. In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was 6.6 percent. Upward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, and private inventory investment were partly offset by an upward revision to imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP
emphasis added
Here is a Comparison of Third and Second Estimates.  PCE growth was revised up from 11.9% to 12.0%. Residential investment was revised down from -11.5% to -11.7%. This was at the consensus forecast.</span>

                    <span>Covid-19 has further exposed the growing interdependence between advanced economies and emerging markets. Most of the existing research on cross-border spillovers has focused on the spillover effects from advanced economies to emerging markets. This column shows that spillovers from emerging markets to advanced economies over the past 25 years are about a fifth of those running in the opposite direction, and have increased significantly over time because of the evolving interdependence between these blocks.</span>

                    <span>Job retention schemes during the pandemic prioritised preservation over reallocation, but evidence on their allocative and productivity consequences is scarce. Using tax data for Australia, this column shows that job reallocation and firm exit remained connected to firm productivity over the course of the pandemic. Australia’s job retention scheme, JobKeeper, initially shielded productive and financially fragile firms, contributing positively to aggregate productivity. But as the economy recovered, the scheme grew more distortive, justifying its timely withdrawal – on productivity grounds at least.</span>

                    <span>From the NAR: Pending Home Sales Recover 8.1% in August
Pending home sales rebounded in August, recording significant gains after two prior months of declines, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Each of the four major U.S. regions mounted month-over-month growth in contract activity. However, those same territories reported decreases in transactions year-over-year, with the Northeast being hit hardest, enduring a double-digit drop.
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, increased 8.1% to 119.5 in August. Year-over-year, signings dipped 8.3%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI rose 4.6% to 96.2 in August, a 15.8% drop from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index climbed 10.4% to 115.4 last month, down 5.9% from August 2020.
Pending home sales transactions in the South increased 8.6% to an index of 141.8 in August, down 6.3% from August 2020. The index in the West grew 7.2% in August to 107.0, however still down 9.2% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was well above expectations of a 1.3% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in September and October.</span>

2019년 UN ‘기후행동정상회의’에서 65개국 정상들이 지구온난화를 막기 위하여 ‘2050년 탄소중립 달성’을 선언했다. 그리고 이 변화의 중심에는 에너지 전환이 있다. 에너지 전환은 우리의 삶이 변하는 시작점이 될 것이다. 일상생활은 물론 소비와 서비스, 비즈니스 등 전반적인 활동의 모든 흐름을 바꿀 것이며, 변화되어가는 사업 구조 속에서 일자리의 변화와 창출 또한 새롭게 이뤄질 것이다. 

코로나19로 4차 산업혁명으로 가는 시계가 더욱 빨라졌다. 그에 따라 기업들의 경영과 기술의 혁신도 빠르게 이루어지고 있다. 이제는 환경에 적응하는 것만으로는 살아남을 수 없는 시대가 됐다. 다가올 에너지 전환기에 맞춰 새롭게 변해가는 사업 구조와 일자리 시장에서 혁신해야 살아남을 수 있다. 새로운 역량과 시각으로 흔들리는 세계 시장의 판도에 대비하라. 기회는 준비된 자에게 온다.

                    <span>The World Bank permanently suspended its Doing Business project earlier this month. This column argues that the suspension puts an end to a very useful data-collection exercise that went astray by focusing on rankings and political publicity. Beyond specific conflicts of interest within the World Bank, the demise of Doing Business reaffirms Goodhart’s Law that when an index becomes a policy target, it ceases to be a good measure.</span>

                    <span>Swap and repo lines have become an integral part of the ECB’s toolkit. During the Global Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, the ECB announced more than 28 agreements to provide euro liquidity to foreign exchange markets, mainly within Europe. This column shows that the mere announcement instilled confidence in foreign exchange markets, reducing the premium paid by recipient country agents to borrow euros. Moreover, these lines not only prevent negative spillbacks to the euro area, but also push domestic bank equity prices in euro area countries highly exposed via banking linkages to targeted countries.</span>

                    <span>A few key points:
1) There is a clear seasonal pattern for house prices.
2) The surge in distressed sales during the housing bust distorted the seasonal pattern.
3) Even though distressed sales are down significantly, the seasonal factor is based on several years of data - and the factor is now closer to normal (second graph below).
4) Still the seasonal index is probably a better indicator of actual price movements than the Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) index.
For in depth description of these issues, see Jed Kolko&#x27;s article from 2014 (currently Chief Economist at Indeed) &quot;Let’s Improve, Not Ignore, Seasonal Adjustment of Housing Data&quot;
Note: I was one of several people to question the change in the seasonal factor (here is a post in 2009) - and this led to S&amp;P Case-Shiller questioning the seasonal factor too (from April 2010).  I still use the seasonal factor (I think it is better than using the NSA data).
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows the month-to-month change in the NSA Case-Shiller National index since 1987 (through July 2021). The seasonal pattern was smaller back in the &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s, and increased once the bubble burst. 
The seasonal swings declined following the bubble, however the recent price surge changed the month-over-month pattern.
The second graph shows the seasonal factors for the Case-Shiller National index since 1987.  The factors started to change near the peak of the bubble, and really increased during the bust.   
The swings in the seasonal factors have decreased, and the seasonal factors has been moving back towards more normal levels.

Note that the recent price surge hasn&#x27;t distorted the seasonal factors.</span>

                    <span>From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Highest Mortgage Rates in Nearly 3 Months
Mortgage rates continued somewhat higher on Monday as bond markets lost ground over the weekend, adding to the heavier losses seen on Thursday and Friday last week. ... This improves the outlook for the economy and further steels the resolve of the Federal Reserve to announce another instance of &quot;tapering&quot; (a reduction in the pace of the Fed&#x27;s rate-friendly bond buying efforts).  Unlike 2013, markets are much more prepared this time around, and in fact, we can credit tapering expectations for some of the weakness in rates seen earlier this year.
The average lender is at an eighth to a quarter of a percent higher in conventional 30yr fixed rates compared to the beginning of last week.  [30 year fixed 3.14%]

                    <span>We present a new database of banking-crisis interventions since the 13th century.  The database includes 1886 interventions in 20 categories across 138 countries, covering interventions during all of the crises identified in the main banking-crisis  chronologies, while also cataloguing a large number of interventions outside of  those crises. The data show a gradual shift over the past centuries from the  traditional interventions of a lender-of-last-resort, suspensions of convertibility, and bank holidays, towards a much more prominent role for capital injections and  sweeping guarantees of bank liabilities. Furthermore, intervention frequencies and  sizes suggest that the crisis problem in the financial sector has indeed reached an  apex during the post-Bretton Woods era – but that such trends are part of a more  deeply entrenched development that saw global intervention frequencies and sizes  gradually rise since at least the late 17th century.</span>

                    <span>In the United States, people with more education vote more. But, we know little about why education increases political participation or whether higher-quality education increases civic participation. We study applicants to Boston charter schools, using school lotteries to estimate charter attendance impacts for academic and voting outcomes. First, we confirm large academic gains for students in the sample of charter schools and cohorts investigated here. Second, we find that charter attendance boosts voter participation. Voting in the first presidential election after a student turns 18 increased substantially, by six percentage points from a base of 35 percent. The voting effect is driven entirely by girls and there is no increase in voter registration. Rich data and the differential effects by gender enable exploration of multiple potential channels for the voting impact. We find evidence consistent with two mechanisms: charter schools increase voting by increasing students’ noncognitive skills and by politicizing families who participate in charter school education.</span>

We develop a benchmark theoretical setting that integrates core corporate finance insights about the impact of financial frictions on investment with those from industrial organization on dynamic competition and industry evolution under perfect capital markets. Using state of the art computational tools to systematically detect and evaluate multiple equilibria and to thoroughly explore the parameter space of our model, we show how, depending on key industry characteristics such as market size, financial frictions impact firms&#x27; pricing and investment strategies and the degree of industry concentration.</span>

                    <span>In 1960, South Korea’s exports were about 1 percent of GDP, and the country’s ability to import depended almost entirely on US aid. After changing its foreign exchange and trade policies in the mid-1960s, Korea saw a surge in exports to more than 10 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. What factors account for the shift in policy that enabled this dramatic export growth to occur? The United States helped initiate the process by withholding financial assistance, pressuring Korea to devalue its currency and reform its foreign exchange regime. Initially, the Korean government resisted taking these steps, but in 1964 it became firmly committed to an export promotion strategy to boost foreign exchange earnings and end its dependence on American aid.</span>

                    <span>We develop a tractable general equilibrium model for understanding within- and between-occupation changes in skill use over time. We apply the model to skill-use measures from the third, fourth, and revised fourth editions of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and data from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses and March Current Population Surveys. We recover changes in skill productivity by exploiting between-occupation movements. Most importantly, finger-dexterity productivity grew rapidly while abstract-skill productivity lagged. We leverage these findings to estimate an inelastic relation between abstract and routine inputs and explain within-occupation shifts in skill use.</span>

                    <span>We experimentally study the impact of substantially larger enterprise loans, in collaboration with an Egyptian lender. Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals dramatic heterogeneity. Top-performers (i.e., those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, whereas profits for poor-performers drop. The magnitude of this difference implies that an individual lender’s credit allocation choices matter for aggregate income. Evidence on two fronts suggests large loans would be misallocated: top-performers are predicted by loan officers to have higher default rates; and, top-performers grow less than others when given small loans, implying that allocating larger loans based on prior performance is not efficient. Our results have important implications for credit expansion policy and our understanding of entrepreneurial talent: on the former, the use of psychometric data to identify top-performers suggests a pathway towards better allocation that revolves around entrepreneurial type more than firm type; on the latter, the reversal of fortune for poor-performers, who do well with small loans but not large, indicates a type of entrepreneur that we call a “go-getter” who performs well when constrained but poorly when not.</span>

                    <span>While foreigners are prominent in the Treasury market and in theoretical and empirical work, little is known about the nature of their Treasury portfolios. We provide novel evidence on foreigners&#x27; U.S. Treasury portfolios based on data not yet used by researchers: the security-level Treasury portfolios of foreigners and private U.S. investors. We find that private foreign investors earn above market returns and on a risk-adjusted basis both foreign private and foreign official investors outperform U.S. investors. Moreover, while foreign officials, with their broader objective functions, may well have inelastic demand, private foreign investors increase purchases of Treasuries and increase the duration of their Treasury portfolios when their sovereign yields are low or decrease relative to Treasury yields (that is, when CIP deviations decrease). Our results are so different from existing results that we close with a reconciliation exercise that provides a useful assessment of different sources of data on flows and holdings.</span>

                    <span>In 2018, the US launched a trade war with China, an abrupt departure from its historical leadership in integrating global markets. By late 2019, the US had tariffed roughly $350 billion of Chinese imports, and China had retaliated on $100 billion US exports. Economists have used a diversity of data and methods to assess the impacts of the trade war on the US, China and other countries.

                    <span>We argue that recoveries from demand-driven recessions with expenditure cuts concentrated in services or non-durables will tend to be weaker than recoveries from recessions more biased towards durables. Intuitively, the smaller the bias towards more durable goods, the less the recovery is buffeted by pent-up demand. We show that, in a standard multi-sector business-cycle model, this prediction holds if and only if, following an aggregate demand shock to all categories of spending (e.g., a monetary shock), expenditure on more durable goods reverts back faster. This testable condition receives ample support in U.S. data. We then use (i) a semi-structural shift-share and (ii) a structural model to quantify this effect of varying demand composition on recovery dynamics, and find it to be large. We also discuss implications for optimal stabilization policy.</span>

We characterize optimal assignment protocols and compare them to discretionary procedures, where it is the clients who select their service providers. Our results indicate that welfare gains from centralization are greater when tasks arrive more rapidly, and when training technologies improve. Monitoring seniors&#x27; backlog of clients always increases welfare but may decrease training.

                    <span>We examine the effects of bank merger and local market characteristics on local small business lending.  Mergers involving small, in-state acquirers are positively associated with small business loan (SBL) originations in counties where target banks are located.  Conversely, mergers involving large, out-of-state acquirers are associated with fewer SBL originations.  The analysis suggests that the results are driven by acquirer’s choice of target.  Small and in-state acquirers target banks that focus more on SBL and targets with strong relationships while large, out-of-state acquirers pursue better performing banks with stronger balance sheets and less focus on SBL.  Results are particularly strong in counties with a large number of small firms.  Post-merger activity supports banks expanding on their acquisition strategy decisions.  The findings suggest that acquirer strategy is important for evaluating the impact of acquisitions on local community development and that one-size-fits-all policy solutions for bank mergers may not produce common local outcomes.</span>

                    <span>While college enrollment has more-than doubled since 1970, elite colleges have barely increased supply, instead reducing admit rates. We show that straightforward reasons cannot explain this behavior. We propose a model where colleges compete on prestige, measured using relative selectivity or relative admit rates. A key comparative static of the model is that higher demand decreases [increases] the admit rate when the weight on prestige is above [below] a critical value, consistent with experience in elite [non-elite] colleges. A calibrated version of the model closely replicates the pattern in the data of declining admit rates at elite colleges while counter-factual simulations without prestige fail. Prestige competition is inefficient. Allowing elite colleges to collude on admissions strategy internalizes the non-pecuniary prestige externality and is Pareto improving.</span>

                    <span>We report the labor market effects of the Jamaica Early Childhood Stimulation intervention at age 31. The study is a small-sample randomized early childhood education stimulation intervention targeting stunted children living in the poor neighborhoods of Kingston, Jamaica. Implemented in 1987-1989, treatment consisted of a two-year home-based intervention designed to improve nutrition and the quality of mother-child interactions to foster cognitive, language and psycho-social skills. The original sample is 127 stunted children between 9 and 24 months old. Our study is able to track and interview 75% of the original sample 30 years after the intervention, both still living in Jamaica and migrated abroad. We find large and statistically significant effects on income and schooling; the treatment group had 43% higher hourly wages and 37% higher earnings than the control group. This is a substantial increase over the treatment effect estimated for age 22 where we observed a 25% increase in earnings. The Jamaican Study is a rare case of a long-term follow up for an early childhood development (ECD) intervention implemented in a less-developed country. Our results confirm large economic returns to an early childhood intervention that targeted disadvantaged families living in poverty in the poor neighborhoods of Jamaica. The Jamaican intervention is being replicated around the world. Our analysis provides justification for expanding ECD interventions targeting disadvantaged children living in poor countries around the world.</span>

                    <span>The transformation of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) into a more generous, inclusive monthly payment marks a historic (temporary) shift in U.S. treatment of low-income families. To investigate the initial impact of these payments, we apply a series of difference-in-difference estimates using Census Household Pulse Survey microdata collected from April 14 through August 16, 2021. Our findings offer three primary conclusions regarding the initial effects of the monthly CTC. First, payments strongly reduced food insufficiency: the initial payments led to a 7.5 percentage point (25 percent) decline in food insufficiency among low-income households with children. Second, the effects on food insufficiency are concentrated among families with 2019 pre-tax incomes below $35,000, and the CTC strongly reduces food insufficiency among low-income Black, Latino, and White families alike. Third, increasing the CTC coverage rate would be required in order for material hardship to be reduced further. Self-reports suggest the lowest-income households were less likely than higher-income families to receive the first CTC payments. As more children receive the benefit in future months, material hardship may decline further. Even with imperfect coverage, however, our findings suggest that the first CTC payments were largely effective at reducing food insufficiency among low-income families with children.</span>

                    <span>Many consumers below the top of the distribution of a representative population by cognitive abilities barely react to  monetary and fiscal policies that aim to stimulate consumption and borrowing, even when they are financially unconstrained and despite substantial debt capacity. Differences in income, formal education levels, economic expectations, and a large set of registry-based demographics do not explain these facts. Heterogeneous cognitive abilities thus act as human frictions in the transmission of economic policies that operate through the household sector and might imply  redistribution from low- to high-cognitive-ability agents. We conclude by discussing how our findings inform the microfoundation of behavioral macroeconomic theory.</span>

                    <span>This chapter (to appear in the forthcoming Handbook of International Economics, Vol. 5) develops a framework with which to interpret and survey answers to the question: how does increased openness affect aggregate welfare in a typical developing country? We decompose answers into four mechanisms: (i) an effect akin to technological progress that is purely mechanical; (ii) an effect on factoral terms of trade; (iii) a distortion revenue effect that exacerbates or mitigates the consequences of domestic distortions; and (iv) an effect of trade on the magnitude of those distortions themselves. Our focus lies in the last two mechanisms as these are especially important for the study of low-income settings where domestic distortions are thought to be rife. Throughout, we provide both a review of existing work on these topics and quantitative calculations that aim to gauge the magnitudes involved in a global model that is calibrated to match firm- and industry-level data on trade flows, production techniques, and a host of distortions (tariffs, other taxes, markups, bribes, theft, credit constraints, contracting failures, labor regulations, and public utility provision) that have featured in the literature.</span>

                    <span>Addressing public health externalities often requires community-level collective action. Each person’s sanitation behavior can affect the health of neighbors. We report on a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted with 19,000 households in rural Bangladesh where we randomized (1) either group financial incentives or a non-financial “social recognition” reward, and (2) asking each household to make either a private pledge or a public pledge to maintain hygienic latrines. The group financial reward has the strongest impact in the short term (3 months), inducing a 7.5-12.5 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership. Getting people to publicly commit to maintaining and using a hygienic latrine in front of their neighbors induced a 4.2-6.1 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership in the short term. In the medium term (15 months), the effect of the financial reward dissipates while the effect of the public commitment persists. Neither social recognition nor private commitments produce effects statistically distinguishable from zero.</span>

                    <span>We examine the start date of the Great Recession across OECD countries based on two successive quarters of negative GDP growth recession.  For most OECD countries this establishes the start of recession in Q22008 or Q32008.  We find that the Sahm Rule identifies the start of recession in the US to the beginning of 2008 but in other OECD countries it identifies the start in almost every case, after that identified by GDP.  But the GDP and labor market data are subject to major revisions, so the turn is not apparent in most countries for some time.  We establish our own rule for predicting recession using the fear of unemployment series to predict recession.  It involves looking for a ten-point rise in the series compared to its previous twelve month low.  These surveys are timely and have the major advantage they are not subject to revision. Across the OECD we confirm this finding with other types of qualitative data and especially so in the UK.  Qualitative surveys, we show, in the US in 2006 and 2007 predicted the subsequent recession and they did the same in Europe at the end of 2007 and in the early part of 2008.</span>

                    <span>This survey is organized around three main topics: models, econometrics, and empirical applications. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, introduces the concept of Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium, discusses existence and multiplicity, and describes the representation of this equilibrium in terms of conditional choice probabilities. We also discuss extensions of the basic framework, including models in continuous time, the concepts of oblivious equilibrium and experience-based equilibrium, and dynamic games where firms have non-equilibrium beliefs. In section 3, we first provide an overview of the types of data used in this literature, before turning to a discussion of identification issues and results, and estimation methods. We review different methods to deal with multiple equilibria and large state spaces. We also describe recent developments for estimating games in continuous time and incorporating serially correlated unobservables, and discuss the use of machine learning methods to solving and estimating dynamic games. Section 4 discusses empirical applications of dynamic games in IO. We start describing the first empirical applications in this literature during the early 2000s. Then, we review recent applications dealing with innovation, antitrust and mergers, dynamic pricing, regulation, product repositioning, advertising, uncertainty and investment, airline network competition, dynamic matching, and natural resources. We conclude with our view of the progress made in this literature and the remaining challenges.</span>

The Great Recession contributed to the decline in the early part of this period, but we are unable to identify any other economic, policy, or social factor that has changed since 2007 that is responsible for much of the decline beyond that. Mechanically, the falling birth rate can be attributed to changes in birth patterns across recent cohorts of women moving through childbearing age. We conjecture that the “shifting priorities” of more recent cohorts, reflecting changes in preferences for having children, aspirations for life, and parenting norms, may be responsible. We conclude with a brief discussion about the societal consequences for a declining birth rate and what the United States might do about it.</span>

                    <span>We design an experiment to understand how social preferences affect investment decisions through stock allocations and probability assessments. The major preference channel is asymmetric in social outcomes – although negative and positive responsible investment (RI) externalities have the same magnitudes, negative externalities have greater impact on investment choices. The effect is persistent, but heterogenous. We also find asymmetries in belief formation and learning constitute a secondary channel. Overall, our results are consistent with important stylized empirical facts and the predictions of recent RI theories that social preferences lead to different investment choices, but our analyses also suggest important future modeling directions.</span>

                    <span>Demand elasticities and other features of demand are critical determinants of the answers to most positive and normative questions about market power or the functioning of markets in practice. As a result, reliable demand estimation is an essential input to many types of research in Industrial Organization and other fields of economics. This chapter presents a discussion of some foundational issues in demand estimation. We focus on the distinctive challenges of demand estimation and  strategies one can use  to overcome them. We cover core models, alternative data settings, common estimation approaches, the role and choice of instruments, and nonparametric identification.</span>

                    <span>Violent conflicts, particularly at election times in Africa, are a common cause of instability and economic disruption. This paper studies how firms react to electoral violence using the case of Kenyan flower exporters during the 2008 post-election violence as an example. The violence induced a large negative supply shock that reduced exports primarily through workers&#x27; absence and had heterogeneous effects: larger firms and those with direct contractual relationships in export markets suffered smaller production and losses of workers. On the demand side, global buyers were not able to shift sourcing to Kenyan exporters located in areas not directly affected by the violence nor to neighboring Ethiopian suppliers. Consistent with difficulties in insuring against supply-chain risk disruptions caused by electoral violence, firms in direct contractual relationships ramp up shipments just before the subsequent 2013 presidential election to mitigate risk.</span>

                    <span>We fully solve an assignment problem with heterogeneous firms and multiple heterogeneous workers whose skills are imperfect substitutes, that is, when production is submodular. We show that sorting is neither positive nor negative and is characterized sufficiently by two regions. In the first region, mediocre firms sort with mediocre workers and coworkers such that output losses are equal across all these pairings (complete mixing). In the second region, high skill workers sort with a low skill coworker and a high productivity firm, while high productivity firms employ a low skill worker and a high skill coworker (pairwise countermonotonicity). The equilibrium assignment is also necessarily characterized by product countermonotonicity, meaning that sorting is negative for each dimension of heterogeneity with the product of heterogeneity in the other dimensions. The equilibrium assignment as well as wages and firm values are completely characterized in closed form. We illustrate our theory with an application to show that our model is consistent with the observed dispersion of earnings within and across U.S. firms. Our counterfactual analysis gives evidence that the change in the firm project distribution between 1981 and 2013 has a larger effect on the observed change in earnings dispersion than the change in the worker skill distribution.</span>

                    <span>We examine the effects of active international reserve management (IRM) conducted by central banks of emerging market economies (EMEs) on firm investment in the presence of global financial shocks. Using firm level data from 46 EMEs from 2000 to 2018, we document four findings. First, active IRM positively affects firm investment - the effect strengthens with the magnitude of adverse external financial shocks. Second, financially constrained firms, compared with unconstrained ones, are less responsive to active IRM. Third, our results suggest that the country credit spread is a plausible causal channel of the positive IRM effect on firm investment. Fourth, the policies of capital controls and exchange rate managements are complementary to the IRM – it is beneficial to form a macro policy mix including active IRM to safeguard firm investment against global financial shocks. Further, our results indicate the IRM effect on firm investment is both statistical and economical significance and is relevant to the aggregate economy.</span>

                    <span>Does partisan perception shape the flow of international capital? We provide evidence from two settings, syndicated corporate loans and equity mutual funds, to show that ideological alignment with foreign governments affects the cross-border capital allocation by U.S. institutional investors. Moreover, we find that ideological alignment with foreign countries also affects investments of non-U.S. investors and can explain patterns in bilateral FDI flows. Our empirical strategy ensures that direct economic effects of foreign elections or bilateral ties between countries are not driving the result. Combined, our findings imply that partisan perception is a global phenomenon and its economic effects transcend national borders.</span>

Harmonizing all surveys that ask about father&#x27;s occupation and own family income, we develop a mobility measure that allows for the inclusion of non-whites and women for the 1910s–1970s birth cohorts.  We show a robust increase in mobility between the 1910s and 1940s cohorts, about half of which is driven by absolute convergence in racial income gaps. We also find that excluding Black Americans, particularly Black women, considerably overstates mobility throughout the 20th century.</span>

                    <span>Conventional wisdom often holds that the healthcare sector fares better than other sectors during economic downturns. However, little research has examined the relationship between local economic conditions and healthcare employment. Understanding how the healthcare sector responds to economic conditions is important for policy makers seeking to ensure an adequate supply of healthcare workers, as well as for those directing displaced workers into new jobs. We examine the impact of macroeconomic conditions on both the healthcare labor market and the pipeline of healthcare workers receiving healthcare degrees during a pre-COVID time period, 2005-2017. Our results indicate that the healthcare sector is stable across past business cycles. If anything, when areas experience more severe local economic downturns, healthcare employment increases. Much remains unknown about the adjustments and lasting impacts for the healthcare sector associated with the COVID era. Our study represents an important backdrop as policy makers consider ways to sustain the healthcare sector during economic and public health turbulence.</span>

                    <span>The adoption of healthcare technology is central to improving productivity in this sector. To provide new evidence on how technology affects healthcare markets, we focus on one area where adoption has been particularly rapid: surgery for prostate cancer. Over just six years, robotic surgery grew to become the dominant intensive prostate cancer treatment method. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that adopting a robot drives prostate cancer patients to the hospital. To test whether this result reflects market expansion or business stealing, we also consider market-level effects of adoption and find they are significant but smaller, suggesting that adoption expands the market while also reallocating some patients across hospitals. Marginal patients are relatively young and healthy, inconsistent with the concern that adoption broadens the criteria for intervention to patients who would gain little from it. We conclude by discussing implications for the social value of technology diffusion in healthcare markets.</span>

We found that the proportion of maternal hospitalizations with marijuana use disorder increased by 23% (0.3 percentage points) in the first three years after RML implementation, with larger effects in states authorizing commercial sales of marijuana. This growth was accompanied by a 7% (0.4 percentage points) decline in tobacco use disorder hospitalizations, yielding a net zero effect over all substance use disorder hospitalizations. RMLs were not associated with changes in newborn health. MMLs had no significant effect on maternal substance use disorder hospitalizations nor on newborn health and fairly small effects could be ruled out.

We use CPS data from January 2016 to June 2021, limiting the sample to childless individuals who lack a college degree. In the younger group (aged 15-19), we observe the expected sharp reduction in outcomes at the start of the pandemic, followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels of work hours, employment, and labor force participation starting in September 2020, with outcomes even surpassing pre-pandemic levels in April and May 2021. In the older age group (20-24-year-olds), however, work hours, employment, and labor force participation were still lagging below pre-pandemic levels as of June 2021. As of June 2021, weekly earnings and hourly wages were higher than typical pre-pandemic levels for that month for both age groups. Although we cannot test directly whether enhanced UI programs have played a role in these differences by age group, our findings show that within the 15-24-year-old age group, there is significant heterogeneity in labor market recovery from the COVID-19 recession.</span>

                    <span>We study the effects of fiscal policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the firm, sector, country and global level. First, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and policy responses on small and medium sized enterprise (SME) business failures. We combine firm-level financial data from 50 sectors in 27 countries, a detailed I-O network, real-time data on lockdown policies and mobility patterns, and a rich model of firm behavior that allows for several dimensions of heterogeneity. We find: (a) Absent government support, the failure rate of SMEs would have increased by 9 percentage points, significantly more so in emerging market economies (EMs). With policy support it only increased by 4.3 percentage points, and even decreased in advanced economies (AEs). (b) Fiscal policy was poorly targeted: most of the funds disbursed went to firms who did not need it. (c) Nevertheless, we find little evidence of the policy merely postponing mass business failures or creating many ‘zombie’ firms: failure rates rise only slightly in 2021 once policy support is removed. Next, we build a tractable global intertemporal general equilibrium I-O model with fiscal policy. We calibrate the model to 64 countries and 36 sectors. We find that: (d) a sizable share of the global economy is demand-constrained under COVID-19, especially so in EMs. (e) Globally, fiscal policy helped offset about 8% of the downturn in COVID, with a low ‘traditional’ fiscal multiplier. Yet it significantly reduced the share of demand- constrained sectors, preserving employment in these sectors. (f) Fiscal policy exerted small and negative spillovers to output in other countries but positive spillovers on employment. (g) A two-speed recovery would put significant upwards pressure on global interest rates which imposes an additional headwind on the EM recovery. (h) Corporate and sovereign spreads rise when global rates increase, suggesting that EM may face challenging external funding conditions as AEs economies normalize.</span>

                    <span>Privatization of a public good (the management of sewage treatment centers in Dakar, Senegal) leads to an increase in the productivity of downstream sewage dumping companies and a decrease in downstream prices of the services they provide to households. We use the universe of legal dumps of sanitation waste from May 2009 to November 2018 to show that legal dumping increased substantially following privatization–on average an increase of 61.7%, or an increase of about 14,000 cubic meters each month. This is due to increased productivity of all trucks, not just those associated with the company managing the treatment centers. Household-level survey data shows that prices of legal sanitary dumping decreased by ten percent following privatization, and DHS data show that diarrhea rates among children under five decreased in Dakar relative to secondary cities in Senegal following privatization with no similar effect on respiratory illness as a placebo.</span>

                    <span>In the last decade, Gulf countries have imposed hiring quotas to promote the participation of natives in the private sector and address high levels of unemployment, particularly among women and the youth. This paper explores how one such policy, Nitaqat in Saudi Arabia, affected the outcomes of exporting firms, the most productive sector of the non-oil economy.  We find that whereas the policy was successful in increasing the employment of Saudi nationals by these firms, it came at a high cost. In the year following the announcement of the policy, relative to firms above the quota, firms below the quota were 1.5 percentage points more likely to exit the market, 7 percentage points less likely to export, and conditional on exporting, the value of their exports fell by 14 percent. Additionally, surviving treated firms reduced their labor force by 10 percent. We find that to comply with the policy, firms hired mostly lower-wage, low-skilled Saudis. The policy doubled the share of women in treated firms. Importantly, we find that these short-term effects persisted for at least three years after the policy’s implementation.</span>

                    <span>Taiwan was perhaps the first developing country to adopt an export-oriented trade strategy after World War II. The factors usually associated with big shifts in policy—a macroeconomic crisis, a change in political power or institutions, lobbying by export interests, pressure from international financial institutions—were not present; it was ideas that were key. In 1954, economist S. C. Tsiang proposed that Taiwan boost export earnings rather than squeeze import spending to deal with its chronic shortage of foreign exchange. He recommended a currency devaluation to establish a realistic exchange rate and a market-based system of foreign exchange allocation to end the inefficient rationing by the government.

                    <span>Corporate debt has increased substantially in many parts of the world during the pandemic, raising concerns about the effects on investment in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock. This column uses data for a large panel of US firms to investigate the implications of firm-specific debt booms for investment. It finds that debt booms lead financially constrained firms to decrease capital expenditures and intangibles, underscoring the importance of dealing with debt overhang for managing the US recovery.</span>

                    <span>During the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Japan, the Japanese government decided to provide a Special Cash Payment of 100,000 yen per person to all residents as a part of its “Emergency Economic Measures to Cope with COVID-19”. This column uses publicly available survey data to estimate the marginal propensity to consume from the cash transfer in order to assess the impact of the policy. It finds that the payments increased non-negligible consumption mainly due to their size, but the marginal propensity to consume, at around 10 %, is no different from non-pandemic periods.</span>

                    <span>Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in August was 1.62%, down from 1.74% in July.  Freddie&#x27;s rate is down year-over-year from 3.17% in August 2020.
Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.12%, down from 0.15% in July, and down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.</span>

                    <span>Note: This is as of September 19th.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Decreases to 2.96%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance  decreased by 4 basis points from 3.00% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 2.96% as of  September 19, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.5 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
  
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 1.44%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance increased 3 basis points to 3.42%, and the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) decreased 4 basis points to 6.91%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers decreased 1 basis point relative to  the prior week to 3.24%, and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased  4 basis points to 3.06%.
  
“The share of loans in forbearance continued to decrease last week, dropping below 3 percent for the  first time since March 2020,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist.  “However, there was a slight increase in the forbearance share for Ginnie Mae loans, and this increase  was seen for both depository and IMB servicers. New forbearance requests and re-entries continue to  run at a higher rate for Ginnie Mae loans as well as for portfolio and PLS loans, which include many  delinquent FHA, VA, and USDA loans that have been bought out of Ginnie Mae pools.”

Excerpt: 
With the ten year yield close to 1.50%, and based on an historical relationship, 30-year rates should currently be around 3.4%.
Mortgage News Daily reports that the most prevalent 30 year fixed rate is now at 3.13% for top tier scenarios. So mortgage rates are a little lower than expected.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of September 24th, inventory was at 433 thousand (7 day average), compared to 568 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.8%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55% from 963 thousand.


A week ago, inventory was at 436 thousand, and was down 23.8% YoY.   Three weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far).


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February).  Now inventory may be peaking for the year.   Inventory was about 41.1% above the record low in early April.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for September.</span>

재테크를 잘해서 조기 은퇴를 꿈꾸는 MZ세대들이 점점 늘어나고 있다. 낮은 금리로 인해 은행저축보다 좀더 빠른 방법으로 돈을 모으고자 주식, 펀드, 가상화폐, 부동산 등에 투자하지만 실상 원하는 만큼 수익을 내기란 쉽지 않다. 

하지만 투자를 통해 고수익을 낸 젊은 투자가들이 심심치 않게 화제가 되고 있고, 그들을 보면서 나 역시 그렇게 되고 싶은 욕망이 점점 더 커진다. 하지만 정작 ‘경제 원리’에 대해서 제대로 알고 투자를 시작하는 사람들이 얼마나 될까.

이 책은 MZ세대들을 위한 일종의 ‘돈의 교과서’다. 우리나라에서 배울 수 없는 체계적인 돈 공부를 위한 책으로, 실제로 미국 학교에서 배우는 경제 교과서다. 이 책은 미국 경제의 모든 것을 담고 있는데, 왜 우리가 미국 경제를 알아야 하는지 의아해 할 수도 있다. 하지만 세계 경제의 기준이 되는 미국 경제. 미국 경제를 아는 만큼 돈의 흐름도 보이기 때문이다. 

돈의 흐름을 보면 내가 어디에 투자해야 하고, 어떻게 돈을 관리해야 하는지 보인다. 오랜 세월 수많은 시행착오를 통해 지금의 경제대국이 된 미국 경제의 흐름을 상세히 들여다보면서, 단순히 투자를 통해 단시간에 돈을 버는 법이 아니라 돈의 흐름과 기본 경제 개념을 알려줘 체계적으로 학습하도록 돕는 책이다.

2021년 8월 6일, 인터넷 전문은행 카카오뱅크는 상장 첫날 시가총액 33조 원을 기록하며 성공적인 기업공개(IPO)를 마무리했다. 문을 연 지 1,472일 된 인터넷 전문은행이 세기를 넘나든 역사를 가진 전통 시중은행의 기업가치를 훌쩍 뛰어넘게 된 것이다. 오프라인 점포 한 곳 없는 ‘모바일 온리 뱅크’는 전국 수십, 수백 개의 지점을 거느린 기존 거대 은행들을 가볍게 제치고 명실상부 국내 최고로 자리매김하였다.

카카오뱅크가 일으킨 쇼크는 신호탄에 불과하다. 금융산업에서 인터넷 전문은행이 촉발하는 혁신의 바람은 당분간은 지속될 것으로 전망된다. 1호로 설립 인가를 받은 케이뱅크는 올해 2분기(4~6월)에 사상 첫 흑자를 달성했고 2023년까지 상장을 목표로 하고 있다. 시장에서는 케이뱅크의 기업가치를 10조 원 안팎으로 판단하고 있다. 또한 인터넷 전문은행 3호 토스뱅크가 공격적 마케팅과 함께 10월 출범을 앞두고 있다.

금융업계는 미래 주도권을 두고 치열한 경쟁을 벌이는 중이다. 1990년대에는 인터넷뱅킹이라는 단어조차 낯설게 느껴졌지만 이제는 상황이 다르다. 기성세대로 분류되는 50~60대조차 스마트폰으로 자동이체하고 금융 내역을 조회하는 세상이 되었다. 지난 수십 년간 인터넷 전문은행은 진화에 진화를 거듭하며 ‘메기가 아닌 상어’로 성장했다. 그리고 2021년, 한국의 금융업은 대한민국의 경계를 넘어 글로벌 핀테크 기업과 맞설 경쟁력을 길러야 할 때를 맞이했다.

《인터넷 전문은행》은 금융계에 불어온 디지털 혁신은 물론 전 세계 금융 선진국의 핀테크 현주소를 살폈다. 현금 없는 사회로 이동하고 있는 EU, 금융사가 아니라 IT 기업임을 자처하는 독일의 피도르뱅크, 한국보다 발 빠르게 움직이고 있는 중국의 간편결제 서비스 이야기는 한국 금융기업에 경각심을 일깨운다. 여기에 인터넷 전문은행의 적으로 불리는 금산분리 문제, 데이터 공유를 둘러싼 이슈 등을 통해 규제 완화와 보강에 대한 논의를 더했다.

한비자의 결정적 순간의 선택과 결단의 경영 노하우를 각자의 위치에서 자기 역량을 최대한 발휘할 수 있도록 그 비법을 정리한 내용으로 경영자와 모든 직장인들을 위한 책이다. 경영자와 각 기업의 직장인들이 인간경영의 전문가가 되어, 서로를 설득하는 커뮤니케이션으로 윈윈 하는 전략을 현실과 상황에 맞추어 구체적으로 설명하고 해결방법을 제시하고 정리했다.

그리고 관련 주제를 총 19장으로 나누어 권력의 핵심을 잡기 위해 필요한 법(法)·술(術)·세(勢)의 세부 사항을 자세히 풀어놓았다. 또한 각각의 주제에 맞는 의 원문을 해석한 뒤 지금 우리가 살고 있는 현대사회에 맞는 예시와 설명을 소제목 아래 한눈에 알아볼 수 있도록 배치하여 이질감 없이 받아들일 수 있도록 하였다.

초개방화 시대를 사는 우리에게 환율, 그중에서도 달러-원 환율은 생활과 매우 밀접하게 맞닿아 있다. 그러나 주식투자자라면 환율에 특히 더 민감해야만 한다. 미국주식 등 해외주식에 투자하고 있는 서학개미는 물론이고, 국내주식 투자자라도 제대로 투자하기 위해서는 몇 개의 주요 환율을 꾸준히 모니터링 해야 한다. 환율은 투자수익에 직간접적으로 영향을 미치는 요인이 되므로 환율을 아는 투자자와 모르는 투자자는 수익률이 다를 수밖에 없다. 이에 투자자의 관점에서 중요한 환율 포인트들을 쉽게 풀어쓴 책이 나왔다. 

이 책은 환율책이지만 투자전략서이자 전망서이다. 달러가 약세일 때와 강세일 때, 해외주식과 국내주식에 투자하는 투자자들은 각각 어떻게 대처해야 할지 환율과 투자의 메커니즘을 낱낱이 분석한다. 환율과 주가, 환율과 국가경제, 환율과 기업경제가 어떻게 움직이는지를 친절하게 알려준다. 

이 책을 읽다 보면 세계경제의 입체적인 움직임이 보이고 자신만의 전략적인 투자 포트폴리오를 완성할 수 있을 것이다. 환율을 하나의 투자지표로서만 보는 것이 아니다. 매우 매력적인 투자수단으로서의 외환투자의 노하우도 알려준다. 미국, 중국, 일본 등 주요 경제국들의 경제 이슈와 함께 각 나라의 통화 투자에 대한 전망도 담았다. 

현재 시점에서 예측 가능한 앞으로의 환율 움직임을 짚어보고 그에 따른…</span>

경제, 경영 및 금융 관련 분야 종사자 및 관련 학과 학생들이 2023년부터 시행될 바젤3 시장리스크 신표준방법 산출 체계를 직관적으로 이해할 수 있게 하고, 일련의 산출 체계를 시스템화하는 과정에서 제기되는 이슈들에 대한 해결 방안을 소개한다.

바젤2.5 표준방법 산출 체계는 은행권만이 아니라 금융투자업에서 시장위험액을 산출하는 데 차용되고 있어 향후 바젤3 신표준방법이 시행될 경우 금융투자업 시장위험액 산출 체계 역시 변화를 피할 수 없을 것으로 보인다. 

현재 많은 문헌들은 이러한 신표준방법 산출 방법 및 시스템 개발을 위한 방향 제시를 하는 것이 대부분이어서 실제 신표준방법이 적용될 경우 트레이딩 포지션에 어떤 영향을 가져오는지 구체적으로 기술된 내용을 찾기 쉽지 않다. 이에 본 책에서는 구체적인 사례를 들어 시장리스크 규제자본에 대한 영향도 분석 결과를 보여주고자 한다.

금융이 생산 부문에 자본을 공급하는 본연의 역할에서 벗어나 거대한 부의 약탈 기계로 변모하는 &#x27;금융화&#x27;의 전모를 생생히 추적한 책이다. 저자는 금융 부문이 적정한 규모를 넘어서 지나치게 비대해진 역사적 과정을 낱낱이 파헤치고, 이 비정상적인 금융화가 경제와 사회 전반 그리고 개인의 삶에 끼치는 피해 양상을 적나라하게 고발한다. 아울러 파생상품, 신탁, 특수목적회사, 사모투자 등 첨단 금융 기법들의 작동 원리를 속속들이 해부하면서 2007년 세계 금융위기의 원인을 진단하고, 여전히 불씨를 안고 있는 금융위기를 경고한다.

또한 독점금융에 포획된 정부가 이들의 탐욕으로부터 사회를 보호하기는커녕 막대한 수익만 뽑아먹고 그 위험은 외부로 떠넘기는 금융이라는 이름의 사기도박을 방조하면서, 그것이 &#x27;국가경쟁력&#x27;을 높이는 길이라고 강변하는 좌우를 막론한 정치적 선전의 허구성을 비판한다. 나아가 회계사, 법률가, 경제학자 등 전문가집단이 왜, 어떻게 부의 약탈자들과 결탁하고 약탈 행위를 옹호하는지 밝혀낸다. 저자는 약탈자들의 탐욕에 맞서 경제와 민주주의를 지키기 위한 싸움에 시민들이 적극적으로 나서야 한다고 주장하면서, &#x27;똑똑한 자본 통제&#x27;를 대안으로 제시한다.

3장 악의 소굴이 된 제국의 심장
대영제국의 영광을 이끈 주역 | 제국의 몰락과 새로운 부의 원천의 출현 | 금융해적 소굴의 심장부가 되다 | 생선은 머리부터 썩고, 권력은 돈에서 나온다

4장 우리에게 독식을 허하라
시장경쟁을 막아서 경쟁력을 높인다? | 옛날 옛적에 반독점이 살았는데 | 뻔히 보이지만 존재할 수 없다는 괴상한 논리 | 독점은 어떻게 경제를 좀먹는가 | 그들이 세상을 지배할 때

5장 제3의 길은 없다
룩셈부르크에서는 금융에 태클 걸지 마라 | 돈은 정치의 일부다 | 제3의 길에 맛을 들인 진보 좌파 | 국가경쟁력이라는 헛소리 | 영국은 왜 룩셈부르크가 될 수 없나 | 금융위기 이후에도 아무것도 바뀌지 않았다

6장 켈트 호랑이의 폭풍성장과 추락

서학개미를 위한 미국 주식 퀀트투자 입문+실습서이다. 퀀트투자는 수학적, 통계적 기법을 활용해 투자 종목을 발굴하는 투자 방법이다. 퀀트투자 전략을 만들기 위해서는 유명한 전략들이 어떻게 만들어졌는지 개념을 이해하고, 어떻게 구현됐는지 기본기를 따라 하며 배워야 한다. 다만 투자 대가들의 전략을 소개한 책은 쉽게 찾아볼 수 있지만, 그 전략을 구현한 기술적인 방법을 담은 책은 매우 찾아보기 어렵다. 또한 퀀트투자 전략을 공부하기 위해서는 코딩이나 수학 등 부가적인 배경지식이 필요하다. 

이 책은 이미 잘 알려진 투자 대가들의 전략을 소개하고 자신의 컴퓨터에서 이 전략을 구현해보며 응용하는 방법을 알려준다. 책을 따라 미국 주식 퀀트투자 과정을 배우고 나면 자신만의 투자 전략을 스스로 개발할 수 있을 것이다.

                    <span>Immigration has been a central political debate in the United States for decades, in part because of public concerns about its magnitude and its composition. For example, in the early 2000s, around 1.25 million immigrants arrived each year (Card, 2009). The share of immigrants in the US working-age population increased from 10% in 1990 to […]

                    <span>Despite early predictions of a large collapse, remittance flows to developing countries have been surprisingly resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This column describes how migrants appear to have responded positively to rising COVID-19 infection rates in their home countries despite economic challenges in host countries. Fiscal stimulus in host countries played a role in keeping remittances buoyant. Travel restrictions, on the other hand, seem to have positively affected official remittance flows, suggesting such restrictions led migrants to use formal channels to send remittances instead of informal channels.</span>

From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 are up 7 and DOW futures are up 92 (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $74.53	per barrel and Brent at $78.55 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $40, and Brent was at $41 - so WTI oil prices are UP 90% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic). 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.18 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.18 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.00 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

The bottom line is the recent increase in MEW is not concerning - it is far less as a percent of disposable personal income than during the bubble, and most homeowners have substantial equity.</span>

                    <span>The transition to a carbon-neutral economy requires firms and banks to have environmental consciousness, raising the question of how bank financing can contribute to global climate objectives. This column examines whether and how the environmental consciousness (or ‘greenness’) of firms and banks is reflected in the pricing of bank credit. The evidence suggests that firms are indeed rewarded for being green: green firms can get cheaper loans – although only when borrowing from green banks and only since the 2015 ratification of the Paris Agreement.</span>

                    <span>Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of September 21st.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Little Movement in Forbearance Volumes This Week
The number of active forbearance plans fell by 18,000 (-1.4%) this week, leaving 1.58 million U.S. homeowners in COVID-19 forbearance as of September [21].
Declines of 11,000 and 10,000 among FHA/VA and GSE loans respectively were partially offset by a 3,000 rise in PLS/portfolio plans. Overall, forbearances are now down 182,000 (-10%) from the same time last month, with the strongest decline (-13%) seen among GSE plans.
The population of mortgage holders in COVID-19 related forbearance plans represents 3% of all active mortgages, including 1.7% of GSE, 5.2% of FHA/VA and 3.8% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
In terms of forbearance plan starts, 15,000 new plans were initiated since last Tuesday – down slightly from last week’s 16,000 starts – while 34,000 plans were restarted, compared to last week’s volume of 35,000. Meanwhile, in typical mid-month behavior, plan exits dipped slightly this week, but are expected to ramp up in coming weeks.

  More than 460,000 plans are still slated for review for extension/removal over the final week of September, with some 300,000 set to reach their final expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths. This could lead to significant movement in volumes entering early October.

                    <span>The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 740 thousand.
The previous three months were revised up, combined. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in August 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 740,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 1.5 percent above the revised July rate of 729,000, but is 24.3 percent below the August 2020 estimate of 977,000.

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.
New home sales are now declining year-over-year since sales soared following the first few months of the pandemic.
The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply.
The months of supply increased in August to 6.1 months from 6.0 months in July. 
The all time record high was 12.1 months of supply in January 2009.  The all time record low was 3.5 months, most recently in October 2020.
This is above the normal range (about 4 to 6 months supply is normal).
&quot;The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of August was 378,000.  This represents a supply of 6.1 months at the current sales rate.&quot;
The last graph shows sales NSA (monthly sales, not seasonally adjusted annual rate).
In August 2021 (red column), 62 thousand new homes were sold (NSA).  Last year, 81 thousand homes were sold in August.
The all time high for August was 110 thousand in 2005, and the all time low for August was 23 thousand in 2010.
This was above expectations of 714 thousand SAAR and sales in the three previous months were revised up, combined.  I&#x27;ll have more later today.</span>

문재인 정부의 경제정책 5년을 돌아보고 새로운 시대의 개혁을 부르짖는 책이 출간되었다. 이 책은 변화하는 한국사회에 발맞추어 ‘경제정책의 개혁’이 선행되어야 한다고 주장한다. 과거의 관념과 유산을 털어버리고, 새로운 시대에 맞도록 경제정책의 관점과 인식을 대전환해야 한다고 힘주어 말한다. 

책은 성장담론을 시작으로 부동산, 교육, 재정, 복지, 의료, 저출생, 외교, 환경에 이르기까지 한국사회 곳곳에 현미경을 들이댄다. 정교한 분석과 날카로운 문제의식을 무기로 각각의 정책이 어떻게 추진되었으며, 무엇이 문제였는지 샅샅이 살핀다. 나아가 대안을 제시하는 시도 또한 잊지 않는다. 성장에서 성숙으로 넘어가야 하는 지금, 우리 앞에 찾아온 《정책의 시간》이다.

이제는 &quot;인공지능이 어떤 일을 할 수 있을까?&quot;라는 질문에서 &quot;인공지능이 도대체 할 수 없는 일은 무엇인가?&quot;라는 자조 섞인 질문으로 바뀌었다. 대부분의 전문가는 앞으로 5년 이내에 모든 기술 데이터와 인프라가 AI 기반으로 바뀔 것이라고 말한다. 2010년 전후 모바일에 적응한 기업과 그렇지 못한 기업을 구분했던 것처럼, 모든 제품과 서비스는 AI 기술을 제대로 활용하느냐, 못하느냐로 구분되는 시기가 도래했다.

AI 기술과 비즈니스에 대한 이해 없이는 미래를 준비할 수 없는 이유다. 이 책은 AI의 역사에서 시작하여 핵심 기술과 비즈니스, AI의 창의성과 공정성, 그리고 인간과의 상호작용까지를 폭넓게 다루고 있다. 또한 단순한 트렌드 분석을 넘어 신기술 분야 투자에 대한 통찰과 기술 스타트업의 관점까지를 모두 다루고 있어 AI에 관심이 있는 초보자에서부터 AI 관련 조직에서 일하는 구성원 모두에게 유용하다. 또한 글로벌 AI 전문가들과의 생생한 인터뷰는 이 책의 가치를 더한다.

                    <span>Quantitative easing is often criticised due to side effects on asset price valuation and risk taking. This column compares the financial side effects of conventional monetary policy to those of quantitative easing, based on the amount of inflation generated by each policy. A systematic comparison of multiple measures of financial side effects for the euro area, the UK, and the US suggests that the side effects of quantitative easing and conventional monetary policy are roughly the same.</span>

                    <span>Do countries benefit from servicing their debts during times of sovereign defaults? Colombia is typically regarded as the only large Latin American country that did not default in the 1980s, but this column argues that the case of Colombia is more complex than commonly assumed. Although it had to re-profile its debts, high-level political support from the US allowed Colombia to do so outside of the standard framework of an IMF programme. In the short to medium run, Colombia benefited from avoiding an explicit default, but this strategy did not lead to long-term reputational gains.</span>

Excerpt: 
For the last year, most housing markets moved together with rapidly falling inventory and sharply increasing house prices. However, in August, about half of these markets saw a month-over-month (MoM) increase in inventory - and the other half saw a decrease - so we might be seeing some regional divergence.</span>

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotels Achieve Four-Week Occupancy High
U.S. hotel occupancy reached a four-week high, according to STR‘s latest data through September 18.
September 12-18, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 63.0% (-11.6%)
• verage daily rate (ADR): $131.04 (-2.6%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $82.50 (-13.9%)
The gain in occupancy was helped by weekly group demand eclipsing 1 million for the first time since the earliest days of the pandemic. More group demand created a lowering effect on ADR, as group rooms for upper-tier classes are typically priced lower than transient rooms.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.</span>

                    <span>To win the critical race between vaccines and mutations, the worldwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign must mobilise economies of scale. The most effective way to do so, this column argues, is to convert the existing Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative into a more generously endowed global fund. Instead of merely obtaining the surplus vaccines of rich countries, and relying on unpredictable donations, the initiative should acquire the most promising vaccine patents and offer free production licenses to every qualified vaccine and generic drug manufacturer in the global South.</span>

Along with millions of non-political prisoners, they were forcedly resettled to the Gulag, the system of labour camps across the Soviet Union. This column looks at the long-run consequences of this dark resettlement episode. It shows that areas around camps with a larger share of enemies of the people among camp prisoners are more prosperous today, as captured by firms’ wages and profits, as well as night lights per capita.</span>

메타버스에서 요즘 화두는 디지털 가상 경제에 관한 것이다. 메타버스 이커머스로 가장 공격적인 기업으로 페이스북을 비롯해 국내 기업으로는 ‘제페토’의 네이버와 ‘이프랜드’의 SKT가 꼽힌다. SK mySUNI 부사장인 저자는 메타버스 최일선에서 터득한 메타버스의 진면목, 특히 NFT, 디파이(Defi)같은 메타버스 가상 경제의 큰 틀을 이루는 블록체인 기술에 대해서 알기 쉽게 설명할 뿐 아니라 메타버스가 가져올 시대 변화, 이에 따른 준비 등을 점검하도록 한다. 

이 책 타이틀의 ‘3번째 세상’이란 2000년 웹, 2010년 모바일, 2020년 메타버스로 이어지는 10년 주기의 디지털 산업의 큰 플랫폼의 흐름을 의미한다. 저자는 2000년대의 웹이 콘텐츠, 미디어, 커머스 산업에 위기를 가져왔고, 2010년대의 모바일이 통신, 교통, 배달 산업에 영향을 준 것처럼 2020년대의 메타버스는 또 어떤 변화를 가져올지, 그것을 위기로 만드느냐 기회로 삼느냐는 전적으로 우리의 준비에 달려 있다고 강조한다. 

또 저자는 “메타버스를 차원이 다른 세상이라고 보는 이유는 첫째, 기존 PC나 스마트폰이 보여주지 못한 입체감과 전혀 다른 경험을 제공한다는 것과 둘째, 오프라인 현실과 통합된 디지털의 경험을 제시하고 있다는 것”이라고 말한다. 또 ‘제3세상’이라는 표현도 사용하는데 “제1의 세상은…</span>

채 2년도 되지 않은 기간에 우리는 이전에는 상상할 수 없었던 변화를 목격하고 있다. 어느 날 갑자기 등장한 코로나 바이러스는 개인과 기업, 시장과 사회 등 모든 분야의 추세(trend line)를 10년씩 앞당기고 있으며, 무엇보다 이러한 변화의 속도는 앞으로 점점 더 빨라질 것으로 보인다. 피할 수도, 벗어날 수도 없는 ‘거대한 가속’이 강타한 세상은 팬데믹 이후 어떤 식으로 펼쳐질 것인가? 

세계 최고의 비즈니스 스쿨 교수로 꼽히는 스콧 갤러웨이 뉴욕대 교수는 ‘비즈니스 판도, 교육 시장, 정부의 역할’이라는 3가지 키워드로 미래를 지배할 새로운 패러다임을 설득력 있게 분석한다. 팬데믹으로 양극화된 자본시장에서 더욱 강력해진 플랫폼 제국 ‘빅 4’의 다음 행보는 무엇일까? 이들에 맞서 도전하는 시장 교란자들은 누구인가? 거리 두기로 촉발된 대규모 원격 교육은 교육 시장에 어떠한 위험과 기회를 가져다줄까? 나날이 쌓여가는 자본과 혁신 속에 사회가 새롭게 주목하는 가치는 무엇이 될까? 

대변혁은 이미 시작되었고 막연히 상상했던 미래는 이미 눈앞에 다가와 있다. 살아남고, 소멸하고, 변화하는 속도가 더욱 빨라지는 시대, 이 책은 변곡점에 선 세상과 새로운 기회를 한 발 앞서 읽어낼 서슬 퍼런 인사이트를 선보인다.

코딩 인터뷰는 어색한 공간, 낯선 면접관 앞에서 이루어진다. 후회 없이 인터뷰를 마치려면 평소에 난이도와 주제별로 다양한 문제를 풀며 철저히 준비해 두어야 한다. 이 책은 면접관으로 수많은 인터뷰를 해 온 저자들이 집필한 소프트웨어 개발 인터뷰의 종합 안내서다.

자료구조, 탐색, 정렬, 알고리즘 설계 원칙 및 동시성 등에 관련된 문제를 장별로 제시한다. 각 장은 먼저, 문제를 풀기 위해 꼭 알고 있어야 할 내용, 중요한 라이브러리 함수 등을 설명한다. 그 후 실전처럼 문제를 분석하고 답을 내고 코드를 보여 준다. 해당 문제에 대한 설명이 끝나면 비슷한 응용 문제를 제시해 배운 내용을 한 번 더 단단히 할 수 있다.

스타트업에서 빅테크 기업까지 실리콘밸리 면접관이 전하는 코딩 인터뷰 노하우. 코딩 인터뷰는 어색한 공간, 낯선 면접관 앞에서 이루어진다. 이 책은 면접관으로 수많은 인터뷰를 해 온 저자들이 집필한 소프트웨어 개발 인터뷰의 종합 안내서다.

자료구조, 탐색, 정렬, 알고리즘 설계 원칙 및 동시성 등에 관련된 문제를 장별로 제시한다. 각 장은 먼저, 문제를 풀기 위해 꼭 알고 있어야 할 내용, 중요한 라이브러리 함수 등을 설명한다. 그 후 실전처럼 문제를 분석하고 답을 내고 코드를 보여 준다. 해당 문제에 대한 설명이 끝나면 비슷한 응용 문제를 제시해 배운 내용을 한 번 더 단단히 할 수 있다.

2021년 대한민국은 2020년에 이어 코로나19 팬데믹의 타격으로 휘청거릴 수밖에 없었다. 2020년이 유례없는 역병의 발생에 허둥지둥하며 대응책 마련에 바빴다면, 2021년은 확진자가 늘고 사회적 거리두기가 강화되면서 자영 업계의 손실과 시민들의 피로감이 극에 달했다. 동시에 하반기에 들어서며 백신 접종률이 늘어나 ‘위드 코로나(With Corona)’, 즉 코로나19 바이러스와의 공존을 모색하려는 기대감이 커진 것도 사실이다.

설령 2022년 위드 코로나 정책이 잘 자리 잡아 경제와 산업이 다시 정상화된다고 하더라도 그것이 코로나19 이전으로의 복귀를 의미하지는 않을 것이다. 많은 것이 이미 달라졌고, 앞으로 그 변화는 오히려 더 요동칠 것이다. 하지만 늘 그랬듯, 삶은 어떻게든 방법을 찾아내기 마련이다.

그렇다면 이러한 격변에 우리는 어떻게 대응할 것인가? 용맹하고 거침없는 호랑이의 기세가 기대되는 2022년, 『트렌드 코리아 2022』은 반전의 시작을 알리는 변화의 징후들을 포착하는 데 결정적인 도움을 줄 것이다.
