                    <span>Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Lawler: More on Investor Purchases of Single-Family Homes
A brief excerpt: 
From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Recent reports showing a surge in investor purchases of single-family homes beginning last spring has stunned quite a few housing analysts and led several to reassess the “drivers” of the surprising strength in housing and home prices this year.
One of the reports I’m referring to is from Redfin, and the other is from CoreLogic. While both are based on an analysis of property records, there are key differences.
Before going into some of the potential ramifications of this investor surge, however, I thought it might be useful to discuss these reports – especially in light of a recent “research” report from the trade association “dedicated to advocating on behalf of the single-family rental industry” that completed botched its analysis of these recent reports.

                    <span>We consider a version of the imperfect competition model of Butters (1977), Varian (1980) and Burdett and Judd (1983) in which sellers make an ex-ante investment in the quality of their variety of the product. Equilibrium exists, is unique and is efficient. In equilibrium, search frictions not only cause sellers to offer different surpluses to buyers but also cause sellers to choose different qualities for their varieties. That is, equilibrium involves endogenous vertical differentiation. As search frictions decline, the market becomes more and more unequal as a smaller and smaller fraction of sellers produces varieties of increasing quality, offers increasing surplus to their customers, and captures an increasing share of the market, while a growing fraction of sellers produces varieties of decreasing quality. Gains from trade and welfare grow. Under some conditions, the growth rate of gains from trade and welfare is constant.</span>

                    <span>Advanced economies feature complicated networks that connect households, ﬁrms, and regions. How do these structures aﬀect the impact of ﬁscal policy and its optimal targeting? We study these questions in a model with input-output linkages, regional structure, and household heterogeneity in MPCs, consumption baskets, and shock exposures. Theoretically, we derive estimable formulae for the eﬀects of ﬁscal policies on aggregate GDP, or ﬁscal multipliers, and show how network structures determine their size. Empirically, we ﬁnd that multipliers vary substantially across policies, so targeting is important. Beneath these aggregate eﬀects are large spatial and sectoral spillovers from policies directed to any one ﬁrm or household. However, virtually all variation in multipliers stems from diﬀerences in policies’ direct incidence onto households’ MPCs. Thus, while the distributional eﬀects of ﬁscal policy depend on the detailed structure of the economy, maximally expansionary ﬁscal policy simply targets households’ MPCs.</span>

                    <span>In the mid-19th century, the urban milk supply in the United States was regularly skimmed or diluted with water, reducing its nutritional value. At the urging of public health experts, cities across the country hired milk inspectors, who were tasked with collecting and analyzing milk samples with the goal of preventing adulteration and skimming. Using city-level data for the period 1880-1910, we explore the effects of milk inspections on infant mortality and mortality among children under the age of 5. Event-study estimates are small and statistically insignificant, providing little evidence of post-treatment reductions in either infant or child mortality.</span>

                    <span>We show that “preemptive” capital flow management measures (CFM) can reduce emerging markets and developing countries’ (EMDE) external finance premia during risk-off shocks, especially for vulnerable countries. Using a panel dataset of 56 EMDEs during 1996–2020 at monthly frequency, we document that countries with preemptive policies in place during the five year window before risk-off shocks experienced relatively lower external finance premia and exchange rate volatility during the shock compared to countries which did not have such pre-emptive policies in place. We use the episodes of Taper Tantrum and COVID-19 as risk-off shocks. Our identification relies on a difference-in-differences methodology with country fixed effects where preemptive policies are ex-ante by construction and cannot be put in place as a response to the shock ex-post. We control the effects of other policies, such as monetary policy, foreign exchange interventions (FXI), easing of inflow CFMs and tightening of outflow CFMs that are used in response to the risk-off shocks. By reducing the impact of risk-off shocks on countries’ funding costs and exchange rate volatility, preemptive policies enable countries’ continued access to international capital markets during troubled times.</span>

                    <span>Workers wrongly anchor their beliefs about outside options on their current wage. In particular, low-paid workers underestimate wages elsewhere. We document this anchoring bias by eliciting workers’ beliefs in a representative survey in Germany and comparing them to measures of actual outside options in linked administrative labor market data. In an equilibrium model, such anchoring can give rise to monopsony and labor market segmentation. In line with the model, misperceptions are particularly pronounced among workers in low-wage firms. If workers had correct beliefs, at least 10% of jobs, concentrated in low-wage firms, would not be viable at current wages.</span>

                    <span>We provide the first evidence that spatial variation in all-cause mortality risk is capitalized into US housing prices. Using a hedonic framework, we recover the annual implicit cost of a 0.1 percentage-point reduction in mortality risk among older Americans and find that this figure is both relatively low and decreasing in age, from $1,346 for a 67 year old to $246 for an 87 year old. These estimates are one-fifth of the size of comparable estimates found in the labor market, suggesting that the housing market provides an alternative, substantially cheaper channel to reducing mortality risk.</span>

                    <span>Despite escalating disaster losses and predicted increases in weather-related catastrophes, takeup of protective technologies and behaviors appears limited by myopia, externalities, and other factors. One response to such frictions is to mandate adaptive investment. We measure the effect of California&#x27;s wildfire building codes on own- and neighboring structure survival using administrative damage and assessment data for most US homes experiencing wildfires since 2000. Differences across jurisdictions and vintages reveal remarkable resilience effects of building codes initially prompted by the deadly 1991 Oakland Firestorm. Codes also benefit neighbors. We use the results to estimate net social benefits of wildfire building standards.</span>

                    <span>This paper explores methods for inferring the causal effects of treatments on choices by combining data on real choices with hypothetical evaluations. We propose a class of estimators, identify conditions under which they yield consistent estimates, and derive their asymptotic distributions. The approach is applicable in settings where standard methods cannot be used (e.g., due to the absence of helpful instruments, or because the treatment has not been implemented). It can recover heterogeneous treatment effects more comprehensively, and can improve precision. We provide proof of concept using data generated in a laboratory experiment and through a field application.</span>

                    <span>This paper focuses on the price of nails since 1695 and the proximate source of changes in those prices. Why nails? They are a basic manufactured product whose form and quality have changed relatively little over the last three centuries, yet the process for producing them has changed dramatically. Accordingly, nails provide a useful prism through which to examine a wide range of economic and technological developments that touch on multiple areas of both micro- and macroeconomics. Several conclusions emerge. First, from the late 1700s to the mid 20th century real nail prices fell by a factor of about 10 relative to overall consumer prices. These declines had important effects on downstream industries, most notably construction. Second, while declining materials prices contribute to reductions in nail prices, the largest proximate source of the decline during this period was multifactor productivity growth in nail manufacturing, highlighting the role of the specialization of labor and re-organization of production processes. Third, the share of nails in GDP dropped back from 0.4 percent of GDP in 1810—comparable to today’s share of household purchases of personal computers—to a de minimis share more recently; accordingly, nails played a bigger role in American life in that earlier period. Finally, real nail prices have increased since the mid 20th century, reflecting in part an upturn in materials prices and a shift toward specialty nails in the wake of import competition, though the introduction of nail guns partly offset these increases for the price of installed nails.</span>

                    <span>This paper documents novel evidence on the influence of political incentives in the regulatory enforcement of foreign bribery. Using exogenous variation in the timing and geographic location of U.S. Congressional elections, we find that the probability of a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement action against foreign firms located in the Senator’s jurisdiction increases significantly pre-election, spiking 23%, with zero equivalent move for equivalently global (but domestic-headquartered) firms in the Senator’s jurisdiction. Using hand-collected case-level data from the U.S. SEC and DOJ, we also observe larger discretion in regions where foreign firms are larger global competitors of in-state firms, operate in locally important industries, and when Senators serve as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee (which oversees the DOJ). Anti-bribery enforcement has electoral implications, leading to spikes in media coverage of the FCPA enforcement coupled with greater vote shares for the Senator. Moreover, the cases pushed through against these foreign firms just prior to elections appear to be weaker cases. The enforcements result in real effects, as in response to strategic timing in enforcement, firms reallocate business segments and sales.</span>

                    <span>The credit sensitivity of LIBOR helped lenders during the financial crisis. SOFR is not credit-sensitive and would not have provided that support. The cumulative additional interest from LIBOR during the crisis is estimated to be between 1% to 2% of the notional amount of outstanding loans, depending on the tenor and type of SOFR rate used. The amount of LIBOR business loans owned by banks could have been as high as about 2trn, and the overall additional interest income banks received thanks to LIBOR could have been as high as 30bn dollars. The analysis also shows that a compounded SOFR reduces insurance relative to a term SOFR.</span>

                    <span>Treatment intensity varies remarkably across physicians, yet the key drivers are not well understood. Meanwhile, the organization of healthcare is undergoing a secular transformation as physicians increasingly work in groups. This paper tests whether physicians&#x27; group affiliation matters for practice styles and patient health. Using Medicare inpatient claims data, we compare these outcomes before and after physicians switch between groups of varying treatment intensity while remaining in the same hospital to control for practice setting. Event studies show that internists who join more-intensive groups immediately increase their own treatment intensity, with an elasticity of approximately 0.3; the opposite is found for internists who switch to groups that are less intensive. This change in Medicare spending largely stems from greater quantities of care provided, with some evidence of a change in coding behavior.  We do not detect a change in health outcomes, suggesting that treatment intensity induced by group affiliation may not be productive.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we empirically assess the causal links between trade and individual income risk and study the role that human capital plays in this relationship using a rich, worker-level, longitudinal data set from Germany spanning 1976 to 2012. Our estimates suggest substantial heterogeneity in labor income risk across workers in different entry cohorts and across workers with different levels of industry- and occupation-specific human capital. Our findings suggest that within-industry changes in imports and exports are causally related to income risk: Imports increase risk and exports decrease risk, and they do so in an economically significant manner. Importantly, we find there to be a complex interplay between human capital and the linkage between trade and risk: While, on average, individuals with higher levels of industry- or occupation-specific human capital experience lower income risk, a given increase in net-imports exposure in an industry increases risk for workers with higher levels of industry tenure more than it does for workers with lower levels of industry tenure. High levels of industry-specific human capital can be costly for workers in highly trade-exposed industries. By contrast, we find no evidence of any interaction between risk, industry trade exposure, and occupation-specific human capital.</span>

                    <span>Blackouts impose substantial economic costs in developing countries. This paper advances a new explanation for their continued prevalence: unlike in high-income countries, where regulatory mandates require utilities to satisfy all electricity demand, utilities in developing countries respond to wholesale electricity prices. As a result, misallocation of output across power plants can decrease the quantity of electricity supplied to end-users. We provide empirical support for this explanation using novel data from India, home to the world’s third-largest electricity sector. In contrast to the developed world, we find that Indian wholesale demand is downward-sloping. Reducing supply-side misallocation would increase electricity supply for the average household by 1.7 percent (enough to power 4.6 million additional households). Justifying a mandate that utilities must satisfy all end-use demand would require consumers to value electricity far above the cost of diesel backup generation. However, such a mandate would likely be cost-effective if paired with supply-side reforms.</span>

                    <span>We examine the impacts of physician-hospital integration on care fragmentation and other measures of care-coordination using a dynamic model of movers and stayers in commercially insured plans. Although recent growth in the share of practicing physicians belonging to these vertical organizations has sparked considerable policy debate, there is a paucity of evidence on the merits of vertical integration in the private segment of the market. We fill the gap by focusing on care-coordination in the relatively open plans that dominate commercial insurance, namely Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). We exploit the fact that physician-hospital integration levels vary dramatically across MSA and focus on orthogonal employment-based transfers for identification. We track 415,000 beneficiaries with 17 million claims between 2010 and 2016. We find that standard two-way fixed effect mover-stayer models produce biased estimates since there are heterogeneous effects of integration. Extending the dynamic event study design of Sun and Abraham (2021) to mover-stayer analyses, we are able to avoid these biases. We find that a move from the 10th to 90th percentile of physician integration level causes a 20% relative decrease in a care fragmentation index; similar declines are found in independent markers of fragmentation such as use of out-of-network and single-service facilities. Vertical integration of either primary care physicians or specialists reduced fragmentation significantly. However, only vertical integration of specialists led to significant reductions in medical spending. Our results are robust when adjusting for moves associated with alternative contractual arrangements among providers that do not require outright ownership.</span>

                    <span>One-fifth of U.S. high school students report being bullied each year. We use internet search data for real-time tracking of bullying patterns as COVID-19 disrupted in-person schooling. We first show that, prepandemic, internet searches contain useful information about actual bullying behavior. We then show that searches for school bullying and cyberbullying dropped 30-35 percent as schools shifted to remote learning in spring 2020. The gradual return to in-person instruction starting in fall 2020 partially returns bullying searches to pre-pandemic levels. This rare positive effect may partly explain recent mixed evidence on the pandemic’s impact on students’ mental health and well-being.</span>

                    <span>This chapter was prepared for the Handbook of International Economics (Vol. 5) edited by Gita Gopinath, Elhanan Helpman, and Kenneth Rogoff. We provide a review of the recent literature -- both theoretical and empirical -- analyzing the multi-dimensional connections between globalization and innovation. We develop a model that features many of those mechanisms that connect trade and innovation. It features the joint selection of firms into innovation and international market participation (in our model, we restrict that participation to exports). Our model also highlights how exposure to international markets affects the incentives for innovation.</span>

                    <span>Progress in rights for homosexual and bisexual individuals has varied substantially across the world. This column uses an information treatment experiment to examine the determinants of support for sexual minorities in three countries with some of the lowest rates of social acceptance in Europe – Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It finds that when informed about the economic costs of discrimination, individuals in countries with strong views about the immorality of homosexuality can still voice support for non-discrimination policies. In addition, views about the acceptability of homosexuality itself can be modestly affected by the provision of basic information, particularly when framed in the context of institutions that people trust.</span>

                    <span>Are preference differences between men and women attenuated or accentuated in more gender-equal societies? Using information on the shares of male and female Facebook users that are interested in over 45,000 different topics, this column finds that differences are larger in gender-equal societies for interests that are systematically biased towards the same gender across the globe (such as football, war, or children), while the opposite is true for interests that do not show a gender bias (such as fitness, travel, or horses). These contrasting results are consistent with both evolutionary psychology and social role theory.</span>

For intermodal, 2021 was the tale of two halves. The first six months of 2021 saw record-breaking highs, but volume cooled in the second half as global supply chain challenges persisted. For all of 2021,  U.S. railroads originated 14.14 million containers and trailers — up 5.1% over 2020, up 3.4% over 2019, and  the second most ever for a full year. Only 2018’s 14.47 million was higher.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
U.S. railroads originated 1.14 million total  carloads in December 2021, up 3.1% over December  2020 and down 0.7% from December 2019. December  was the tenth straight overall year-over-year gain and  the fifth straight in the 2%-4% range.
The second graph shows the six week average (not monthly) of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
Meanwhile, U.S. railroads originated 1.22 million  intermodal containers and trailers in December 2021,  down 8.2% from December 2020 and the fifth straight  year-over-year decline. Volume averaged 244,956 units  per week in December 2021, the fewest since May 2020. (December is typically one of the lowest-volume  intermodal months of the year.)</span>

                    <span>From CoStar: US Hotels Set Performance Records Over Holidays
U.S. hotel demand for the week between the Christmas and New Year’s Eve holidays was the highest ever recorded, and hoteliers capitalized, charging record-high weekly rates.
Christmas Day hotel occupancy also set a record in the U.S. at 47.3%; the previous peak was 47%, reached in 2015. New Year’s Eve hotel performance was likely limited by the rise in COVID-19 cases linked to the omicron variant, which resulted in limitations or outright cancellations of many large-scale celebrations. Occupancy on that day rose to 62%, which was higher than in 2019 (59.4%), but well below the peak set in 2016 (68.7%).
Occupancy for the seven-day period between Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve was 53.7%, which also was not a record and slightly below the level achieved in 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red dot is for 2022, black is 2020, blue is the median, and dashed light blue is for 2021.

Although down compared to 2019, the 4-week average of the occupancy rate is now above the median rate for the previous 20 years (Blue).


Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The 4-week average of the occupancy rate will increase seasonally over the next few months.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Rents Still Increasing Sharply Year-over-year
A brief excerpt: 
Here is a graph of the year-over-year (YoY) change for these measures since January 2015. All of these measures are through November 2021 (Apartment List through December).
...
The Zillow measure is up 12.6% YoY in November, up from 12.0% YoY in October. And the ApartmentList measure is up 17.8% as of December, up from 17.7% in November. Both the Zillow measure (a repeat rent index), and ApartmentList are showing a sharp increase in rents.
Clearly rents are increasing sharply, and we should expect this to continue to spill over into measures of inflation in 2022. The Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) was up 3.5% YoY in November, from 3.1% in November - and will increase further in the coming months.

Leisure and hospitality gained 53 thousand jobs in December.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.22 million jobs, and are now down 1.22 million jobs since February 2020.  So, leisure and hospitality has now added back about 85% all of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment increased 22 thousand and is now 88 thousand below the pre-pandemic level.

This graph shows the daily (columns) and 7-day average (line) of positive tests reported.

New cases are at record levels.  It appears likely hospitalizations will exceed the previous 7-day average record of 124,031 a year ago.


Fortunately, deaths are still well below the previous 7-day average record of 3,421 in January 2021.</span>

‘한국은행의 돈 박사’라 불리는 신상준 박사의 ‘돈의 본질’에 대한 인문학적 이야기다. ‘돈이란 무엇인가?’에 대한 해답을 찾아가며, 돈의 모든 것에 대해 강의하듯 설명하고 있다. 야프섬의 돌화폐에서 비트코인까지 돈에 대한 모든 것을 다루면서도, 돈을 통해 흐르는 경제 문제까지 짚어준다.

“종잇조각에 불과한 우리의 지폐가 야프섬의 돌화폐보다 더 큰 가치를 가지고 있을까? 우리의 예금은 어떠한가? 전자적으로만 이체되는 우리의 예금이 구두로만 이전되는 야프섬의 돌화폐와 크게 다를까?”

저자 신상준 박사는 이와 같은 화두를 던지며 독자들과 대화를 시도한다. 돈의 근저에 깔린 ‘가치의 본질’에 대해 이야기하고, 주관적 가치를 객관적 객체에 고정시키고자 한 ‘화폐의 역사’에 대해 이야기한다. 그리고 시대마다 상이한 ‘돈의 철학’과 이를 통해 형성된 ‘돈의 본질’에 대한 다양한 견해를 나눈다. 더 나아가 돈을 둘러싼 ‘권력과 돈의 이데올로기’에 대해 이야기한다.

                    <span>Bitcoin’s market capitalisation reached new peaks in November 2021. This column suggests it is hard to find arguments supporting the cryptocurrency’s current valuation. Even if the financial stability risks of a Bitcoin collapse could be contained, the burst of the bubble would imply painful losses for many retail investors and society at large. The authors conclude that public authorities should refrain from taking measures supporting additional investment flows into Bitcoin and should treat it as rigorously as the conventional financial industry to combat illicit payments, money laundering, and terrorist financing.</span>

This column analyses the role of language frictions in impeding transfers of management knowledge within multinationals using survey and experimental evidence from Myanmar. It finds that potential employers value higher English efficiency and prior multinational experience, and an English language course treatment is shown to improve the English ability of domestic managers, increase their interactions with foreign managers, and increase their involvement in the management of company personnel.</span>

• First, currently there are still about 3.9 million fewer jobs than in February 2020 (before the pandemic).
This graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms.  However, the current employment recession, 20 months after the onset, is now significantly better than the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.

                    <span>(Posted with permission).  The December ISM® Services index was at 62.0%, down from 69.1% last month. The employment index decreased to 54.9%, from 56.5%.  Note: Above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 in contraction. 
From the Institute for Supply Management: Services PMI® at 62% December 2021 Services ISM® Report On Business® 
Economic activity in the services sector grew in December for the 19th month in a row — with the Services PMI® exceeding 60 percent for the 10th consecutive month — say the nation’s purchasing and supply executives in the latest Services ISM® Report On Business®.
The report was issued today by Anthony Nieves, CPSM, C.P.M., A.P.P., CFPM, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management® (ISM®) Services Business Survey Committee: “In December, the Services PMI® registered 62 percent, 7.1 percentage points below November’s all-time high reading of 69.1 percent. The Business Activity Index registered 67.6 percent, a decrease of 7 percentage points compared to the reading of 74.6 percent in November, and the New Orders Index registered 61.5 percent, 8.2 percentage points lower than the all-time high reading of 69.7 percent reported in November.
   emphasis added
This was below the consensus forecast, and the employment index decreased to 54.9%, from 56.5% the previous month.</span>

Both exports and imports increased in November. 
Exports are up 21% compared to November 2020; imports are up 21% compared to November 2020.
Both imports and exports decreased sharply due to COVID-19, and have now bounced back (imports more than exports),
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit, with and without petroleum.
 The blue line is the total deficit, and the black line is the petroleum deficit, and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products.
Note that net, imports and exports of petroleum products are close to zero.
The trade deficit with China increased to $32.3 billion in November, from $30.6 billion in November 2020.</span>

                    <span>Early signs of a recession can lead to a negative feedback loop, with workers&#x27; concerns about unemployment dampening demand and thus deepening the recession. This column uses a heterogeneous agent model to quantify the importance of the ‘unemployment-risk’ channel for business cycle fluctuations in the US economy. It shows that the channel accounts for around one-third of observed unemployment fluctuations. As the demand amplification through precautionary savings is inefficient, this finding provides an additional rationale for stabilisation policies by policymakers.</span>

However, higher salaries can also make candidates too expensive to justify a callback. The authors find evidence that such policies can equalise some outcomes across genders, but sometimes as a result of reductions for men rather than raises for women.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Apartment Vacancy Rate Declined in Q4
A brief excerpt: 
Reis reported that the apartment vacancy rate was at 4.7% in Q4 2021, down from 4.8% in Q3, and down from a pandemic peak of 5.4% in Q1 2021. 
This graph shows the apartment vacancy rate starting in 1980. (Annual rate before 1999, quarterly starting in 1999).   Note: Reis is just for large cities.
Reis also reported the asking rents were up 2.8% in Q4 compared to Q3, and up 11.9% year-over-year.  Rents were down year-over-year through Q2 2021 (due to the pandemic) and picked up sharply in Q3.  Even with the recent surge in rents, rents are only up 4.5% annualized over the last 2 years (since rents decreased early in the pandemic).

                    <span>Reis reported the office vacancy rate was at 18.1% in Q4 2021, down from 18.2% in Q3, and up from 17.8% in Q4 2020. 


Q2 2021 saw the highest vacancy rate for offices since the early &#x27;90s at 18.5% (following the S&amp;L crisis).

The first graph shows the office vacancy rate starting in 1980 (prior to 1999 the data is annual).

The office vacancy rate was elevated prior to the pandemic and moved up during the pandemic.

Reis also reported that office effective rents were unchanged in Q4; rents are about the same rate as early 2019.

                    <span>The BEA released their estimate of light vehicle sales for December today.  The BEA estimates sales of 12.44 million SAAR in December 2021 (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate), down 3.3% from the November sales rate, and down 23.8% from December 2020.

The first graph shows annual sales since 1976.
Light vehicle sales in 2021 were at 14.93 million, up 3.1% from 14.47 million in 2020.
  
Sales in 2021 were impacted significantly by supply chain disruptions, and sales were still down 12% from the 2019 level.


This suggests vehicle sales will increase in 2022 and boost GDP.

                    <span>From ADP:
Private sector employment increased by 807,000 jobs from   November to December according to the December ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly  distributed to the public each month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by  the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from  ADP’s actual data of those who are on a company’s payroll, measures the change in total nonfarm private  employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis
“December’s job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicron’s impact  had yet to be seen,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP. “Job gains were broad-based, as  goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.  December’s job growth brought the fourth quarter average to 625,000, surpassing the 514,000 average  for the year. While job gains eclipsed 6 million in 2021, private sector payrolls are still nearly 4 million jobs  short of pre-COVID-19 levels.
emphasis added
  This was well above the consensus forecast of 413,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 400 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in December.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.</span>

After April 2020, sales increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic).  


However, sales decreased earlier this year due to supply issues. It appears the &quot;supply chain bottom&quot; was in September, but sales in December were disappointing again.</span>

In addition, they do so in a more inclusive way than manufacturing. Policymakers need to invest in human capital and address regulatory barriers to services trade to make the most of this development.</span>

                    <span>The use of economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool has increased sharply over the past decade. Drawing a comparison with the first sanction decade of the 1990s, this column analyses the drivers of the recent sanction wave and argues that the increased use of economic sanctions will be sustained in the foreseeable future.</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 resulted in a shift towards working from home. This column discusses the findings of a survey of over 2,000 UK working adults, which suggest that online meetings are more efficient for smaller gatherings of 2 to 4 people, while in-person meetings are preferred for gatherings of 10 or more. Online efficiency is also dependent on demographics, with women and more educated employees reporting that online meetings are relatively more efficient. Unsurprisingly, employees who work from home more and with good internet quality also report higher relative online meeting efficiency.</span>

현대적 C++의 시작인 C++11 이후 가장 큰 개정이 이루어진 표준이 바로 C++20이다. C++20은 현대적 C++의 프로그래밍 방식 자체를 바꾼다. 《C++20: 풍부한 예제로 익히는 핵심 기능》에서는 이 혁신적인 변화의 핵심인 네 가지 주요 기능(콘셉츠, 모듈, 구간 라이브러리, 코루틴)을 설명한다. 이 외에도 언어 자체에 추가된 주요 기능, 라이브러리, 동시성 관련 기능을 정리해 놓았다. 기능을 나열하는 데 그치지 않고 모든 기능마다 예제를 들어 설명해서 명확하게 이해할 수 있도록 돕고 있다.

C 언어를 비롯하여 프로그래밍을 처음 시작하는 학생에게 최적화된 교재다. C 언어의 핵심 개념을 일상 속 비유와 그림을 통해 시각적으로 설명하며, C 언어의 문법 자체보다 동작 원리에 집중하였다. 또한 본문이 끝날 때마다 수록된 [확인문제]와 실습 문제 [LAB]을 통해 본문의 내용을 자연스럽게 복습할 수 있다. 마지막으로 챕터가 끝날 때마다 완성도 높은 [실전예제]를 직접 실습하면서 해당 챕터에서 배운 C 언어의 종합적인 내용을 자신의 것으로 만들 수 있다.

코로나 이후 우리가 일하는 모습을 상상해보자. 마이크로소프트사의 홀로렌즈를 머리에 장착하고 현실 세계에 가상 세계를 융합한 혼합 현실에서 원격회의를 진행한다. 구글 줌을 통해 캘리포니아에 사는 존과 화상 회의를 진행한다. AI가 실시간 통역을 해줘 의사소통에 전혀 불편을 느끼지 못한다.  크라우드 스트라이크사의 완벽한 클라우드 보안으로 개인 컴퓨터를 사용해도 해킹의 염려가 없다.

사무실에 출근하는 날은 아마존의 로보택시를 이용한다. 아마존은 2020년에 자율주행 기술을 연구하는 벤처 기업 Zoox를 인수한 후 이 사업을 추진해왔다. 로보택시 안에 설치된 모니터에서는 아마존이 고객으로부터 얻은 빅데이터를 바탕으로 맞춤형 광고 영상이 나온다. 출장을 가게 될 때는 애플호텔에 묵는다. 호텔 방의 터치 패널에 아이폰을 갖다 대면, 환기 조절, 조명, 음향 등이 자신이 원하는 환경으로 바뀐다. 비용은 추가 할인을 받을 수 있는 애플카드로 결제한다. 점심으로 콩고기로 된 스테이크를 먹고, 쉬는 시간에는 넷플릭스에서 내 취향에 맞게 결말이 바뀐 영화를 본다.

위의 내용은 《빅테크 미래보고서 2025》의 서두에서 그려본 미래 모습의 일부분이다. 추측과 가정으로 이루어져 있지만, 빅테크 기업의 기술과 비즈니스가 앞으로 어떠한 방향으로…</span>

〈이코노미스트〉가 꼽은 2022년 새해 경제 주요 이슈들이다. 이에 대한 전망과 향방을 내다본 『2022 경제 대예측』을 펴냈다. 〈이코노미스트〉는 중앙일보·JTBC 등으로 이뤄진 중앙그룹이 발행하는 프리미엄 경제 전문 뉴스로 1984년 창간해 한국의 경제 발전 역사와 함께 걸어왔다. 최근에는 경제 매거진에 이어 온라인 데일리 경제 뉴스도 제작해 매일 매일 독자들에게 경제 소식을 전하고 있다. 

〈이코노미스트〉가 제작하는 『경제 대예측』은 2008년 출판 등록해 지금까지 해마다 발행하고 있는 대내외 경제 전망서다. 지난해 경제 상황을 돌아보고 새해 경제 쟁점을 전망하는 책이다. 경제 현장에서 뛰고 있는 경제 전문 기자들이 낱낱이 해부한 분석력과, 관련 업계의 정책·통계·동향 등을 통해 현상을 꿰뚫는 경제기관 전문가들의 통찰력으로 대내외 경제 이정표를 제시하는 전망서다. 

이들의 시각을 통해 Yes와 No의 답변과 확률로 가능성을 제시하고 있다. 2021년초에 펴낸 『2021 경제 대예측』은 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)의 전세계 대유행으로 셧다운(정지) 된 세계경제에 대해 2021년에는 ‘V자형 반등’으로 회복할 것으로 전망했으며 이 예측은 적중했다.

2020년 3월 1일, 안드로이드 스튜디오의 버전 번호 시스템이 인텔리제이 IDEA와 일치하도록 연도 표기로 변경되었다. 또한 각 버전 이름도 A~Z로 시작하는 동물의 이름으로 변경되어 기존의 &#x27;안드로이드 스튜디오 4.3&#x27; 버전이 &#x27;안드로이드 스튜디오 Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1&#x27;로 바뀌었다. 이러한 변화에 맞춰 개정 3판을 펴냈다.

3판에서는 Arctic Fox 추가 기능을 모두 반영했으며, Bumblebee와 Chipmunk 베타 버전에서도 실습할 수 있다. 그리고 안드로이드에서 더는 사용하지 않는 구형 코틀린 코드를 수정했다. 또한 파이어베이스 실습 프로젝트(클라우드 메시징(FCM) 등)를 추가했다. 최신 버전으로 실습 환경을 제공한다.

경제학이 담지 못한 ‘행복’의 본질을 찾아서, 진정한 행복은 자신의 잠재력을 실현하는 것이다. 현대 한국인의 행복에는 크게 두 가지 문제가 있다. 평균 행복도가 낮은 것과 연령대가 높아질수록 행복도가 하락하는 것. 저자는 인간의 행복은 자신이 사는 사회체제와 무관하지 않다는 생각을 바탕으로 이러한 저행복의 원인을 시장경제 체제에서 찾는다. 교육, 직장 등 삶의 주요한 영역에서 이루어지는 경쟁이 협력과 공감의 감정을 사라지게 했고, 가까운 사람들마저 경쟁자로 여기면서 행복에 중요한 영향을 주는 관계재가 줄어들었다는 것이다.

저자는 그동안 경제학에서 제시한 다양한 행복의 정의를 비판적으로 검토하면서 경제학이 담지 못한 행복의 본질은 무엇인가 질문을 던진다. 경제학자들의 주장대로 실질소득이 증가하여 소비가 크게 확대되었지만 행복은 상승하지 않았다. 오히려 점점 심화되는 불평등과 차별이 행복을 낮추고 있다. 이에 저자는 기존 경제학의 틀을 넘어서는 새로운 시각으로 행복을 정의한다.

 “진정한 행복은 자신의 잠재력을 실현하는 것”이라는 저자의 행복 정의는 경제학의 각종 지표들이 담지 못한 실제 우리 삶의 이야기면서, 시장경제 체제의 산물도 아니며, 소확행보다 더 넓은 시선으로 인생 전체를 그릴 수 있게 한다. 즉 행복을 내적인 감정이 아닌 현실을 바라보는 시각으로서 제시한 것이다. 이때 자기실현은 홀로 깨달음을 통해 얻는 것이 아니라 사회 속에서 성취하는 것이다. 사회구성원으로서 각자가 자기실현을 위해 노력하고, 서로 협력할수록 행복은 커진다.

대한민국의 불평등을 객관적인 통계를 통해 파헤친 최초의 책이다. 대한민국의 불평등 지표인 가처분소득과 지니계수, 상대적 빈곤율은 OECD 회원국 가운데서 맨 밑바닥에 있다. 이러한 문제는 대한민국이 선진국에 진입했다고 해서 해소되지 않는다. 

이 책은 우리나라가 성장과 발전을 거듭해오는 동안 놓친 노동, 청년, 지방의 불평등은 무엇인지를 통계 제시로 보여준다. 또한, 각종 배제와 소외에 놓인 여성, 노인 그리고 소수자의 삶을 통계를 분석하며 꼼꼼히 살핀다.

선진국 대한민국의 국민은 과연 행복한가? 왜 그들은 늘 힘들고 불안한 삶을 살고 있는가? 그들은 어떤 상황에 놓여 있으며, 그렇게 된 원인은 무엇일까? 이는 곧 불평등의 근원인 노동의 문제로 귀결된다. 『불평등한 선진국』은 대한민국의 노동 현실을 다층적인 통계를 통해서 보여준다. 나아가 저자는 불평등의 중심에 있는 청년 문제를, 소득과 교육 불평등의 통계로  그것의 구조화를 규명한다. 한편 이 책은 우리 사회의 소수자인 결혼 이주 여성과 이주 노동자, 장애인과 여성의 구체적 모습을 놓치지 않는다. 

불평등 문제는 어떻게 해결되어야 하는가? 『불평등한 선진국』은 먼저 대한민국의 불평등을 통계로 볼 것을 제안하고 촉구한다. 그것이 우리의 현실에 대한 고민의 시작이며 대안에 대한 모색이기 때문이다.

한국의 경제ㆍ사회 현실과 다가올 미래의 맥락에서 우리 교육을 경제학적 관점에서 평가하고 분석한 책이다. 특히 효율성, 형평성, 타당성이라는 세 가지 평가 기준을 가지고 우리나라 교육의 역사적 흐름과 현주소를 진단하고, 나아가 피라미드형 교육경쟁사회의 입시제도, 사교육 및 사회자본의 현실 및 문제의 진단과 분석, 인공지능 시대의 교육의 방향과 대안 등을 실증적 연구 데이터에 대한 분석과 현장의 교육 실험 등을 통해 제시한다.

2009년 조사 기준 우리나라 학생들의 주당 공부시간은 초등학생은 44시간, 중학생 52시간, 고등학생 64시간. 2019년 OECD 국가 기준 수학 점수 1위, 그러나 학습효율성지수는 꼴지!  비효율적인 선행ㆍ반복학습 위주의 공부 중노동을 강제하는 교육 외적인 현실에 대한 분석과 왜곡된 사회구조에 대한 진단과 분석을 통해 우리 교육의 문제점을 살펴보고 교육의 효율성과 타당성, 형평성의 관계를 생각해본다.

국가들 간의 상이한 경제성장률은 각국에서의 ‘분배연합들’과 ‘특별이익집단들’을 명시적으로 살펴봄으로써 이해될 수 있다. 오랫동안 정해진 경계선이 변하지 않은 ‘안정된 사회들’에서 시간이 지남에 따라 더 많은 분배연합들이 축적됨으로써 그 사회의 경제적 효율성과 경제성장에 해로운 영향을 미쳐서 궁극적으로 ‘제도경화증’(institutional sclerosis)이 초래되고, 마침내 국가는 쇠퇴의 길을 걷게 된다.

넷플릭스를 통해 세상을 강타한 ‘오징어 게임’은 사실 ‘제로섬 게임’이다. 내가 이기면 네가 지고 네가 이기면 내가 지는 그런 게임 말이다. 제로섬 게임은 두 개인, 두 기업 등 두 주체 간의 이기고 지는 게임이기도 하지만, 이기는 주체도 지는 주체도 여럿인 게임이기도 하다. 그래서 제로섬 게임에서는 주체들이 얻은 이익을 순서대로 줄을 세워 석차로 나타낼 수 있다. 이익의 양이 아니라 석차만이 의미가 있다.
이 책에서 내가 주장하고 싶은 본질은 후반부의 대책 편에 있다. 혹시나 앞 편을 읽다가 후반부는 읽지 않으면 어쩌나 염려된다. 궁금하신 분들은 후반부터 읽어도 무방하겠다.

머리말
프롤로그: 어느 교실의 오징어게임 풍경

Ⅰ부
착각, 환상 모두가 더 부자가 되자는 꿈

1. 부를 향해 돌진하는 불나방들
 가. 더 부강해지려는 국가들
 나. 중앙정부 예산 따오기 실적 자랑하느라 바쁜 정치인들
 다. 물건을 팔자, 하나라도 더 팔자는 기업들
 라. 학생모집에 매달리는 대학들
 마. 노력하면 성공한다고 믿는 사람들
2. 모두가 함께 더 부자가 될 수 있나?
 가. 내가 더 가지면 남은 덜 가진다.
 나. 어제의 1등과 오늘의 1등은 동일한 가치를 갖는다.
 다. 포지티브섬, 네가티브섬은 가능한가?
3. 부(富)란 무엇인가?
 가. 부의 정의가 빈약한 국부론
 나. 부를 측정하는 기준은 만들 수 있나
 다. 부의 측정기준을 만들어 보자

Ⅱ부

 나. 공간적 제로섬
 다. 시간적 제로섬
 라. 성장의 한계와 제로섬
2. 제로섬 탈출은 가능할까?
 가. 성장과 제로섬 탈출 가능성
 나. 시간을 고려한 제로섬 탈출 가능성
3. 제로섬 법칙의 폐해
 가. 제로섬은 약탈경제를 낳았다.
 나. 제로섬이 가져오는 비효율성

Ⅲ부

자본주의의 태동부터 지금까지, 금융의 세계에 뛰어든 수많은 참여자는 혁신, 실수 그리고 의도하지 않았던 추문을 통해 지금의 월스트리트를 만들었다. 미국의 억만장자 투자자 겸 피셔 인베스트먼트 설립자이자 33년 동안 《포브스》에 칼럼을 연재한 칼럼니스트 켄 피셔는 자신만의 기준에 따라 월스트리트를 만든 100명의 인물을 선발하여 그들의 업적, 사건, 사생활 등을 매력적인 문체로 풀어냈다. 

그가 선정한 100명이 모두 존경할 만한 인물은 아니다. 하지만 경제학자부터 언론인, 사기범, 투기꾼까지 다양한 분야의 인물로 구성된 이들은 어떤 형태로든 현재의 금융 시장에 절대적인 영향을 미쳤고, 우리는 이들의 짧은 전기를 통해 자본주의를 바라보는 올바른 시각을 얻을 수 있다. 

켄 피셔는 자본주의의 역사 속에서 명예 혹은 불명예를 얻은 100명을 조명하며, 이들의 이야기가 현재에 전하는 메시지가 무엇인지 고찰한다. 그것은 과거는 반복된다는 점이고, 과거를 알지 못하는 자는 실패를 반복하게 된다는 것이다.

미 피어슨(Pearson) 사 특유의 내용의 깊이가 상당한 프로그래밍 언어 고급서 시리즈 중 데이텔 앤 어소시에이츠 사의 ‘Python for Programmers’가 오랜만에 번역판으로 나왔다. 특히 이 책은 “파이썬 하면 인공지능 언어”라는 기대를 저버리지 않을 만큼 최신 인공지능과 데이터과학의 이슈를 빠짐없이 망라하여 다양한 실제 사례와 함께 소개한다. 

타 고급 언어에 대한 배경 지식이 있는 프로그래머를 대상으로 하기도 하지만 실습 지침을 사용하여 파이썬(Python)을 첨단 컴퓨팅 기술과 프로그래밍을 알려주는 데 주안점을 둔다. 개별 스니펫에서 40개의 대형 스크립트 및 전체 구현 사례 연구에 이르는 500개 이상의 실제 예제와 관련된 주피터 노트북 코드와 함께 대화형 IPython 인터프리터를 사용하여 최신 파이썬 코딩 관용구를 빠르게 마스터할 수 있다.

반도체는 ‘21세기의 전략물자’, ‘산업의 쌀’이라 불리며 휴대폰, PC, 자동차 등의 생산에 꼭 필요한 현대산업에 없어서는 안 될 중요 자원으로 손꼽힌다. 이미 기업 간의 경쟁을 넘어 국가 대 국가로 번지고 있던 반도체 패권을 향한 각국의 움직임이 2020년, 코로나19로 인해 자동차 반도체 품귀가 발생하며 전 세계적인 차원으로 확산됐다. 

각국은 반도체 산업에 대한 지배력이 국가 안보와 경쟁력과 직결된다는 것을 깨닫고, 공급망이 끊겨 문제가 생기지 않도록 반도체 내수화와 핵심 소재 공급망 다변화, 기업간 M&amp;A를 추진하며 국가적 차원의 공격적인 조치와 투자를 단행하고 있다.

훗날 ‘세계 제1차 반도체 대전’으로 기록될지도 모르는 치열한 반도체 패권 다툼 속에서 우리는 어떻게 대처하고 무엇을 준비해야 할까. 한국경제신문 황정수 기자가 현대산업의 중심 실리콘밸리에서 특파원으로 근무하며 취재한 내용을 바탕으로 집필한 이 책을 통해 우리는 반도체 산업에 대한 정확한 이해와 k-반도체의 나아갈 방향을 예측할 수 있을 것이다.

                    <span>선박투자 이야기
김우석 지음 / 하움출판사 / 2022년 01월 / ISBN:9791164408962
정가: 18,000원 / 판매가: 16,200원 / 마일리지: 69원

제목 그대로 김우석 작가가 지닌 투자에 관련된 모든 이야기를 모아 놓은 집성체와 같다. 선박금융 프로젝트 분석부터 개인적으로 시작했던 여러 가지 투자 방법과 실패담을 가감 없이 담았다. 또한, 선박의 종류와 그것의 특징을 자세하게 담아 투자 시 이점과 주의해야 할 사항을 파악할 수 있도록 했다.

이 책에는 실제로 그 당시 사람들이 어떻게 투자했고 얼마의 이익을 보았으며, 어떤 규모로 손실을 입었는지 설명하는 것에서 끝나지 않는다. 당시에 투자자가 이익을 보거나 손실을 입은 배경을 설명하고, 그때의 상황에서 어떻게 하면 더 큰 이익을 보았을지 혹은 손실을 피할 수 있었을지를 제시한다. 마치 공부를 잘하는 전교 1등의 오답 노트를 얻게 된 것이나 마찬가지다.

저자는 책에서 선택은 항상 본인의 몫이라는 것을 잊지 말라고 강조한다. 또한 의사결정자는 항상 정직하고 본인에게 엄격해야 한다는 것을 언급한다. 투자는 단 한 번의 기회로 커다란 이익을 볼 수 있는 일명 일확천금의 &#x27;로또&#x27;가 아니다. 철저하게 자신을 분석하고 커다란 세계의 경제를 냉철하게 판단해야만 비로소 조금씩 성공을 거둘 수 있다. 그러한 복잡한 시황 속에서 이른바 &#x27;투자 성공기&#x27;를 맞이하기 위해 고군분투한 저자의 스토리에 주목하기를 바란다.

『선형대수와 통계학으로 배우는 머신러닝 with 파이썬』의 장철원 저자가 선형대수 기초를 다잡고 싶은 독자를 위해 집필한 선형대수 책이다. 기초적인 행렬부터 고차원 텐서까지 선형대수를 구성하는 개념 및 이론을 소개하고 독자 스스로 자신의 분야에 응용할 수 있도록 도와준다. 또한, 선형대수 이론이 의미하는 바를 자세히 설명하고 선형대수 이론을 파이썬 코드로 직접 구현함으로써 내 손으로 선형대수 라이브러리를 직접 만드는 즐거움을 선사한다.

실습은 두 파트로 나뉜다. 파이썬 실습 파트에서는 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 순수 파이썬 코드로 선형대수 이론을 직접 구현해 봄으로써 선형대수 기본기를 탄탄하게 다진다. 넘파이 실습 파트에서는 파이썬에서 제공하는 넘파이 라이브러리를 활용해 선형대수 이론을 활용하는 방법을 다룬다.

저자는 ‘어떻게 하면 내 고향 제주를 더 나은 곳, 도민들이 더 행복한 곳으로 만들 수 있을까?’라는 문제의식을 30년 공직생활 내내 마음에 품고 살았다. 퇴임이후 그동안의 경험을 바탕으로 고향 제주도민에 조금이나마 보탬이 되고자 ‘문성유 혼디행복경제연구소’를 열었다.

디지털 시대에 리더는 어떤 역할을 해야 하고 어떤 전략과 실행력을 갖추어야 하는지를 담고 있다. 연세대학교 경영대학 임일 교수와 이무원 교수가 함께 썼다. 지금은 IT가 빠르게 세상을 바꿔 가는 4차 산업혁명 시대이자 디지털 대전환의 시대다. 기업 리더들은 워낙 빨리 발전하고 복잡하게 변화하는 IT 기술을 따라가면서 또 미래 전략까지 짜야 하는 어려움에 부닥쳐 있다. 디지털을 하지 않으면 기업 생존이 위험해질 정도로 혁신의 요구와 변화의 속도는 거세고 빠르고 강하다. 그러다 보니 리더십도 더는 과거의 것을 고집하기가 어려워졌다. 디지털 시대에는 그에 맞는 리더십이 요구되기 때문이다. 이른바 디지털 리더십이다. 리더들의 디지털 리더십 전환이 필요하다. 

그럼 디지털 리더십이란 무엇인가? 기존 리더십과는 무엇이 다른가? 이 책에서는 디지털 리더십이란 현재 그리고 앞으로 어떤 디지털 기술을 어떻게 비즈니스에 활용할지에 대한 통찰력을 바탕으로 비즈니스를 이끌어가는 것이라고 정의한다. 디지털 리더십을 갖추려면 디지털 기술에 대한 이해, 디지털 기술 활용으로 얻을 수 있는 비즈니스 기회를 포착하는 통찰력, 그리고 디지털 기술을 효과적으로 실현하는 실행력 등이 필요하다는 것이다.

우리나라에서 가장 오래된 빵집, 근대 유산이 숨쉬는 힙한 관광지로 유명한 군산에 대해 우리가 미처 몰랐던 모습을 담은 르포르타주. 2017년 7월 현대중공업 군산 조선소 가동 중단, 2018년 5월 한국지엠 군산 공장 운영 중단 이후, 저자는 &#x27;몰락한 도시의 사람들은 어떻게 되었는가?&#x27;라는 질문을 안고 군산으로 향했다. 6주 동안 30여 명의 평범한 사람들을 만나 이야기를 나눴다.

공장이 떠난 뒤 그곳에 남겨진 사람들의 삶이 잔인할 정도로 생생하게 기록되어 있다. 매달 지급되던 180만 원 실업 급여 지급이 마감되는 순간, 재취업을 희망했으나 결국 치킨집을 차릴 수밖에 없었던 현실, 실직한 남편 대신 취업 전선에 뛰어드는 아내들, 비정규직 노동자들이 떠받치던 원룸촌과 상가에 남은 떠돌이 개들, 역사와 문화의 도시에서 기업과 함께 사람들도 빠져나가는 과정 등은 단순히 서쪽 끝 작은 도시에서 일어난 일이라고 치부하기엔 너무나도 현실적이다. 2019년 7월 《한겨레21》 커버 기사 〈공장이 떠난 도시 군산〉을 바탕으로 이후의 변화와 저자의 소회까지 담아 한 권의 책으로 엮었다.


프롤로그: 군산 가는 길

1. 토박이: 유별나고 애틋한 사람들
2. 운명들: 정규직과 비정규직
3. 찬란: 세계 도시를 꿈꾸다
4. 균열: 불안한 여유
5. 그날: 공장이 떠나던 날
6. 이별: 남은 사람 떠난 사람
7. 풍경들: 치킨집과 원룸촌
8. 정체성: 어디서 무엇을 할까
9. 1년: 전환과 머뭇거림
10. 쉬어 가는 이야기: 익숙한 도시에서
11. 다시: 그저 평소 같은 하루

에필로그: 혼란으로 엮인

실제 이론을 코드로 구현하는 데에는 많은 현실적인 격차가 존재하고, 이론을 완벽히 이해한다고 해도 코드로 구현한다는 건 또 다른 문제이다. 그래서 이 책에서는 비지도 학습의 이론을 간단하게 살펴본 후에 알고리즘의 이론과 수식을 여러 단계로 나누고 파이썬 코드로 단계별 결과들을 최대한 상세하게 다루었다.

또한 텐서플로 2의 오토 인코더와 함께 사용하는 주요 딥러닝 이론들을 실습하고 딥러닝의 활성화 함수, 손실 함수, RNN, CNN, LSTM 등을 소개한다. 마지막으로 다양한 예제 데이터와 함께 그동안 배웠던 이론을 적용하고 머신러닝으로 직접 코딩하면서 결과물을 완성할 수 있도록 했다.
