                    <span>We study whether a central bank should deviate from its objective of price stability to promote financial stability. We tackle this question within a textbook New Keynesian model augmented with capital accumulation and microfounded endogenous financial crises. We compare several interest rate rules, under which the central bank responds more or less forcefully to inflation and aggregate output. Our main findings are threefold. First, monetary policy affects the probability of a crisis both in the short run (through aggregate demand) and in the medium run (through savings and capital accumulation). Second, a central bank can both reduce the probability of a crisis and increase welfare by departing from strict inflation targeting and responding systematically to fluctuations in output. Third, financial crises may occur after a long period of unexpectedly loose monetary policy as the central bank abruptly reverses course.</span>

                    <span>Large price changes in industries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have caused erratic fluctuations in the U.S. headline inflation rate. This paper compares alternative approaches to filtering out the transitory effects of these industry price changes and measuring the underlying or core level of inflation over 2020-2021. The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of core, the inflation rate excluding food and energy prices, has performed poorly: over most of 2020-21, it is almost as volatile as headline inflation. Measures of core that exclude a fixed set of additional industries, such as the Atlanta Fed’s sticky-price inflation rate, have been less volatile, but the least volatile have been measures that filter out large price changes in any industry, such as the Cleveland Fed’s median inflation rate and the Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean inflation rate. These core measures have followed smooth paths, drifting down when the economy was weak in 2020 and then rising as the economy has rebounded.</span>

                    <span>We link a new UK management survey covering 8,000 firms to panel data on productivity in manufacturing and services. There is a large variation in management practices, which are highly correlated with productivity, profitability and size. Uniquely, the survey collects firms’ micro forecasts of their own sales and also macro forecasts of GDP. We find that better managed firms make more accurate micro and macro forecasts, even after controlling for their size, age, industry and many other factors. We also show better managed firms appear aware that their forecasts are more accurate, with lower subjective uncertainty around central values. These stylized facts suggest that one reason for the superior performance of better managed firms is that they knowingly make more accurate forecasts, enabling them to make superior operational and strategic choices.</span>

                    <span>We study the optimal allocation of R&amp;D resources in an endogenous growth model with an innovation network, through which one sector’s past innovations may benefit other sectors’ future innovations. First, we provide closed-form sufficient statistics for the optimal path of R&amp;D resource allocation, and we show that planners valuing long-term growth should allocate more R&amp;D toward key sectors that are upstream in the innovation network. Second, we extend to an open-economy setting and illustrate an incentive for countries to free-ride on fundamental technologies: an economy more reliant on foreign knowledge spillovers has less incentive to direct resources toward innovation-upstream sectors, leading to cross-country differences in unilaterally optimal R&amp;D allocations across sectors. Third, we build the global innovation network based on over 30 million global patents and establish its empirical importance for knowledge spillovers. Fourth, we apply the model to evaluate R&amp;D allocations across countries and time. Adopting optimal R&amp;D allocations can generate substantial welfare improvements across the globe. For the United States, R&amp;D misallocation accounts for about 0.68 percentage points of missing annual growth since the 2000s.</span>

                    <span>Countries and cities around the world increasingly rely on centralized systems to assign students to schools. Two algorithms, deferred acceptance (DA) and immediate acceptance (IA), are widespread. The latter is often criticized for harming disadvantaged families who fail to get access to popular schools. This paper investigates the effect of the national ban of the IA mechanism in England in 2008. Before the ban, 49 English local authorities used DA and 16 used IA. All IA local authorities switched to DA afterwards, giving rise to a cross-market difference-in-differences research design. Our results show that the elimination of IA reduces measures of school quality for low-SES students more than high-SES students. After the ban, low-SES students attend schools with lower value-added and more disadvantaged and low-achieving peers. This effect is primarily driven by a decrease in low-SES admissions at selective schools. Our findings point to an unintended consequence of the IA to DA transition: by encouraging high-SES parents to report their preferences truthfully, DA increases competition for top schools, which crowds out low-SES students.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies differences in receipt and take-up of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits among white and Black individuals. We combine state-level UI regulations with data containing detailed information on individuals’ work history and UI receipt. Black individuals who separate from a job are 24% less likely to receive UI than whites. The UI receipt gap stems primarily from lower take-up of UI benefits among likely eligible individuals, as opposed to differences in benefit eligibility. Statistical decompositions indicate that about one-half of the take-up gap is explained by Black workers’ lower pre-unemployment earnings and higher tendency to live in the South.</span>

                    <span>We investigate behavioral responses to a staggered disruption in the supply of prescription opioids across U.S. states: the introduction of electronic Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). Using administrative datasets, we find PDMPs curtail the proliferation of prescription opioids. Physicians respond to monitoring on the extensive margin, limiting the number of patients to whom they prescribe opioids without adjusting dosage or duration. This decreases supply to long-term opioid users, who evade the restrictions by acquiring prescriptions from out-of-state prescribers and by substituting to heroin. This causes a surge in heroin overdoses, which offsets reductions in hospitalizations and deaths from prescription opioids.</span>

                    <span>This paper employs administrative data from one of the largest plan providers in France to investigate the role of plan and default characteristics in affecting whether employees participate in the plan and whether they accept its default investment option. The dataset includes information on the saving choices of 680,392 active employees at 1,610 firms. French employers have wide discretion in structuring employee saving plans.  All plans must offer medium-term investments, which cannot be accessed for five years.  Employers may also offer long-term investments that cannot be accessed until retirement.  When plans include a long-term option, participation is lower than when the plan offers only more liquid medium term investments.  The presence of a long-term saving option also reduces the take-up of the plan’s default investment allocation, which must include a long-term component.  One interpretation of the findings, consistent with the theory of choice overload, is that some employees are unwilling to forego the liquidity of the medium-term option but find it costly to make an active election when they opt out of the default, and therefore choose not to participate in the plan at all.</span>

                    <span>We trace the linkages between the episodes of fiscal expansion and consolidation in 72 advanced and emerging and developing economies. The findings suggest that fiscal expansions are positively associated with economic growth, which in turn is positively linked with better sustainable development outcomes. The association between fiscal consolidation and growth as well as the sustainable development indicators, however, is not clear-cut. Jointly, more tax revenues and expenditures, together with better governance help explain the association between economic growth and inclusive development. High-income, high-tax-revenue, and manufacture-exporting economies have made significant progress on reducing disease-linked mortality and improving environment protection along with economic growth. Meanwhile, emerging and developing, low-tax-revenue, and commodity-exporting economies have gained notable improvement in poverty reduction, pre-primary enrolment and access to basic sanitation services and clean cooking fuels and technologies, and lowering bribery incidence. On average, the sampled economies have persistently achieved better primary goals such as sanitation, clean fuels and technologies. Achievements in mortality reduction, and environmental protection goals are shown more recently.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor activity using real-time data from millions of GitHub users around the world. We show that the pandemic triggered a sharp pattern of labor reallocation at both the global and regional level. Users were more likely to work on weekends and outside of traditional 9 am to 6 pm hours, especially during the early phase of the pandemic. We also document considerable heterogeneity between different user groups and locations. Some locations show a steady reversion back to historical work patterns, while others have experienced persistent trend deviations in the wake of COVID-19. The pattern of labor reallocation is slightly more pronounced among males in our sample, suggesting that men may have benefited more from the increased flexibility provided by remote work than women. Finally, we show that the pattern of reallocation was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in overall activity, though this effect is more transient. We discuss several potential mechanisms and draw tentative conclusions for broader workplace trends given our study population.</span>

We observe a sharp spike in poverty, peaking during India&#x27;s sharp but short lockdown.  However, there was a striking decrease in income inequality outside the lockdown.  There was a smaller decrease in consumption inequality, likely due to consumption smoothing.  Evidence supports two mechanisms for the decline in income inequality: the capital income of top-quartile earners covaries more with aggregate income, and demand for labor fell more for higher quartiles.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a “second pandemic” of anxiety and depression. While vaccines are primarily aimed at reducing COVID-19 transmission and mortality risks, they may have important secondary benefits. We use data from U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey merged to state-level COVID-19 vaccination eligibility data to estimate the secondary benefits of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health outcomes. To address endogenous COVID-19 vaccination, we leverage state-level variation in the timing of when age groups are eligible for vaccination. We estimate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces anxiety and depression symptoms by nearly 30%. Nearly all the benefits are private benefits, and we find little evidence of spillover effects, that is, increases in community vaccination rates are not associated with improved anxiety or depression symptoms among the unvaccinated. We find that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with larger reductions in anxiety or depression symptoms among individuals with lower education levels, who rent their housing, who are not able to telework, and who have children in their household. The economic benefit of reductions in anxiety and depression are approximately $350 billion. Our results highlight an important, but understudied, secondary benefit of COVID-19 vaccinations.</span>

                    <span>We examine the impact of conflict-driven displacement on human capital. We focus on the Mozambican civil war (1977–1992), during which more than four million civilians fled to the countryside, cities, and refugee camps and settlements in neighboring countries. We leverage the full post-war census to compare siblings separated during the war, using those who stayed behind as a counterfactual to one’s displacement path. Uprooted children register higher investments in education. Second, we quantify the relative importance of place-based and displacement effects. The latter increases education and decreases attachment to agriculture by the same rate as being exposed to an environment approximately one standard deviation more developed than one’s birthplace. Third, we conduct a survey in Nampula, whose population doubled during the civil war. Those who fled to the city have significantly higher education than their siblings who remained in the countryside and they converged to the levels of schooling of non-mover urban-born individuals. However, those displaced exhibit significantly lower social/civic capital and have worse mental health, even three decades after the war. These findings reveal that displacement shocks can trigger human capital investments, breaking links with subsistence agriculture, but at the cost of long-lasting, social, and psychological traumas.</span>

Social and organizational skills are general in that they are sought by employers of almost all college majors, whereas other skills are more specialized. In turn, general majors––Business and General Engineering––have skill profiles similar to all majors; Nursing and Education are specialized. These cross-major differences in skill profiles explain considerable wage variation, with little role for within-major differences in skills across areas.

                    <span>We build a model with heterogeneous firms and banks to analyze how policy affects credit allocation and long-term economic outcomes. When firms are hit by small negative shocks, conventional monetary policy can restore efficient bank lending and production by lowering interest rates. Large shocks, however, necessitate unconventional policy such as regulatory forbearance towards banks to stabilize the economy. Aggressive accommodation runs the risk of introducing zombie lending and a “diabolical sorting”, whereby low-capitalization banks extend new credit or evergreen existing loans to low-productivity firms. If shocks reduce the profitability gap between healthy and zombie firms, the optimal forbearance policy is non-monotone in the size of the shock. In a dynamic setting, policy aimed at avoiding short-term recessions can be trapped into protracted low rates and excessive forbearance, due to congestion externalities imposed by zombie lending on healthier firms. The resulting economic sclerosis delays the recovery from transitory shocks, and can even lead to permanent output losses.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we characterize the set of equilibria in a generalized version of the canonical two-region economic geography model that nests the class of models in Allen and Arkolakis (2014) as well as Krugman (1991). We show that the set of (regular) equilibria corresponds to the set of zeros of a function V(x), where x is the relative price of manufacturing goods produced in the two regions (adjusted by the trade elasticity). Using this approach, we provide sufficient conditions for uniqueness of equilibria that — in contrast to the well-know result in Allen and Arkolakis (2014) — allow for positive agglomeration externalities even in the absence of congestion effects, and highlight the key role played by three additional parameters: the trade elasticity, which regulates the strength of the dispersion force associated with the decline in the terms of trade caused by migration into a region; trade costs, which weaken this dispersion force by limiting trade across regions; and the importance of the agricultural sector, which pushes against agglomeration forces in manufacturing. We also discuss how asymmetries between the two regions tend to push against multiplicity.</span>

                    <span>We study empirical patterns in investment behavior using a comprehensive data set of defined contribution plans. Using plan-level portfolio allocation data for the near universe of 401(k) plans over the period 2009-2019, we document substantial differences in investment behavior across plans. Plans with wealthier and more educated participants tend to have higher equity exposure while plans with more retirees and minorities tend to have lower equity exposure. These patterns cannot be explained by differences in 401(k) menus or participation costs. To help interpret these facts, we use a revealed preference approach to estimate investors&#x27; expectations of stock market returns and risk aversion, where we allow investors to have heterogeneous risk aversion and subjective and potentially biased beliefs. We find that there is substantial variation in both beliefs and risk aversion across investors and over time, and that both sources of variation help explain investors&#x27; portfolio decisions. We also provide new evidence to understand how investors form beliefs. We find that investors extrapolate beliefs from past fund returns even when they initially allocate portfolios in new plans. We also find that investors extrapolate beliefs about the market from the past performance of their employer, which suggests that investor experience helps shape beliefs.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a tractable model of a global economy in which countries can use a broad range of policy instruments---the nominal interest rate, taxes on imports and exports, taxes on capital flows or foreign exchange interventions. Low demand may lead to unemployment because of downward nominal wage stickiness. Markov perfect equilibria with and without international cooperation are characterized in closed form. The welfare costs of trade and currency wars crucially depend on the state of global demand and on the policy instruments that are used by national policymakers. Countries have more incentives to deviate from free trade when global demand is low. Trade wars lower employment if they involve tariffs on imports but raise employment if they involve export subsidies. Tariff wars can lead to self-fulfilling global liquidity traps.</span>

                    <span>A few key points:
1) There is a clear seasonal pattern for house prices.
2) The surge in distressed sales during the housing bust distorted the seasonal pattern.
3) Even though distressed sales are down significantly, the seasonal factor is based on several years of data - and the factor is now closer to normal (second graph below).
4) Still the seasonal index is probably a better indicator of actual price movements than the Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) index.
For in depth description of these issues, see Jed Kolko&#x27;s article from 2014 (currently Chief Economist at Indeed) &quot;Let’s Improve, Not Ignore, Seasonal Adjustment of Housing Data&quot;
Note: I was one of several people to question the change in the seasonal factor (here is a post in 2009) - and this led to S&amp;P Case-Shiller questioning the seasonal factor too (from April 2010).  I still use the seasonal factor (I think it is better than using the NSA data).

This graph shows the month-to-month change in the NSA Case-Shiller National index since 1987 (through October 2021). The seasonal pattern was smaller back in the &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s and increased once the bubble burst. 
The seasonal swings declined following the bubble, however the recent price surge changed the month-over-month pattern.
The second graph shows the seasonal factors for the Case-Shiller National index since 1987.  The factors started to change near the peak of the bubble, and really increased during the bust.   
The swings in the seasonal factors have decreased, and the seasonal factors has been moving back towards more normal levels.

Note that the recent price surge hasn&#x27;t distorted the seasonal factors.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the CalculatedRisk Real Estate Newsletter: Case-Shiller National Index up 19.1% Year-over-year in October
Excerpt: 
Both the Case-Shiller House Price Index (HPI) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) HPI for October were released today. Here is a graph of the month-over-month (MoM) change in the Case-Shiller National Index Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
The MoM increase in Case-Shiller was at 1.03%; still historically high, but lower than the previous 14 months. House prices started increasing sharply in the Case-Shiller index in August 2020, so the last 15 months have all been historically very strong, but the peak MoM growth is behind us - and the year-over-price growth is starting to decelerate.
...

We are seeing the expected deceleration in house price growth, and this trend will probably continue for at least a few more months (more on this tomorrow).  My sense is the Case-Shiller National annual growth rate of 19.99% in August was probably the peak YoY growth rate, however, since the normal level of inventory is probably in the 4 to 6 months range - we’d have to see a significant increase in inventory to sharply slow price increases, and that is why I’m focused on inventory!

Excerpt: 
This update adds Charlotte, Columbus, Miami, New York, and Phoenix.
  ...
  Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 13.5% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 28.5% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 25.5% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market and suggests we will see new record low inventory levels this Winter.

Inventory usually declines sharply over the holidays - so we will likely see new record lows next week.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of December 24th, inventory was at 310 thousand (7-day average), compared to 437 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 29.0%.  Inventory is down 4.8% from last week.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 60.3% from 783 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 326 thousand, and was down 28.2% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory last week was about 1.3% above the record low set-in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September, when inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 29.0% from the peak for the year.

넷플릭스를 통해 세상을 강타한 ‘오징어 게임’은 사실 ‘제로섬 게임’이다. 내가 이기면 네가 지고 네가 이기면 내가 지는 그런 게임 말이다. 제로섬 게임은 두 개인, 두 기업 등 두 주체 간의 이기고 지는 게임이기도 하지만, 이기는 주체도 지는 주체도 여럿인 게임이기도 하다. 그래서 제로섬 게임에서는 주체들이 얻은 이익을 순서대로 줄을 세워 석차로 나타낼 수 있다. 이익의 양이 아니라 석차만이 의미가 있다.

  From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 and DOW futures are up slightly (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $73.79 per barrel and Brent at $76.14 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $48, and Brent was at $51 - so WTI oil prices are up 50% year-over-year. 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.25 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.24 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.01 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Question #10 for 2022: Will inventory increase as the pandemic subsides, or will inventory decrease further in 2022?
Brief excerpt: 
Earlier I posted some questions on my blog for next year: Ten Economic Questions for 2022.   Some of these questions concern real estate (inventory, house prices, housing credit, housing starts, new home sales), and I’ll post those in the newsletter (others like GDP and employment will be on my blog).
I&#x27;m adding some thoughts, and maybe some predictions for each question. 
...
And the sharp decline in inventory during the pandemic (green arrow) was an indicator that price appreciation would increase. Inventory declined due to a combination of potential sellers keeping their properties off the market during a pandemic, and a pickup in buying due to record low mortgage rates, a move away from multi-family rentals and strong second home buying (to escape the high-density cities). And at the same time, demographics were favorable for home buying (a large cohort has moved into the peak home buying years).
...
First, it appears we will see record low inventories over the next few months. This suggests we will see further strong price gains over the next several months (with low inventories).
In 2021, the NAR showed inventory bottomed in January and (inventory bottoms in December), however the local MLS data, and the Altos Research data, showed inventory bottomed even later than usual - in March or early April 2021.  If 2022 follows the normal seasonal pattern, we will see inventory increasing by February (and maybe even in January).
The timing of the seasonal bottom will be important this year.  If inventory bottoms seasonally in December, we might see inventory increase YoY later in 2022.  However, if inventory doesn&#x27;t bottom until March or April, we will probably see another crazy year with little inventory.

Brief excerpt: 
“In a report last month, I wrote about how data from Redfin and CoreLogic indicated that there had been a surge in investor buying of SF homes in the second and third quarters of this year, with some of the biggest increases coming from “large” investors.
One private company that has massively increased its holdings of SF residential properties is Pretium Partners, a “specialized investment manager” with a huge portfolio of SF residential properties for rent. (Pretium owns Progress Residential, which has recently gotten some negative press.)
According to Pretium’s website, Pretium has increased the number of SF properties it owns from 41,000 at the end of 2020 to 70,700 at the end of September 2021.

Below are my ten questions for 2022.  These are just questions; I&#x27;ll follow up with some thoughts on each of these questions.
The purpose of these questions is to provide a framework to think about how the U.S. economy will perform in 2022, and if there are surprises - like in 2020 - to adjust my thinking.

A key question is when will the pandemic subside significantly?  This will have a huge economic impact but is a question for infectious disease experts.   The good news is a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, and there are effective drugs on the way.  Science should continue to make progress against the virus.

• The national delinquency rate saw yet another month of steady improvement, with November’s 4.1% monthly decline matching the 18-month average rate of reduction
  
• Despite serious delinquencies (loans 90+ days past due but not in foreclosure) falling another 80,000 from October, over 1 million such delinquencies remain, 2.5 times more than at the start of the pandemic

자본주의의 태동부터 지금까지, 금융의 세계에 뛰어든 수많은 참여자는 혁신, 실수 그리고 의도하지 않았던 추문을 통해 지금의 월스트리트를 만들었다. 미국의 억만장자 투자자 겸 피셔 인베스트먼트 설립자이자 33년 동안 《포브스》에 칼럼을 연재한 칼럼니스트 켄 피셔는 자신만의 기준에 따라 월스트리트를 만든 100명의 인물을 선발하여 그들의 업적, 사건, 사생활 등을 매력적인 문체로 풀어냈다. 

그가 선정한 100명이 모두 존경할 만한 인물은 아니다. 하지만 경제학자부터 언론인, 사기범, 투기꾼까지 다양한 분야의 인물로 구성된 이들은 어떤 형태로든 현재의 금융 시장에 절대적인 영향을 미쳤고, 우리는 이들의 짧은 전기를 통해 자본주의를 바라보는 올바른 시각을 얻을 수 있다. 

켄 피셔는 자본주의의 역사 속에서 명예 혹은 불명예를 얻은 100명을 조명하며, 이들의 이야기가 현재에 전하는 메시지가 무엇인지 고찰한다. 그것은 과거는 반복된다는 점이고, 과거를 알지 못하는 자는 실패를 반복하게 된다는 것이다.

                    <span>According to the OECD, social mobility in Germany is lower than in most other developed economies, reigniting a debate on equality of opportunity and shortcomings of the education system. This column discusses how census data can be used to obtain high quality mobility statistics for Germany. Using the Abitur educational qualification as a measure of opportunity, it suggests that relative mobility has remained constant for recent birth cohorts but points to substantial geographic variation in mobility measures across regions in the country.</span>

                    <span>Global warming is expected to dramatically reduce agricultural productivity in hotter parts of the world. This column considers ways to accommodate that change. Hot, poor countries would benefit by shifting away from agriculture into less vulnerable, non-agricultural sectors as temperatures rise, but such a reallocation of resources is unlikely without a major increase in global trade integration. As long as poor countries import little of their food, they are likely to continue specialising in agriculture to meet domestic subsistence needs, even as their farms become increasingly vulnerable to climate change.</span>

                    <span>Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in November was 1.24%, down from 1.32% in October.  Freddie&#x27;s rate is down year-over-year from 2.75% in November 2020.
Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but are not reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.09%, down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.</span>

From CoStar: STR: US Hotels Surpass Performance Levels Seen in Comparable Week in 2019
U.S. hotel performance surpassed the levels seen during the comparable week of 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through December 18.
December 12-18, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 53.8% (+7.7%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$121.87 (+11.6%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$65.61 (+20.2%)
Percentage changes were in part lifted by the comparable week of 2019 (ending 21 December) being closer to Christmas.
  
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Although down compared to 2019, the 4-week average of the occupancy rate is now above the median rate for the previous 20 years (Blue).


Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The 4-week average of the occupancy rate will bottom seasonally over the next few weeks.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: New Home Sales: Record 110 thousand homes have not been started
Brief excerpt: 
Sales, year to date in 2021, are 6.5% below sales in 2020, and new home sales in 2021 will finish solidly below sales in 2020 - since sales in 2020 finished strong.
This graph shows new home sales for 2020 and 2021 by month (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
The year-over-year comparisons were easy in the first half of 2021 - especially in March and April. However, sales will be down year-over-year again in December - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
...
The next graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction. “Months of supply” is inventory at each stage, divided by the sales rate.
The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 39 thousand in November, up from the record low of 33 thousand in March, April, May and July 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (red line). This is about half the normal level.
The inventory of new homes under construction is at 4.1 months (blue line) - well above the normal level. This elevated level of homes under construction is due to supply chain constraints.
And a record 110 thousand homes have not been started - about 1.8 months of supply (grey line) - almost double the normal level. Homebuilders are probably waiting to start some homes until they have a firmer grasp on prices.

                    <span>The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in November were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 744 thousand.
The previous three months were revised down significantly. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in November 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 744,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 12.4 percent above the revised October rate of 662,000, but is 14.0 percent below the November 2020 estimate of 865,000.

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.
New home sales are now declining year-over-year since sales soared following the first few months of the pandemic.
The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply.
The months of supply decreased in November to 6.5 months from 7.1 months in October. 
The all-time record high was 12.1 months of supply in January 2009.  The all-time record low was 3.5 months, most recently in October 2020.
This is above the normal range (about 4 to 6 months of supply is normal).
&quot;The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 402,000.  This represents a supply of 6.5 months at the current sales rate.&quot;
The last graph shows sales NSA (monthly sales, not seasonally adjusted annual rate).
In November 2021 (red column), 53 thousand new homes were sold (NSA).  Last year, 61 thousand homes were sold in November.
The all-time high for November was 86 thousand in 2005, and the all-time low for November was 20 thousand in 2010.
This was below expectations of 766 thousand SAAR, and sales in the three previous months were revised down significantly.  I&#x27;ll have more later today.</span>

Personal income increased $90.4 billion (0.4 percent) in November according to estimates released today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Disposable personal income (DPI) increased $70.4 billion (0.4 percent) and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $104.7 billion (0.6 percent).
Real DPI decreased 0.2 percent in November and Real PCE increased less than 0.1 percent; spending on services increased 0.5 percent and spending on goods decreased 0.8 percent. The PCE price index increased 0.6 percent. Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index increased 0.5 percent
 emphasis added
The November PCE price index increased 5.7 percent year-over-year and the November PCE price index, excluding food and energy, increased 4.7 percent year-over-year.

The dashed red lines are the quarterly levels for real PCE.
Personal income was above expectations, and the increase in PCE was below expectations.
Using the two-month method to estimate Q4 PCE growth, PCE was increasing at a 5.7% annual rate in Q4 2021. (Using the mid-month method, PCE was increasing at 4.2%).</span>

미 피어슨(Pearson) 사 특유의 내용의 깊이가 상당한 프로그래밍 언어 고급서 시리즈 중 데이텔 앤 어소시에이츠 사의 ‘Python for Programmers’가 오랜만에 번역판으로 나왔다. 특히 이 책은 “파이썬 하면 인공지능 언어”라는 기대를 저버리지 않을 만큼 최신 인공지능과 데이터과학의 이슈를 빠짐없이 망라하여 다양한 실제 사례와 함께 소개한다. 

타 고급 언어에 대한 배경 지식이 있는 프로그래머를 대상으로 하기도 하지만 실습 지침을 사용하여 파이썬(Python)을 첨단 컴퓨팅 기술과 프로그래밍을 알려주는 데 주안점을 둔다. 개별 스니펫에서 40개의 대형 스크립트 및 전체 구현 사례 연구에 이르는 500개 이상의 실제 예제와 관련된 주피터 노트북 코드와 함께 대화형 IPython 인터프리터를 사용하여 최신 파이썬 코딩 관용구를 빠르게 마스터할 수 있다.

                    <span>Inflation has recently surged in both the US and the EU. This column uses responses from surveys of a representative sample of the US population as well as academic economists and US firm managers to show that households and managers are more likely than experts to think that the current surge in inflation will be persistent. Since the narratives individuals use to explain movements in inflation appear central to whether inflation expectations remain anchored, communication strategies by policymakers could put emphasis on specific narratives that highlight that inflationary pressures are unlikely to persist.</span>

                    <span>Rising dispersion in productivity across firms has focused attention on the drivers of superior performances of a minority of firms at the ‘productivity frontier’ and disappointing performances of the remaining ‘productivity laggards’. This column brings together data from ten countries to explore how differences in productivity outcomes of frontier and laggard firms depend on the composition, diversity, and competencies of their managers and their workers. Overall, this ‘human side’ explains about a third of the observed differences in productivity across firms, more than is accounted for by differences in capital intensity.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented fiscal stimulus by many governments to counter the economic recession. This column uses high-frequency data on government spending, lockdown restrictions, and economic indicators in the US to assess the effectiveness of fiscal policy. It shows that government spending increased employment, but only in cities not subject to strict stay-at-home restrictions. It also shows that consumer spending shifted strongly toward durable goods during the pandemic. Well-targeted fiscal measures will be crucial in the case of another recessionary outbreak, especially transfers to firms on the brink of exit.</span>

This graph shows actual sales from the BEA (Blue), and Wards forecast for December (Red).
The Wards forecast of 12.7 million SAAR, would be down about 1% from last month, and down 22% from a year ago (sales were solid in December 2020, as sales recovered from the depths of the pandemic, and weren&#x27;t yet impacted by supply chain issues).</span>

A few highlights: 
• Total mortgage originations are expected to decrease to $2.61T in 2022, as more of the activity shifts to the purchase market.
      - Refinance originations are expected to drop to $870B.
      - Purchase originations are forecast to eclipse 2021’s record high and reach $1.74T, backed by strong housing demand and rising home prices and sales.
• Home-price growth is forecast to moderate to 5.1%.
• Mortgage rates are expected to rise throughout the year and reach 4.0% by December 2022. 
• Economic growth is forecast to be at 4.0% in 2022, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% by the end of the year.</span>

Excerpt: 
This graph shows existing home sales by month for 2020 and 2021.
This was the fourth consecutive month with sales down year-over-year. Sales will likely be down YoY in December and probably in January 2022 too since were exceptionally strong last Winter.
...
[and on inventory] Months-of-supply at 2.1 months is very low, but still above the record low of 1.9 months set in December 2020 and January 2021.  That record will be tested next month.
We will probably see inventory at a new record low over the Winter. Inventory is currently at 1.11 million (according to the NAR), and the record low was 1.03 million in January and February of 2021.

반도체는 ‘21세기의 전략물자’, ‘산업의 쌀’이라 불리며 휴대폰, PC, 자동차 등의 생산에 꼭 필요한 현대산업에 없어서는 안 될 중요 자원으로 손꼽힌다. 이미 기업 간의 경쟁을 넘어 국가 대 국가로 번지고 있던 반도체 패권을 향한 각국의 움직임이 2020년, 코로나19로 인해 자동차 반도체 품귀가 발생하며 전 세계적인 차원으로 확산됐다. 

각국은 반도체 산업에 대한 지배력이 국가 안보와 경쟁력과 직결된다는 것을 깨닫고, 공급망이 끊겨 문제가 생기지 않도록 반도체 내수화와 핵심 소재 공급망 다변화, 기업간 M&amp;A를 추진하며 국가적 차원의 공격적인 조치와 투자를 단행하고 있다.

훗날 ‘세계 제1차 반도체 대전’으로 기록될지도 모르는 치열한 반도체 패권 다툼 속에서 우리는 어떻게 대처하고 무엇을 준비해야 할까. 한국경제신문 황정수 기자가 현대산업의 중심 실리콘밸리에서 특파원으로 근무하며 취재한 내용을 바탕으로 집필한 이 책을 통해 우리는 반도체 산업에 대한 정확한 이해와 k-반도체의 나아갈 방향을 예측할 수 있을 것이다.

                    <span>선박투자 이야기
김우석 지음 / 하움출판사 / 2022년 01월 / ISBN:9791164408962
정가: 18,000원 / 판매가: 16,200원 / 마일리지: 900원

제목 그대로 김우석 작가가 지닌 투자에 관련된 모든 이야기를 모아 놓은 집성체와 같다. 선박금융 프로젝트 분석부터 개인적으로 시작했던 여러 가지 투자 방법과 실패담을 가감 없이 담았다. 또한, 선박의 종류와 그것의 특징을 자세하게 담아 투자 시 이점과 주의해야 할 사항을 파악할 수 있도록 했다.

이 책에는 실제로 그 당시 사람들이 어떻게 투자했고 얼마의 이익을 보았으며, 어떤 규모로 손실을 입었는지 설명하는 것에서 끝나지 않는다. 당시에 투자자가 이익을 보거나 손실을 입은 배경을 설명하고, 그때의 상황에서 어떻게 하면 더 큰 이익을 보았을지 혹은 손실을 피할 수 있었을지를 제시한다. 마치 공부를 잘하는 전교 1등의 오답 노트를 얻게 된 것이나 마찬가지다.

저자는 책에서 선택은 항상 본인의 몫이라는 것을 잊지 말라고 강조한다. 또한 의사결정자는 항상 정직하고 본인에게 엄격해야 한다는 것을 언급한다. 투자는 단 한 번의 기회로 커다란 이익을 볼 수 있는 일명 일확천금의 &#x27;로또&#x27;가 아니다. 철저하게 자신을 분석하고 커다란 세계의 경제를 냉철하게 판단해야만 비로소 조금씩 성공을 거둘 수 있다. 그러한 복잡한 시황 속에서 이른바 &#x27;투자 성공기&#x27;를 맞이하기 위해 고군분투한 저자의 스토리에 주목하기를 바란다.

『선형대수와 통계학으로 배우는 머신러닝 with 파이썬』의 장철원 저자가 선형대수 기초를 다잡고 싶은 독자를 위해 집필한 선형대수 책이다. 기초적인 행렬부터 고차원 텐서까지 선형대수를 구성하는 개념 및 이론을 소개하고 독자 스스로 자신의 분야에 응용할 수 있도록 도와준다. 또한, 선형대수 이론이 의미하는 바를 자세히 설명하고 선형대수 이론을 파이썬 코드로 직접 구현함으로써 내 손으로 선형대수 라이브러리를 직접 만드는 즐거움을 선사한다.

실습은 두 파트로 나뉜다. 파이썬 실습 파트에서는 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 순수 파이썬 코드로 선형대수 이론을 직접 구현해 봄으로써 선형대수 기본기를 탄탄하게 다진다. 넘파이 실습 파트에서는 파이썬에서 제공하는 넘파이 라이브러리를 활용해 선형대수 이론을 활용하는 방법을 다룬다.

                    <span>The Federal Reserve has recently changed monetary stance and signalled a faster than anticipated pace of monetary tightening, while the ECB is more dovish. This column applies a statistical model to recent data on oil prices, inflation, expectations, labour markets and output, and finds that the model’s forecasts support the difference in stance of the two central banks. Based on an assessment of cyclical inflation being mostly driven by transitory energy price disturbances and a very small Phillips curve contribution in both jurisdictions, it predicts that in a year from now euro area HICP inflation will still be below the 2% target, at 1.75%, while in the US CPI inflation will be above, at 2.75%.</span>

                    <span>Carbon pricing is increasingly used by governments to reduce emissions. Using data from 21 European countries, this column considers how education quality interacts with the effect of carbon pricing on emissions, output, and wage inequality. Cognitive skills are associated with lower emissions per output and faster reductions in emissions per output across time. The association is primarily with the cognitive skills of professional and managerial occupations, which would be most involved in innovation and adoption.</span>

                    <span>What are central banks held accountable for by elected officials? This column employs structural topic models on a new dataset of the Monetary Dialogues between the Members of the European Parliament and the President of the ECB to reveal differences in how MEPs keep the ECB accountable for its primary objective of price stability. It also shows that unemployment is a key explanatory variable for the political voice articulated by individual MEPs in accountability settings. These findings reveal the existence of a ‘political’ Phillips curve reaction function.</span>

디지털 시대에 리더는 어떤 역할을 해야 하고 어떤 전략과 실행력을 갖추어야 하는지를 담고 있다. 연세대학교 경영대학 임일 교수와 이무원 교수가 함께 썼다. 지금은 IT가 빠르게 세상을 바꿔 가는 4차 산업혁명 시대이자 디지털 대전환의 시대다. 기업 리더들은 워낙 빨리 발전하고 복잡하게 변화하는 IT 기술을 따라가면서 또 미래 전략까지 짜야 하는 어려움에 부닥쳐 있다. 디지털을 하지 않으면 기업 생존이 위험해질 정도로 혁신의 요구와 변화의 속도는 거세고 빠르고 강하다. 그러다 보니 리더십도 더는 과거의 것을 고집하기가 어려워졌다. 디지털 시대에는 그에 맞는 리더십이 요구되기 때문이다. 이른바 디지털 리더십이다. 리더들의 디지털 리더십 전환이 필요하다. 

그럼 디지털 리더십이란 무엇인가? 기존 리더십과는 무엇이 다른가? 이 책에서는 디지털 리더십이란 현재 그리고 앞으로 어떤 디지털 기술을 어떻게 비즈니스에 활용할지에 대한 통찰력을 바탕으로 비즈니스를 이끌어가는 것이라고 정의한다. 디지털 리더십을 갖추려면 디지털 기술에 대한 이해, 디지털 기술 활용으로 얻을 수 있는 비즈니스 기회를 포착하는 통찰력, 그리고 디지털 기술을 효과적으로 실현하는 실행력 등이 필요하다는 것이다.

우리나라에서 가장 오래된 빵집, 근대 유산이 숨쉬는 힙한 관광지로 유명한 군산에 대해 우리가 미처 몰랐던 모습을 담은 르포르타주. 2017년 7월 현대중공업 군산 조선소 가동 중단, 2018년 5월 한국지엠 군산 공장 운영 중단 이후, 저자는 &#x27;몰락한 도시의 사람들은 어떻게 되었는가?&#x27;라는 질문을 안고 군산으로 향했다. 6주 동안 30여 명의 평범한 사람들을 만나 이야기를 나눴다.

공장이 떠난 뒤 그곳에 남겨진 사람들의 삶이 잔인할 정도로 생생하게 기록되어 있다. 매달 지급되던 180만 원 실업 급여 지급이 마감되는 순간, 재취업을 희망했으나 결국 치킨집을 차릴 수밖에 없었던 현실, 실직한 남편 대신 취업 전선에 뛰어드는 아내들, 비정규직 노동자들이 떠받치던 원룸촌과 상가에 남은 떠돌이 개들, 역사와 문화의 도시에서 기업과 함께 사람들도 빠져나가는 과정 등은 단순히 서쪽 끝 작은 도시에서 일어난 일이라고 치부하기엔 너무나도 현실적이다. 2019년 7월 《한겨레21》 커버 기사 〈공장이 떠난 도시 군산〉을 바탕으로 이후의 변화와 저자의 소회까지 담아 한 권의 책으로 엮었다.


프롤로그: 군산 가는 길

1. 토박이: 유별나고 애틋한 사람들
2. 운명들: 정규직과 비정규직
3. 찬란: 세계 도시를 꿈꾸다
4. 균열: 불안한 여유
5. 그날: 공장이 떠나던 날
6. 이별: 남은 사람 떠난 사람
7. 풍경들: 치킨집과 원룸촌
8. 정체성: 어디서 무엇을 할까
9. 1년: 전환과 머뭇거림
10. 쉬어 가는 이야기: 익숙한 도시에서
11. 다시: 그저 평소 같은 하루

에필로그: 혼란으로 엮인

실제 이론을 코드로 구현하는 데에는 많은 현실적인 격차가 존재하고, 이론을 완벽히 이해한다고 해도 코드로 구현한다는 건 또 다른 문제이다. 그래서 이 책에서는 비지도 학습의 이론을 간단하게 살펴본 후에 알고리즘의 이론과 수식을 여러 단계로 나누고 파이썬 코드로 단계별 결과들을 최대한 상세하게 다루었다.

또한 텐서플로 2의 오토 인코더와 함께 사용하는 주요 딥러닝 이론들을 실습하고 딥러닝의 활성화 함수, 손실 함수, RNN, CNN, LSTM 등을 소개한다. 마지막으로 다양한 예제 데이터와 함께 그동안 배웠던 이론을 적용하고 머신러닝으로 직접 코딩하면서 결과물을 완성할 수 있도록 했다.

필요한 자금을 계산해보자
자연스럽게 저축하는 몸을 만들자
많은 돈을 모을 수 있는 골든타임
돈을 모으는 목적은 주택 구입이 아니다
돈을 모으는 동안 공부를 해야 한다
도박과 투자의 차이점은 불확실함의 정도
떠올려보자! 누구에게나 투자 성공 경험이 있다
적립식 펀드로 재밌게 실용적인 공부를 하라
분산투자는 나중에, 지금은 집중하자

4장 MZ세대가 부동산에 투자하는 법
많은 투자 상품 중 무엇부터 공부해야 할까?
소액 아파트 투자, 이렇게 성공했다
부동산 규제 정책이 실패한 이유
주택 공급량에 구매 타이밍이 있다

안전한 주식 투자를 위한 기본 지식
시가총액 상위 종목의 특징
개별 종목 투자가 어려운 이유
시장에 투자하면 실패하지 않는다
안전하고 유망한 시장은 정해져 있다

기본소득은 과연 가능할까. 인공지능과 로봇이 인간의 노동력을 대체할 미래에는 기본소득으로 불평등과 빈곤문제를 해결할 것으로 전망하는 실정이다. 제도의 취지나 당위로는 더할 나위가 없다. 관건은 재원 마련이다. 막대한 돈이 드는 기본소득을 현실로 옮길 수 있을까. 이 책 『모두의 기본소득, 재원을 마련하다』의 저자들은 “기본소득 지급도, 재원조달도 모두 가능하다”고 입을 모은다.

기본소득 재원 마련의 철학적 기초는 ‘공유부’에 있다. 토지, 환경, 지식, 데이터 등 모두에게 속한 공유부의 수익을 평등하게 나눈다는 것이다. 이 책은 기본소득으로 지급할 수 있는 재원으로서, 공유부에 근거해 정당성을 획득한 모든 방안을 다룬다.

기본소득 금액을 먼저 정하고 이에 부합하는 재정모델을 설정한 다음 지급 방안을 마련하는 접근과는 다르다. 조달 가능한 재원을 최대한으로 모색하고 그 규모를 추계해 제시하는 방식이다. 실현가능한 재원조달 방안들과 조달액 추계 범위 내에서 상황에 따라 단계별로 취할 수 있는 조합을 모색하는 데 도움이 된다.

현재 뜨겁게 논쟁이 일고 있는 메타버스에 대한 전반적인 이해를 넘어서 산업 생태계, 관리, 경제학, 기반시설 등 여러 각도에서 생각해 봐야 할 관점을 보여 준다. 저자들은 과거 디지털 경제를 연구하면서 깨달은 바에 과학 기술 분야의 가장 놀랄 만한 변혁을 결합해 향후 발전 방향의 윤곽을 정리했다.

문제는 인류가 앞으로 살아갈 이 디지털 신세계에서는 과거 전통 경제에서 당연하다고 여겨졌던 기본 원칙들이 모두 통하지 않는다는 것이다. 더구나 이 책의 서문을 쓴 이더리움의 창시자 비탈릭 부테린은 메타버스의 디지털 자산 규모가 머지않아 현실 세계의 자산 규모를 넘어설 것이라고 예언한다.

메타버스는 단순한 경제가 아니라 ‘사회’이며 더욱이 M세대(메타버스 세대)가 만든 포스트모던 사회다. 메타버스에는 경제 현상은 물론이고 문화 현상과 사회 현상도 있다. 국가, 민족, 지역, 시간의 경계를 초월한 이 사회는 어떤 문명을 만들어낼까? 이 책은 도래할 메타버스 시대를 준비하고 기회를 포착하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

블록체인이란 거래정보가 중앙 서버에 집중되지 않고, 네트워크의 여러 컴퓨터에 분산해서 저장되는 것을 말한다. 블록체인 기술에 주목하는 이유는 저렴한 비용으로 투명하고 안전한 전자금융거래가 가능해질 것이라는 기대감 때문이다. 비용 측면에서도 블록체인은 기술의 특성상 막대한 비용절감 효과를 기대할 수 있기에 금융권과 공공서비스 부문의 블록체인 도입은 더욱 활발해질 전망이다.

20세기 가장 위대한 경제학자, 케인스. 그는 경제 이론과 경제 정책에 있어 위대한 지적 혁명을 촉발시켰다. 이 책은 수학 방정식 등을 최소화하면서, 대학교 학부학생, 열린 마음을 가지고 있는 기존 강단 경제학자, 공무원 그리고 일반 경제인 등 다양한 계층의 독자 모두가 쉽게 케인스의 경제 사상을 이해할 수 있도록 설명하고 있다.

이 책은 케인스 이론의 핵심적인 개념들, 즉 시장경제에 있어서 불확실성, 균형의 의미, 화폐의 역할, 그리고 유효수요의 원칙을 설명함으로써, 이러한 핵심 개념을 철저히 무시하고 있는 기존 주류 경제학과 그 안에서의 자칭 케인지언들이 가지는 오류를 지적하고 있다.

또한 그에 비추어 현대 경제에 있어서 다양한 논쟁점들, 즉 고용과 실업의 문제, 재정과 금융 정책, 국제수지 문제 등에 대한 케인스적인 해결 방안을 시사하고 있다. 특히 그러한 논의들을 역사적 배경(베르사유조약부터 브레턴우즈 체제까지)과 연결시키고, 또한 케인스의 경제 이론이 현재의 유로존 문제에 어떤 해결점을 제시할 수 있는지도 검토한다.

지금 우리가 처한 세계를 이해하는 가장 적합한 키워드가 있다면 그것은 ‘불평등’이다. 토마 피케티는 지난 몇십 년 동안 전 세계적으로 소득과 부의 불평등이 증가했다고 말한다. 그의 책 『21세기 자본』이 촉발한 불평등이라는 주제는 경제뿐 아니라 정치, 사회적으로 경각심을 일으키고 커다란 영향을 끼쳤다. 

경제학자 이정우는 피케티의 첫 책과 함께 최근작 『자본과 이데올로기』와 여러 저명한 경제학자가 함께 쓴 『세계불평등보고서 2018』을 통해 피케티가 정확히 어떤 진단을 내리고 있는지 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 불평등 문제를 해소하기 위해 피케티가 제시한 사회국가, 누진소득세, 세계자본세 그리고 참여사회주의와 참여연방주의 등의 처방에 대해서도 살펴본다. 

저자가 피케티의 책을 안내하는 이유는 한국 사회의 불평등을 바로 보고, 그에 따른 대안을 제안하고자 하는 데 있다. 한국은 소득 불평등, 정규직과 비정규직의 양극화, 부동산으로 인한 자산 불평등이 유독 심각하다. 저자는 이 문제의 해결 없이는 한국 경제의 지속적인 발전과 선진국 진입은 어렵다고 말한다. 나아가 한국이 처한 현실을 냉정하게 드러내 보여주고, 더 나은 세상으로 바꿔나가기 위한 다양한 해법들을 제시하고 있다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 ‘테라 인코그니타: 공존을 위한 새로운 시대정신을 찾아’를 아젠다로 제안했다. 한 번도 가보지 않은 새로운 세계는 우리에게 기회가 될 수도, 위협이 될 수도 있다. 하지만 정치.경제.학술.문화 등 각 분야의 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 통해 미래를 예측하고 준비할 수 있다면, 위협 또한 기회로 바꿀 수 있을 것이다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 현재 우리가 직면한 문제를 ‘정치 변화의 역학 Global Power Dynamics’, ‘비즈니스의 새 정의 New Business Path’, ‘부의 탐색 Wealth Discovery’, ‘넷제로 레이스 Race to Net-zero’, ‘비욘드 그래비티 Beyond Gravity’, ‘새로운 세계로의 입문 Hello, New World’ 등 6개의 대주제로 정하고 이에 대한 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 들었다.

전자공학과 소프트웨어에 대한 비전공자들도 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 기초적인 파이썬 언어에 대한 내용과 리눅스 기초 명령어들을 습득하고 라즈베리파이 4 실제 보드에서 파이썬을 이용해서 간단한 센서들의 동작 원리를 바로 실습해 볼 수 있도록 하였다. 파이썬 언어 전용으로 집필되었기 때문에 프로그램 언어의 초보자들도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있고, 센서 실습도 복잡한 부품과 브레드보드(일명 빵판)를 사용하지 않고 센서 HAT보드에 연결만 하면 바로 실습이 가능하기 때문에 전자공학 비전문가들도 간단하게 따라 하기가 가능하다. 특히 최근 온라인 비대면 수업을 할 때 배선 오류에 대한 부담감을 줄일 수 있다.

TensorFlow와 sklearn을 사용해 금융이나 경제 맥락에 인공지능을 접목하는 방법론을 설명한다. 먼저 경제학이 추구하는 지향점과 머신러닝의 특징과 장점을 비교해 같은 점과 다른 점을 분석한 다음 양 측면에서 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 방대한 참고문헌과 함께 설명한다. 기초적인 회귀에서 출발해 결정 트리와 랜덤 포레스트를 살펴보고 이미지 처리와 자연어 처리가 금융 맥락에서 어떻게 활발하게 활용되고 있는지 설명한다. 특히 자연어 처리 부분이 금융 맥락과 접목되는 지점은 다양한 실습과 예제를 통해 손쉽게 이해하도록 돕는다.

금융 데이터의 특징인 시계열 데이터는 RNN과 LSTM를 활용해 설명한다. 또한 생성적 모델을 적용하는 방법과 이론적 모델 부분도 다룬다. 각 장은 모두 예제와 코드를 지원하며 이를 통해 각 상황을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 기초를 제공한다. 책에서 제공하는 방대한 참고문헌은 금융 맥락에서 인공지능을 접목하려던 수많은 학자의 발자취를 살펴볼 귀중한 자료다.
