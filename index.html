                    <span>We identify monetary policy shocks by exploiting variation in the central bank’s information set. To be specific, we use differences between nowcasts of the output gap and inflation with final, revised estimates of these series to isolate movements in the policy rate unrelated to economic conditions. We then compute the effects of a monetary policy shock on the aggregate economy using local projection methods. We find that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a limited negative effect on output but a persistent negative impact on prices. In contrast to alternative identification approaches, we do not observe a price puzzle when analyzing the period from 1987 to 2008. Further, we validate the identification approach in a simple New Keynesian model, augmented by the assumption that the central bank observes the ingredients of the Taylor rule with error.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the relevance of cognitive uncertainty – subjective uncertainty over one&#x27;s utility-maximizing action – for understanding and predicting intertemporal choice. The main idea is that when people are cognitively noisy, such as when a decision is complex, they implicitly treat different time delays to some degree alike. By experimentally measuring and manipulating cognitive uncertainty, we document  three economic implications of this idea. First,  cognitive uncertainty explains various core empirical regularities, such as why people often appear very impatient, why per-period impatience is smaller over long than over short horizons, why discounting is often hyperbolic even when the present is not involved, and why choices frequently violate transitivity. Second, impatience is context-dependent: discounting is substantially more hyperbolic when the decision environment is more complex. Third, cognitive uncertainty matters for choice architecture: people who are nervous about making mistakes are twice as likely to follow expert advice to be more patient.</span>

                    <span>AT&amp;T was the largest U.S. firm for most of the 20th century. Telephone operators once comprised over 50% of its workforce, but in the late 1910s it initiated a decades-long process of automating telephone operation with mechanical call switching—a technology first invented in the 1880s. We study what drove AT&amp;T to do so, and why it took one firm nearly a century to automate this one basic function. Interdependencies between operators and nearly every other part of the business were obstacles: the manual switchboard was the fulcrum of a complex system which had developed around it, and automation only began after the firm and automatic technology were adapted to work together. Even then, automatic switching was only profitable for AT&amp;T in larger markets—hence diffusion expanded as costs declined and service areas grew. We show that automation supported AT&amp;T&#x27;s continued growth, generating a positive feedback loop between scale and automation that reinforced AT&amp;T&#x27;s high market share in local markets.</span>

                    <span>Many African countries are still in the early stages of structural transformation. Typically, as economies move through the structural transformation, activities once conducted within the household are outsourced to the market. This has particular implications for women’s time use. In this paper, we document that current patterns of female time use in home production in several African countries closely resemble historical time use patterns in the US. We highlight two stylized facts about women’s time use in Africa. First, in North Africa, women spend very few hours in market work and female labor force participation overall is extremely low. Second, although extensive margin participation of women is high in sub-Saharan Africa, women tend to work in the market for only a few hours each week, with the rest of their work hours spent in home production. These two facts suggest two types of constraints that could slow down the reallocation of female time from home to market as economies grow: Social norms related to women’s market work, and a lack of infrastructure (e.g. household infrastructure and childcare facilities) to facilitate marketizing home production. We discuss recent empirical evidence related to each set of constraints and highlight new avenues for research.</span>

                    <span>The generosity of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits was expanded during the pandemic (FPUC), along with the groups of workers eligible for benefits (PUA). These two programs were set to expire in September 2021, but 18 states opted out of both in June 2021. Using Current Population Survey data, we present difference-in-difference and event study estimates that the flow of unemployed workers into employment increased by around two-thirds following early termination. We construct a counterfactual scenario that implies the national unemployment rate in each of July and August would have been around 0.3 percentage point lower than they were, and the employment-population ratio would have been around 0.1-0.2 percentage point higher than it was, had all states ended FPUC and PUA in June. Expanded eligibility and generosity of UI may have both slowed transitions from unemployment to employment. We also present some suggestive evidence that households with relatively high confidence in their ability to meet expenses may have been less sensitive to the termination of expanded benefits. Finally, we present evidence that early termination reduced the share of households that had no difficulty meeting expenses by five percent. The welfare implications of the early termination of FPUC and PUA are therefore ambiguous.</span>

                    <span>We study relational contracts among managers using unique data that tracks transfers of workers across teams in Indian ready-made garment factories. We focus on how relational contracts help managers cope with worker absenteeism shocks, which are frequent, often large, weakly correlated across teams, and which substantially reduce team productivity. Together these facts imply gains from sharing workers. We show that managers respond to shocks by lending and borrowing workers in a manner consistent with relational contracting, but many potentially beneficial transfers are unrealized. This is because managers’ primary relationships are with a very small subset of potential partners. A borrowing event study around main trading partners’ separations from the firm reinforces the importance of relationships. We show robustness to excluding worker moves least likely to reflect relational borrowing responses to idiosyncratic absenteeism shocks. Counterfactual simulations reveal large gains to reducing costs associated with forming and maintaining additional relationships among managers.</span>

                    <span>This paper provides general and empirically implementable sufficient statistics formulas for optimal nonlinear tax systems in the presence of preference heterogeneity. We study unrestricted tax systems on income and savings (or other commodities) that implement the optimal direct-revelation mechanism, as well as simpler tax systems that impose common restrictions like separability between earnings and savings taxes. We characterize the optimum using familiar elasticity concepts and a sufficient statistic for across-income preference heterogeneity: the difference between the cross-sectional variation of savings with income, and the causal effect of income on savings. The Atkinson-Stiglitz Theorem is a knife-edge case corresponding to zero difference, and a number of other key results in optimal tax theory are subsumed as special cases. Our formulas also apply to other sources of across-income heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in rates of return on savings, inheritances, and the ability to shift income between tax bases. We provide tractable extensions of these results that include multidimensional heterogeneity, additional efficiency rationales for taxing heterogeneous returns, and corrective motives to encourage more saving. Applying these formulas in a calibrated model of the U.S. economy, we find that the optimal savings tax is positive and progressive.</span>

                    <span>Employment in STEM occupations suffered smaller peak-to-trough percentage declines than non-STEM occupations during the Great Recession and COVID-19 recession, suggesting a relative resiliency of STEM employment.  We exploit the sudden peak-to-trough declines in STEM and non-STEM employment during the COVID-19 recession to measure STEM recession-resiliency, decomposing our difference-in-differences estimate into parts explained by various sources.  We find that STEM knowledge importance on the job explains the greatest share of STEM employment resiliency, and that workers in non-STEM occupations who nonetheless use STEM knowledge experienced better employment outcomes. STEM employment resiliency may explain the mild effects of COVID-19 on innovative activity.</span>

                    <span>The design of a trade agreement should reflect its purpose. Does digital trade change the purpose of a trade agreement? To explore this question, I first describe the definitional and classification issues associated with digital trade, and for modeling purposes I adopt a simple taxonomy of the ways in which digital trade can arise and the policies that can be used to restrict such trade. I then review what the theoretical literature on the economics of trade agreements has to say about the purpose of a trade agreement in a pre-digital model world economy, and how this purpose can be seen to be reflected in the broad design features of both GATT and GATS, the WTO agreements that govern international trade in goods and services respectively. Finally, I introduce digital trade into the model world economy and revisit the purpose of a trade agreement. From this perspective I consider whether the rise of digital trade warrants changes in the design of the WTO.</span>

                    <span>This paper revisits Peltzman (1973) in light of two recent opportunities to quantitatively assess tradeoffs in drug regulation.  First, reduced regulatory barriers to drug manufacturing associated with the 2017 reauthorization of Generic Drug User Fee Amendments were followed by significantly more entry and lower consumer prices for prescription drugs.  Using a simple and versatile industry model and historical data on entry, I find that easing generic restrictions discourages innovation, but this welfare cost is more than offset by consumer benefits from enhanced competition, especially after 2016.  Second, accelerated vaccine approval in 2020 had unprecedented net benefits as it not only improved health but substantially changed the trajectory of the wider economy.  The evidence suggests that cost-benefit analysis of FDA regulation is incomplete without accounting for substitution toward potentially unsafe and ineffective treatments that are both outside FDA jurisdiction and heavily utilized prior to FDA approval.  Moreover, the policy processes initiating these 21st century regulatory changes show a clear influence of Peltzman’s 1973 findings.</span>

                    <span>The attractive properties of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm rest on the assumption of perfect information. Yet field studies of school matching show that information is imperfect, particularly for disadvantaged students. We model costly strategic learning when schools are ex ante symmetric, agree on their ranking of students, and learning is rationally inattentive. Our analytic solution quantifies how each student’s rank, learning costs and prior beliefs interact to determine their gross and net welfare as well as the extent and form of mistakes they make. In line with the evidence, we find that lower-ranked students are affected disproportionately more by information costs, generally suffering a larger welfare loss than higher-ranked students. Interactions between mechanism design, inattention and inequity are thus of first order importance.</span>

Households were assigned to free insurance, sale of insurance, sale plus cash transfer, or control.  To estimate spillovers, the fraction of households offered insurance varied across villages.  The opportunity to purchase insurance led to 59.91% uptake and access to free insurance to 78.71% uptake.  Access increased insurance utilization. Positive spillover effects on utilization suggest learning from peers.  Many beneficiaries were unable to use insurance, demonstrating hurdles to expanding access via insurance.

                    <span>The rise, fall, and stabilization of US inflation between 1969 and 2005 is consistent with a model of shifting policy regimes that features a forward-looking New Keynesian Phillips curve, policymakers that can or cannot commit, and private sector learning about policymaker type. Using model-implied inflation forecasting rules to extract state variables from the inflation forecasts in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we provide evidence that policy regimes without commitment prevailed before 1980 and regimes with commitment prevailed afterward. With theory and quantification, we find that evolution of reputational capital is central to understanding the behavior of inflation.</span>

                    <span>Digital credit has expanded rapidly in Africa, mostly in the form of short-term, high-interest loans offered via mobile money. Loan terms are often opaque and consumer financial literacy is low, providing opportunities for predatory lending. A regression discontinuity analysis shows no negative effect of access to digital loans on financial well-being, but the majority of borrowers fail to repay on time and incur high late fees. We randomize exposure to a short phone-based financial literacy intervention. The intervention improved knowledge and marginally improved loan repayment but increased loan demand, increasing overall default risk.</span>

                    <span>Manufacturing has made an important contribution to raising living standards in many parts of the world. Concerns about premature deindustrialization have made some observers skeptical about the potential for manufacturing to play this role in Africa. But employment in African manufacturing has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. These employment gains have been accompanied by: (i) large increases in the number of small manufacturing firms; (ii) limited employment gains in large firms; and (iii) robust labor productivity growth in Africa’s large firms. Limited employment growth in Africa’s large manufacturing firms is partly a result of the capital intensity of the manufacturing sub-sectors in which African countries are most engaged – the processing of resources, and partly a result of rising capital intensity in manufacturing. The potential for manufacturing to raise living standards in Africa depends on indirect job creation by large firms through backward and forward linkages and increasing labor productivity in small firms.</span>

                    <span>Job seekers often face substantial information frictions related to potential job quality. This is especially true in international labor markets, where intermediaries match prospective migrants with employers abroad. We conducted a randomized trial in Indonesia to explore how information about intermediary quality shapes migration choices and outcomes. Information reduces the migration rate, lowering use of low-quality intermediaries. However, workers who migrate receive better pre-departure preparation and have higher-quality job experiences abroad, despite no change in occupation or destination. Information does not change intentions to migrate or beliefs about the return to migration or intermediary quality. Nor does selection explain the improved outcomes for workers who choose to migrate with the information. Together, our findings are consistent with an increase in the option value of search: with better ability to differentiate offer quality, workers become choosier and ultimately have better migration experiences. This offers a new perspective on the importance of information and matching frictions in global labor markets.</span>

                    <span>Women may under-report intimate partner violence (IPV) in surveys due to a variety of social and psychological factors. To understand if anonymized interviewing can allay this concern, we conduct a measurement experiment in rural Liberia and Malawi in which women were asked IPV questions via either self-interviewing (SI) or face-to-face interviewing (FTFI) with an enumerator. We find that about a third of women incorrectly answer basic screening questions over SI, and that it generates placebo effects on innocuous questions even for those who &quot;pass&quot; screening. Because the probability of responding &quot;yes&quot; to any specific IPV question is less than 50%, and that IPV is typically reported as an index (reporting yes to at least one question in a category of violence), such misunderstanding will tend to increase IPV reporting. In Malawi, we find that SI dramatically increases reported IPV, with the incidence of any type of IPV increasing by 13 percentage points on a base of 20%; in Liberia, we find an insignificant and modest increase of 4 percentage points on a base of 39%. Our results suggest SI may spuriously increase reported IPV rates.</span>

                    <span>We draw upon newly merged administrative data sets to study the relationship between payments from medical technology firms to physicians and medical device procurement by hospitals. These payments (and the interactions that accompany them) may facilitate the transfer of valuable information to and from physicians. However, they may also influence physicians’ treatment decisions, and in turn hospital device procurement, in favor of paying firms. Payments are pervasive: 87 percent of device sales in our sample occurred at a hospital where a relevant physician received a payment from a device firm. Payments are also highly correlated with spending within a firm-hospital pair: event studies suggest that a large positive increase in payments to a given hospital from a given firm ($438 per physician on average, or 112 percent of the mean) is associated with 27 percent higher expenditures on the paying firm’s devices post-event. Finally, we explore how payments mediate the relationship between expertise and device procurement patterns. Hospitals affiliated with the top Academic Medical Centers (AMCs), which plausibly represent an expert benchmark, purchase a different mix of devices than other hospitals, and payments to hospitals outside the top AMCs are correlated with larger deviations from the procurement patterns of top AMC hospitals.</span>

                    <span>Youth employment has been near historic lows in recent years, and racial gaps persist. This paper tests whether information frictions limit young people&#x27;s labor market success with a field experiment involving over 43,000 youth in New York City. We build software that allows employers to quickly and easily produce letters of recommendation for randomly selected youth who worked under their supervision during a summer youth employment program. We then send these letters to nearly 9,000 youth over two years. Being sent a letter generates a 3 percentage point (4.5 percent) increase in employment the following year, with both employment and earnings increases persisting over the two-year follow-up period. By posting our own job advertisement, we document that while treatment youth do use the letters in applications, there is no evidence of other supply-side responses (i.e., no increased job search, motivation, or confidence); effects appear to be driven by the demand side. Labor market benefits accrue primarily to racial and ethnic minorities, suggesting frictions may contribute to racial employment gaps. But improved employment may also hamper on-time high school graduation. Additional evidence indicates that letters help improve job match quality. Results suggest that expanding the availability credible signals about young workers—particularly for those not on the margin of graduating high school—could improve the efficiency of the youth labor market.</span>

                    <span>A growing literature identifies associations between subjective and biometric indicators of wellbeing.  These associations, together with the ability of subjective wellbeing (SWB) metrics to predict health and behavioral outcomes, have spawned increasing interest in SWB as an important concept in its own right.  However, some social scientists continue to question the usefulness of SWB metrics.  We contribute to this literature in three ways.  First, we introduce a biometric measure of wellbeing – pulse – which has been largely overlooked.  Using nationally representative data on 165,000 individuals from the Health Survey for England (HSE) and Scottish Health Surveys (SHeS) we show that its correlates are similar in a number of ways to those for SWB, and that it is highly correlated with SWB metrics, as well as self-assessed health.  Second, we examine the determinants of pulse rates in mid-life (age 42) among the 9,000 members of the National Child Development Study (NCDS), a birth cohort born in a single week in 1958 in Britain.  Third, we track the impact of pulse measured in mid-life (age 42) on health and labor market outcomes at age 50 in 2008 and age 55 in 2013.  The probability of working at age 55 is negatively impacted by pulse rate a decade earlier.  The pulse rate has an impact over and above chronic pain measured at age 42.  General health at 55 is lower the higher the pulse rate at age 42, while those with higher pulse rates at 42 also express lower life satisfaction and more pessimism about the future at age 50.  Taken together, these results suggest social scientists can learn a great deal by adding pulse rates to the metrics they use when evaluating people’s wellbeing.</span>

  From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&amp;P 500 and DOW futures are up slightly (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $73.79 per barrel and Brent at $76.14 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $48, and Brent was at $51 - so WTI oil prices are up 50% year-over-year. 
Here is a graph from Gasbuddy.com for nationwide gasoline prices.  Nationally prices are at $3.25 per gallon.  A year ago prices were at $2.24 per gallon, so gasoline prices are up $1.01 per gallon year-over-year.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Question #10 for 2022: Will inventory increase as the pandemic subsides, or will inventory decrease further in 2022?
Brief excerpt: 
Earlier I posted some questions on my blog for next year: Ten Economic Questions for 2022.   Some of these questions concern real estate (inventory, house prices, housing credit, housing starts, new home sales), and I’ll post those in the newsletter (others like GDP and employment will be on my blog).
I&#x27;m adding some thoughts, and maybe some predictions for each question. 
...
And the sharp decline in inventory during the pandemic (green arrow) was an indicator that price appreciation would increase. Inventory declined due to a combination of potential sellers keeping their properties off the market during a pandemic, and a pickup in buying due to record low mortgage rates, a move away from multi-family rentals and strong second home buying (to escape the high-density cities). And at the same time, demographics were favorable for home buying (a large cohort has moved into the peak home buying years).
...
First, it appears we will see record low inventories over the next few months. This suggests we will see further strong price gains over the next several months (with low inventories).
In 2021, the NAR showed inventory bottomed in January and (inventory bottoms in December), however the local MLS data, and the Altos Research data, showed inventory bottomed even later than usual - in March or early April 2021.  If 2022 follows the normal seasonal pattern, we will see inventory increasing by February (and maybe even in January).
The timing of the seasonal bottom will be important this year.  If inventory bottoms seasonally in December, we might see inventory increase YoY later in 2022.  However, if inventory doesn&#x27;t bottom until March or April, we will probably see another crazy year with little inventory.

Brief excerpt: 
“In a report last month, I wrote about how data from Redfin and CoreLogic indicated that there had been a surge in investor buying of SF homes in the second and third quarters of this year, with some of the biggest increases coming from “large” investors.
One private company that has massively increased its holdings of SF residential properties is Pretium Partners, a “specialized investment manager” with a huge portfolio of SF residential properties for rent. (Pretium owns Progress Residential, which has recently gotten some negative press.)
According to Pretium’s website, Pretium has increased the number of SF properties it owns from 41,000 at the end of 2020 to 70,700 at the end of September 2021.

                    <span>Here is a review of the Ten Economic Questions for 2021
Below are my ten questions for 2022.  These are just questions; I&#x27;ll follow up with some thoughts on each of these questions.
The purpose of these questions is to provide a framework to think about how the U.S. economy will perform in 2022, and if there are surprises - like in 2020 - to adjust my thinking.

A key question is when will the pandemic subside significantly?  This will have a huge economic impact but is a question for infectious disease experts.   The good news is a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, and there are effective drugs on the way.  Science should continue to make progress against the virus.

                    <span>Note: At the beginning of the pandemic, the delinquency rate increased sharply (see table below).   Loans in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this survey, but those loans are not reported as delinquent to the credit bureaus.
From Black Knight: Mortgage Delinquencies Continue Steady Improvement; Active Foreclosures Fall to Yet Another Record Low Entering Final Month of 2021
• The national delinquency rate saw yet another month of steady improvement, with November’s 4.1% monthly decline matching the 18-month average rate of reduction
  
• Despite serious delinquencies (loans 90+ days past due but not in foreclosure) falling another 80,000 from October, over 1 million such delinquencies remain, 2.5 times more than at the start of the pandemic

자본주의의 태동부터 지금까지, 금융의 세계에 뛰어든 수많은 참여자는 혁신, 실수 그리고 의도하지 않았던 추문을 통해 지금의 월스트리트를 만들었다. 미국의 억만장자 투자자 겸 피셔 인베스트먼트 설립자이자 33년 동안 《포브스》에 칼럼을 연재한 칼럼니스트 켄 피셔는 자신만의 기준에 따라 월스트리트를 만든 100명의 인물을 선발하여 그들의 업적, 사건, 사생활 등을 매력적인 문체로 풀어냈다. 

그가 선정한 100명이 모두 존경할 만한 인물은 아니다. 하지만 경제학자부터 언론인, 사기범, 투기꾼까지 다양한 분야의 인물로 구성된 이들은 어떤 형태로든 현재의 금융 시장에 절대적인 영향을 미쳤고, 우리는 이들의 짧은 전기를 통해 자본주의를 바라보는 올바른 시각을 얻을 수 있다. 

켄 피셔는 자본주의의 역사 속에서 명예 혹은 불명예를 얻은 100명을 조명하며, 이들의 이야기가 현재에 전하는 메시지가 무엇인지 고찰한다. 그것은 과거는 반복된다는 점이고, 과거를 알지 못하는 자는 실패를 반복하게 된다는 것이다.

                    <span>According to the OECD, social mobility in Germany is lower than in most other developed economies, reigniting a debate on equality of opportunity and shortcomings of the education system. This column discusses how census data can be used to obtain high quality mobility statistics for Germany. Using the Abitur educational qualification as a measure of opportunity, it suggests that relative mobility has remained constant for recent birth cohorts but points to substantial geographic variation in mobility measures across regions in the country.</span>

                    <span>Global warming is expected to dramatically reduce agricultural productivity in hotter parts of the world. This column considers ways to accommodate that change. Hot, poor countries would benefit by shifting away from agriculture into less vulnerable, non-agricultural sectors as temperatures rise, but such a reallocation of resources is unlikely without a major increase in global trade integration. As long as poor countries import little of their food, they are likely to continue specialising in agriculture to meet domestic subsistence needs, even as their farms become increasingly vulnerable to climate change.</span>

                    <span>Freddie Mac reported that the Single-Family serious delinquency rate in November was 1.24%, down from 1.32% in October.  Freddie&#x27;s rate is down year-over-year from 2.75% in November 2020.
Freddie&#x27;s serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are &quot;three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure&quot;.

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but are not reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.09%, down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.</span>

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Although down compared to 2019, the 4-week average of the occupancy rate is now above the median rate for the previous 20 years (Blue).


Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The 4-week average of the occupancy rate will bottom seasonally over the next few weeks.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: New Home Sales: Record 110 thousand homes have not been started
Brief excerpt: 
Sales, year to date in 2021, are 6.5% below sales in 2020, and new home sales in 2021 will finish solidly below sales in 2020 - since sales in 2020 finished strong.
This graph shows new home sales for 2020 and 2021 by month (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
The year-over-year comparisons were easy in the first half of 2021 - especially in March and April. However, sales will be down year-over-year again in December - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
...
The next graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction. “Months of supply” is inventory at each stage, divided by the sales rate.
The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 39 thousand in November, up from the record low of 33 thousand in March, April, May and July 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (red line). This is about half the normal level.
The inventory of new homes under construction is at 4.1 months (blue line) - well above the normal level. This elevated level of homes under construction is due to supply chain constraints.
And a record 110 thousand homes have not been started - about 1.8 months of supply (grey line) - almost double the normal level. Homebuilders are probably waiting to start some homes until they have a firmer grasp on prices.

                    <span>The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in November were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 744 thousand.
The previous three months were revised down significantly. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in November 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 744,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 12.4 percent above the revised October rate of 662,000, but is 14.0 percent below the November 2020 estimate of 865,000.

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.
New home sales are now declining year-over-year since sales soared following the first few months of the pandemic.
The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply.
The months of supply decreased in November to 6.5 months from 7.1 months in October. 
The all-time record high was 12.1 months of supply in January 2009.  The all-time record low was 3.5 months, most recently in October 2020.
This is above the normal range (about 4 to 6 months of supply is normal).
&quot;The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 402,000.  This represents a supply of 6.5 months at the current sales rate.&quot;
The last graph shows sales NSA (monthly sales, not seasonally adjusted annual rate).
In November 2021 (red column), 53 thousand new homes were sold (NSA).  Last year, 61 thousand homes were sold in November.
The all-time high for November was 86 thousand in 2005, and the all-time low for November was 20 thousand in 2010.
This was below expectations of 766 thousand SAAR, and sales in the three previous months were revised down significantly.  I&#x27;ll have more later today.</span>

                    <span>Rising dispersion in productivity across firms has focused attention on the drivers of superior performances of a minority of firms at the ‘productivity frontier’ and disappointing performances of the remaining ‘productivity laggards’. This column brings together data from ten countries to explore how differences in productivity outcomes of frontier and laggard firms depend on the composition, diversity, and competencies of their managers and their workers. Overall, this ‘human side’ explains about a third of the observed differences in productivity across firms, more than is accounted for by differences in capital intensity.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented fiscal stimulus by many governments to counter the economic recession. This column uses high-frequency data on government spending, lockdown restrictions, and economic indicators in the US to assess the effectiveness of fiscal policy. It shows that government spending increased employment, but only in cities not subject to strict stay-at-home restrictions. It also shows that consumer spending shifted strongly toward durable goods during the pandemic. Well-targeted fiscal measures will be crucial in the case of another recessionary outbreak, especially transfers to firms on the brink of exit.</span>

This column uses responses from surveys of a representative sample of the US population as well as academic economists and US firm managers to show that households and managers are more likely than experts to think that the current surge in inflation will be persistent. Since the narratives individuals use to explain movements in inflation appear central to whether inflation expectations remain anchored, communication strategies by policymakers could put emphasis on specific narratives that highlight that inflationary pressures are unlikely to persist.</span>

      - Refinance originations are expected to drop to $870B.
      - Purchase originations are forecast to eclipse 2021’s record high and reach $1.74T, backed by strong housing demand and rising home prices and sales.
• Home-price growth is forecast to moderate to 5.1%.
• Mortgage rates are expected to rise throughout the year and reach 4.0% by December 2022. 
• Economic growth is forecast to be at 4.0% in 2022, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% by the end of the year.</span>

Excerpt: 
This graph shows existing home sales by month for 2020 and 2021.
This was the fourth consecutive month with sales down year-over-year. Sales will likely be down YoY in December and probably in January 2022 too since were exceptionally strong last Winter.
...
[and on inventory] Months-of-supply at 2.1 months is very low, but still above the record low of 1.9 months set in December 2020 and January 2021.  That record will be tested next month.
We will probably see inventory at a new record low over the Winter. Inventory is currently at 1.11 million (according to the NAR), and the record low was 1.03 million in January and February of 2021.

Existing-home sales rose in November, denoting three consecutive months of increases, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Three of the four major U.S. regions reported growth in monthly sales, while the fourth region held steady in November. From a year-over-year perspective, only one region experienced a rise in sales as the three others saw home sales decline.
  
Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, grew 1.9% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.46 million in November. Sales fell 2.0% from a year ago (6.59 million in November 2020).

                    <span>From the BEA: Gross Domestic Product (Third Estimate), Corporate Profits (Revised Estimate), and GDP by Industry, Third Quarter 2021
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the third quarter of 2021, according to the &quot;third&quot; estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 6.7 percent.
  
The “third” estimate of GDP released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the &quot;second&quot; estimate issued last month. In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was 2.1 percent. The update primarily reflects upward revisions to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and private inventory investment that were partly offset by a downward revision to exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, were revised down. 
emphasis added
Here is a Comparison of Third and Second Estimates.  PCE growth was revised up from 1.7% to 2.0%. Residential investment was revised up from -8.3% to -7.7%.</span>

반도체는 ‘21세기의 전략물자’, ‘산업의 쌀’이라 불리며 휴대폰, PC, 자동차 등의 생산에 꼭 필요한 현대산업에 없어서는 안 될 중요 자원으로 손꼽힌다. 이미 기업 간의 경쟁을 넘어 국가 대 국가로 번지고 있던 반도체 패권을 향한 각국의 움직임이 2020년, 코로나19로 인해 자동차 반도체 품귀가 발생하며 전 세계적인 차원으로 확산됐다. 

각국은 반도체 산업에 대한 지배력이 국가 안보와 경쟁력과 직결된다는 것을 깨닫고, 공급망이 끊겨 문제가 생기지 않도록 반도체 내수화와 핵심 소재 공급망 다변화, 기업간 M&amp;A를 추진하며 국가적 차원의 공격적인 조치와 투자를 단행하고 있다.

훗날 ‘세계 제1차 반도체 대전’으로 기록될지도 모르는 치열한 반도체 패권 다툼 속에서 우리는 어떻게 대처하고 무엇을 준비해야 할까. 한국경제신문 황정수 기자가 현대산업의 중심 실리콘밸리에서 특파원으로 근무하며 취재한 내용을 바탕으로 집필한 이 책을 통해 우리는 반도체 산업에 대한 정확한 이해와 k-반도체의 나아갈 방향을 예측할 수 있을 것이다.

제목 그대로 김우석 작가가 지닌 투자에 관련된 모든 이야기를 모아 놓은 집성체와 같다. 선박금융 프로젝트 분석부터 개인적으로 시작했던 여러 가지 투자 방법과 실패담을 가감 없이 담았다. 또한, 선박의 종류와 그것의 특징을 자세하게 담아 투자 시 이점과 주의해야 할 사항을 파악할 수 있도록 했다.

이 책에는 실제로 그 당시 사람들이 어떻게 투자했고 얼마의 이익을 보았으며, 어떤 규모로 손실을 입었는지 설명하는 것에서 끝나지 않는다. 당시에 투자자가 이익을 보거나 손실을 입은 배경을 설명하고, 그때의 상황에서 어떻게 하면 더 큰 이익을 보았을지 혹은 손실을 피할 수 있었을지를 제시한다. 마치 공부를 잘하는 전교 1등의 오답 노트를 얻게 된 것이나 마찬가지다.

저자는 책에서 선택은 항상 본인의 몫이라는 것을 잊지 말라고 강조한다. 또한 의사결정자는 항상 정직하고 본인에게 엄격해야 한다는 것을 언급한다. 투자는 단 한 번의 기회로 커다란 이익을 볼 수 있는 일명 일확천금의 &#x27;로또&#x27;가 아니다. 철저하게 자신을 분석하고 커다란 세계의 경제를 냉철하게 판단해야만 비로소 조금씩 성공을 거둘 수 있다. 그러한 복잡한 시황 속에서 이른바 &#x27;투자 성공기&#x27;를 맞이하기 위해 고군분투한 저자의 스토리에 주목하기를 바란다.

『선형대수와 통계학으로 배우는 머신러닝 with 파이썬』의 장철원 저자가 선형대수 기초를 다잡고 싶은 독자를 위해 집필한 선형대수 책이다. 기초적인 행렬부터 고차원 텐서까지 선형대수를 구성하는 개념 및 이론을 소개하고 독자 스스로 자신의 분야에 응용할 수 있도록 도와준다. 또한, 선형대수 이론이 의미하는 바를 자세히 설명하고 선형대수 이론을 파이썬 코드로 직접 구현함으로써 내 손으로 선형대수 라이브러리를 직접 만드는 즐거움을 선사한다.

실습은 두 파트로 나뉜다. 파이썬 실습 파트에서는 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 순수 파이썬 코드로 선형대수 이론을 직접 구현해 봄으로써 선형대수 기본기를 탄탄하게 다진다. 넘파이 실습 파트에서는 파이썬에서 제공하는 넘파이 라이브러리를 활용해 선형대수 이론을 활용하는 방법을 다룬다.

                    <span>The Federal Reserve has recently changed monetary stance and signalled a faster than anticipated pace of monetary tightening, while the ECB is more dovish. This column applies a statistical model to recent data on oil prices, inflation, expectations, labour markets and output, and finds that the model’s forecasts support the difference in stance of the two central banks. Based on an assessment of cyclical inflation being mostly driven by transitory energy price disturbances and a very small Phillips curve contribution in both jurisdictions, it predicts that in a year from now euro area HICP inflation will still be below the 2% target, at 1.75%, while in the US CPI inflation will be above, at 2.75%.</span>

                    <span>Carbon pricing is increasingly used by governments to reduce emissions. Using data from 21 European countries, this column considers how education quality interacts with the effect of carbon pricing on emissions, output, and wage inequality. Cognitive skills are associated with lower emissions per output and faster reductions in emissions per output across time. The association is primarily with the cognitive skills of professional and managerial occupations, which would be most involved in innovation and adoption.</span>

                    <span>What are central banks held accountable for by elected officials? This column employs structural topic models on a new dataset of the Monetary Dialogues between the Members of the European Parliament and the President of the ECB to reveal differences in how MEPs keep the ECB accountable for its primary objective of price stability. It also shows that unemployment is a key explanatory variable for the political voice articulated by individual MEPs in accountability settings. These findings reveal the existence of a ‘political’ Phillips curve reaction function.</span>

                    <span>CR Note: I&#x27;ve mentioned the increasing use of non-QM loans before.
Here is an interesting article on non-QM loans By Bill Conroy at Housing Wire: Move over Fannie, the non-QM loan is in the fast lane.  Some brief excerpts: 
The universe of non-QM single-family mortgage products is broad and difficult to define in a few words, but the definition matters because a huge slice of the borrowers in this non-QM category represent the heartbeat of the U.S. economy. Within its sweep are the self-employed as well as entrepreneurs who buy single-family investment properties — and who can’t qualify for a mortgage using traditional documentation, such as payroll income. As a result, they must rely on alternative documentation, including bank statements, assets or, in the case of rental properties, debt-service coverage ratios.

Non-QM mortgages also go to a slice of borrowers facing credit challenges — such as a recent bankruptcy or slightly out-of-bounds credit scores. The loans may include interest-only, 40-year terms or other creative financing features often designed to lower monthly payments on the front-end of the mortgage — often with an eye toward refinancing or selling the property in the short-term future.
The size of the market is relatively small (about $25 billion in 2021 but growing).  And the underwriting is generally solid, but this will be a segment of mortgage lending to watch.</span>

                    <span>Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: 5th Look at Local Housing Markets in November
Excerpt: 
This update adds Boston, Indiana, and Washington, D.C.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 15.3% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 26.0% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 22.5% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that five million jobs lost during the pandemic have not been recovered, but it is difficult to ascertain how many workers will return to available jobs. The Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey includes a detailed set of reasons for nonemployment, including households’ responses to the pandemic that provide a new perspective on reasons for not working. Among prime-age workers, reasons for nonemployment during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic have shifted substantially from mostly labor demand reasons to primarily labor supply inhibitors. At this point, most nonemployment is connected to three categories: sickness and concerns about CO…</span>

디지털 시대에 리더는 어떤 역할을 해야 하고 어떤 전략과 실행력을 갖추어야 하는지를 담고 있다. 연세대학교 경영대학 임일 교수와 이무원 교수가 함께 썼다. 지금은 IT가 빠르게 세상을 바꿔 가는 4차 산업혁명 시대이자 디지털 대전환의 시대다. 기업 리더들은 워낙 빨리 발전하고 복잡하게 변화하는 IT 기술을 따라가면서 또 미래 전략까지 짜야 하는 어려움에 부닥쳐 있다. 디지털을 하지 않으면 기업 생존이 위험해질 정도로 혁신의 요구와 변화의 속도는 거세고 빠르고 강하다. 그러다 보니 리더십도 더는 과거의 것을 고집하기가 어려워졌다. 디지털 시대에는 그에 맞는 리더십이 요구되기 때문이다. 이른바 디지털 리더십이다. 리더들의 디지털 리더십 전환이 필요하다. 

그럼 디지털 리더십이란 무엇인가? 기존 리더십과는 무엇이 다른가? 이 책에서는 디지털 리더십이란 현재 그리고 앞으로 어떤 디지털 기술을 어떻게 비즈니스에 활용할지에 대한 통찰력을 바탕으로 비즈니스를 이끌어가는 것이라고 정의한다. 디지털 리더십을 갖추려면 디지털 기술에 대한 이해, 디지털 기술 활용으로 얻을 수 있는 비즈니스 기회를 포착하는 통찰력, 그리고 디지털 기술을 효과적으로 실현하는 실행력 등이 필요하다는 것이다.

우리나라에서 가장 오래된 빵집, 근대 유산이 숨쉬는 힙한 관광지로 유명한 군산에 대해 우리가 미처 몰랐던 모습을 담은 르포르타주. 2017년 7월 현대중공업 군산 조선소 가동 중단, 2018년 5월 한국지엠 군산 공장 운영 중단 이후, 저자는 &#x27;몰락한 도시의 사람들은 어떻게 되었는가?&#x27;라는 질문을 안고 군산으로 향했다. 6주 동안 30여 명의 평범한 사람들을 만나 이야기를 나눴다.

공장이 떠난 뒤 그곳에 남겨진 사람들의 삶이 잔인할 정도로 생생하게 기록되어 있다. 매달 지급되던 180만 원 실업 급여 지급이 마감되는 순간, 재취업을 희망했으나 결국 치킨집을 차릴 수밖에 없었던 현실, 실직한 남편 대신 취업 전선에 뛰어드는 아내들, 비정규직 노동자들이 떠받치던 원룸촌과 상가에 남은 떠돌이 개들, 역사와 문화의 도시에서 기업과 함께 사람들도 빠져나가는 과정 등은 단순히 서쪽 끝 작은 도시에서 일어난 일이라고 치부하기엔 너무나도 현실적이다. 2019년 7월 《한겨레21》 커버 기사 〈공장이 떠난 도시 군산〉을 바탕으로 이후의 변화와 저자의 소회까지 담아 한 권의 책으로 엮었다.


프롤로그: 군산 가는 길

실제 이론을 코드로 구현하는 데에는 많은 현실적인 격차가 존재하고, 이론을 완벽히 이해한다고 해도 코드로 구현한다는 건 또 다른 문제이다. 그래서 이 책에서는 비지도 학습의 이론을 간단하게 살펴본 후에 알고리즘의 이론과 수식을 여러 단계로 나누고 파이썬 코드로 단계별 결과들을 최대한 상세하게 다루었다.

또한 텐서플로 2의 오토 인코더와 함께 사용하는 주요 딥러닝 이론들을 실습하고 딥러닝의 활성화 함수, 손실 함수, RNN, CNN, LSTM 등을 소개한다. 마지막으로 다양한 예제 데이터와 함께 그동안 배웠던 이론을 적용하고 머신러닝으로 직접 코딩하면서 결과물을 완성할 수 있도록 했다.

경기가 좋을 때든 나쁠 때든 흔들림 없이 ‘인플레이션은 반복된다’는 굳건한 믿음을 갖고 꾸준히 투자하는 사람만이 결국 부자가 될 수 있다. 자본주의 시스템이 지속되는 한 실물자산의 가격은 계속 오를 것. 일시적인 하락을 기다리거나, 폭락을 두려워할 필요가 없다. 인플레이션이 재테크에 주는 영향을 빨리 이해하고 빨리 시작하는 사람만이 조금 더 빨리 부를 이룰 것이다.

1장 인플레이션을 빨리 이해할수록 빨리 부자가 된다

기본소득은 과연 가능할까. 인공지능과 로봇이 인간의 노동력을 대체할 미래에는 기본소득으로 불평등과 빈곤문제를 해결할 것으로 전망하는 실정이다. 제도의 취지나 당위로는 더할 나위가 없다. 관건은 재원 마련이다. 막대한 돈이 드는 기본소득을 현실로 옮길 수 있을까. 이 책 『모두의 기본소득, 재원을 마련하다』의 저자들은 “기본소득 지급도, 재원조달도 모두 가능하다”고 입을 모은다.

기본소득 재원 마련의 철학적 기초는 ‘공유부’에 있다. 토지, 환경, 지식, 데이터 등 모두에게 속한 공유부의 수익을 평등하게 나눈다는 것이다. 이 책은 기본소득으로 지급할 수 있는 재원으로서, 공유부에 근거해 정당성을 획득한 모든 방안을 다룬다.

기본소득 금액을 먼저 정하고 이에 부합하는 재정모델을 설정한 다음 지급 방안을 마련하는 접근과는 다르다. 조달 가능한 재원을 최대한으로 모색하고 그 규모를 추계해 제시하는 방식이다. 실현가능한 재원조달 방안들과 조달액 추계 범위 내에서 상황에 따라 단계별로 취할 수 있는 조합을 모색하는 데 도움이 된다.

자바스크립트는 이제 브라우저를 넘어 웹 애플리케이션뿐만 아니라 마이크로 컨트롤러까지 점점 사용하는 곳이 늘어나고 있다. 이 책은 이런 변화의 흐름에서 주도적인 개발자로 성장하기 위해 웹 프런트엔드 프레임워크 및 라이브러리를 수동적으로 이용하는 것이 아니라 좀 더 깊이 있게 이해하고 사용하며, 더 나아가 웹 프런트엔드 프레임워크 및 라이브러리를 스스로 개발할 수 있는 역량을 가지게 한다. 그러기 위해서는 이 책을 통해 반드시 바닐라 자바스크립트, 즉 순수 자바스크립트를 익혀야 한다.

현재 뜨겁게 논쟁이 일고 있는 메타버스에 대한 전반적인 이해를 넘어서 산업 생태계, 관리, 경제학, 기반시설 등 여러 각도에서 생각해 봐야 할 관점을 보여 준다. 저자들은 과거 디지털 경제를 연구하면서 깨달은 바에 과학 기술 분야의 가장 놀랄 만한 변혁을 결합해 향후 발전 방향의 윤곽을 정리했다.

문제는 인류가 앞으로 살아갈 이 디지털 신세계에서는 과거 전통 경제에서 당연하다고 여겨졌던 기본 원칙들이 모두 통하지 않는다는 것이다. 더구나 이 책의 서문을 쓴 이더리움의 창시자 비탈릭 부테린은 메타버스의 디지털 자산 규모가 머지않아 현실 세계의 자산 규모를 넘어설 것이라고 예언한다.

메타버스는 단순한 경제가 아니라 ‘사회’이며 더욱이 M세대(메타버스 세대)가 만든 포스트모던 사회다. 메타버스에는 경제 현상은 물론이고 문화 현상과 사회 현상도 있다. 국가, 민족, 지역, 시간의 경계를 초월한 이 사회는 어떤 문명을 만들어낼까? 이 책은 도래할 메타버스 시대를 준비하고 기회를 포착하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

블록체인이란 거래정보가 중앙 서버에 집중되지 않고, 네트워크의 여러 컴퓨터에 분산해서 저장되는 것을 말한다. 블록체인 기술에 주목하는 이유는 저렴한 비용으로 투명하고 안전한 전자금융거래가 가능해질 것이라는 기대감 때문이다. 비용 측면에서도 블록체인은 기술의 특성상 막대한 비용절감 효과를 기대할 수 있기에 금융권과 공공서비스 부문의 블록체인 도입은 더욱 활발해질 전망이다.

20세기 가장 위대한 경제학자, 케인스. 그는 경제 이론과 경제 정책에 있어 위대한 지적 혁명을 촉발시켰다. 이 책은 수학 방정식 등을 최소화하면서, 대학교 학부학생, 열린 마음을 가지고 있는 기존 강단 경제학자, 공무원 그리고 일반 경제인 등 다양한 계층의 독자 모두가 쉽게 케인스의 경제 사상을 이해할 수 있도록 설명하고 있다.

이 책은 케인스 이론의 핵심적인 개념들, 즉 시장경제에 있어서 불확실성, 균형의 의미, 화폐의 역할, 그리고 유효수요의 원칙을 설명함으로써, 이러한 핵심 개념을 철저히 무시하고 있는 기존 주류 경제학과 그 안에서의 자칭 케인지언들이 가지는 오류를 지적하고 있다.

또한 그에 비추어 현대 경제에 있어서 다양한 논쟁점들, 즉 고용과 실업의 문제, 재정과 금융 정책, 국제수지 문제 등에 대한 케인스적인 해결 방안을 시사하고 있다. 특히 그러한 논의들을 역사적 배경(베르사유조약부터 브레턴우즈 체제까지)과 연결시키고, 또한 케인스의 경제 이론이 현재의 유로존 문제에 어떤 해결점을 제시할 수 있는지도 검토한다.

지금 우리가 처한 세계를 이해하는 가장 적합한 키워드가 있다면 그것은 ‘불평등’이다. 토마 피케티는 지난 몇십 년 동안 전 세계적으로 소득과 부의 불평등이 증가했다고 말한다. 그의 책 『21세기 자본』이 촉발한 불평등이라는 주제는 경제뿐 아니라 정치, 사회적으로 경각심을 일으키고 커다란 영향을 끼쳤다. 

경제학자 이정우는 피케티의 첫 책과 함께 최근작 『자본과 이데올로기』와 여러 저명한 경제학자가 함께 쓴 『세계불평등보고서 2018』을 통해 피케티가 정확히 어떤 진단을 내리고 있는지 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 불평등 문제를 해소하기 위해 피케티가 제시한 사회국가, 누진소득세, 세계자본세 그리고 참여사회주의와 참여연방주의 등의 처방에 대해서도 살펴본다. 

저자가 피케티의 책을 안내하는 이유는 한국 사회의 불평등을 바로 보고, 그에 따른 대안을 제안하고자 하는 데 있다. 한국은 소득 불평등, 정규직과 비정규직의 양극화, 부동산으로 인한 자산 불평등이 유독 심각하다. 저자는 이 문제의 해결 없이는 한국 경제의 지속적인 발전과 선진국 진입은 어렵다고 말한다. 나아가 한국이 처한 현실을 냉정하게 드러내 보여주고, 더 나은 세상으로 바꿔나가기 위한 다양한 해법들을 제시하고 있다.

탄소중립을 넘어 수소에너지가 가져올 미래는 무엇이고 그 미래를 선점하기 위해 각국 정부와 기업들이 주력해야 할 의제는 무엇인지, 이를 위해 각 분야의 전문가들이 주력해야 할 과제는 무엇인지 차근차근 짚어준다. 2050년 탄소중립, 에너지 안보 및 산업경쟁력 유지를 위한 해결책으로 수소의 가능성을 재확인할 기회가 될 것이며, 수소경제 관련 기초지식 습득을 원하는 사람들과 수소 관련 사업을 추진하면서 최신 기술 동향과 정보가 필요한 사업가들에게 도움이 될 수 있도록 집필됐다.

책은 총 8장으로 구성됐으며, 수소에너지란 무엇인가, 왜 수소가 미래 에너지로서 주목받고 있는지 등 수소에 관한 이야기로 시작해 수소경제에 관한 우리나라의 수소경제 활성화 전략과 2050 탄소중립 전략에 관해 설명한다. 또한 앞으로 우리가 해결해야 할 과제기 무엇인지도 이야기한다.

아울러 국내외 수소경제 정책 동향과 글로벌 석유기업들의 대응 전략 및 천연가스와 블루수소, 신재생에너지와 그린수소 등 수소의 종류와 각 특징에 따른 생산방법도 자세히 다루고 있다. 수소의 생산, 저 장·운송 및 활용과 관련된 기술과 국내외 사업 동향도 더불어 소개하며, 끝으로 수소의 가치사슬(Value Chain) 전반에 걸친 단가와 해외 수소의 도입 현황에 대해서도 다룬다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 ‘테라 인코그니타: 공존을 위한 새로운 시대정신을 찾아’를 아젠다로 제안했다. 한 번도 가보지 않은 새로운 세계는 우리에게 기회가 될 수도, 위협이 될 수도 있다. 하지만 정치.경제.학술.문화 등 각 분야의 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 통해 미래를 예측하고 준비할 수 있다면, 위협 또한 기회로 바꿀 수 있을 것이다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 현재 우리가 직면한 문제를 ‘정치 변화의 역학 Global Power Dynamics’, ‘비즈니스의 새 정의 New Business Path’, ‘부의 탐색 Wealth Discovery’, ‘넷제로 레이스 Race to Net-zero’, ‘비욘드 그래비티 Beyond Gravity’, ‘새로운 세계로의 입문 Hello, New World’ 등 6개의 대주제로 정하고 이에 대한 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 들었다.

전자공학과 소프트웨어에 대한 비전공자들도 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 기초적인 파이썬 언어에 대한 내용과 리눅스 기초 명령어들을 습득하고 라즈베리파이 4 실제 보드에서 파이썬을 이용해서 간단한 센서들의 동작 원리를 바로 실습해 볼 수 있도록 하였다. 파이썬 언어 전용으로 집필되었기 때문에 프로그램 언어의 초보자들도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있고, 센서 실습도 복잡한 부품과 브레드보드(일명 빵판)를 사용하지 않고 센서 HAT보드에 연결만 하면 바로 실습이 가능하기 때문에 전자공학 비전문가들도 간단하게 따라 하기가 가능하다. 특히 최근 온라인 비대면 수업을 할 때 배선 오류에 대한 부담감을 줄일 수 있다.

TensorFlow와 sklearn을 사용해 금융이나 경제 맥락에 인공지능을 접목하는 방법론을 설명한다. 먼저 경제학이 추구하는 지향점과 머신러닝의 특징과 장점을 비교해 같은 점과 다른 점을 분석한 다음 양 측면에서 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 방대한 참고문헌과 함께 설명한다. 기초적인 회귀에서 출발해 결정 트리와 랜덤 포레스트를 살펴보고 이미지 처리와 자연어 처리가 금융 맥락에서 어떻게 활발하게 활용되고 있는지 설명한다. 특히 자연어 처리 부분이 금융 맥락과 접목되는 지점은 다양한 실습과 예제를 통해 손쉽게 이해하도록 돕는다.

금융 데이터의 특징인 시계열 데이터는 RNN과 LSTM를 활용해 설명한다. 또한 생성적 모델을 적용하는 방법과 이론적 모델 부분도 다룬다. 각 장은 모두 예제와 코드를 지원하며 이를 통해 각 상황을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 기초를 제공한다. 책에서 제공하는 방대한 참고문헌은 금융 맥락에서 인공지능을 접목하려던 수많은 학자의 발자취를 살펴볼 귀중한 자료다.
