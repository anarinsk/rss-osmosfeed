                    <span>This paper studies the public debt implications of a class of Aiyagari (1994)-Bewley (1977)-Huggett (1993) (ABH) models of incomplete insurance in which agents face a near-zero probability of a highly adverse outcome. In generic models of this kind, there exists a public debt bubble, so that the government is able to borrow at a real interest rate that is perpetually below the economic growth rate. Given an equilibrium with a public debt bubble, the primary deficit and the level of debt are both strictly increasing in the real interest rate and in the fraction of government expenditures used for lumpsum transfers. There is no upper bound on the deficit level or long-run debt level that is sustainable in equilibrium. In a public debt bubble, regardless of its size, agents are better off in the long run if the government chooses policies that give rise to a larger debt and primary deficit.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents an analysis of what types of values, especially in regards to obedience vs. independence, families impart to their children and how these values interact with social mobility. In the model, obedience is a useful characteristic for employers, especially when wages are low, because independent workers require more incentives (when wages are high, these incentives are automatic). Hence, in low-wage environments, low-income families will impart values of obedience to their children to prevent disadvantaging them in the labor market. To the extent that independence is useful for entrepreneurial activities, this then depresses their social mobility. High-income and privileged parents, on the other hand, always impart values of independence, since they expect that their children can enter into higher-income entrepreneurial (or managerial) activities thanks to their family resources and privileges. I also discuss how political activity can be hampered when labor market incentives encourage greater obedience and how this can generate multiple steady states with different patterns of social hierarchy and mobility.</span>

                    <span>We develop a dynamic competitive equilibrium model of battery adoption and operations to evaluate the social value and adoption trajectory of utility-scale batteries and examine policy counterfactuals. The first battery unit breaks even in 2027 when renewable energy share reaches 52% and expected capital costs are $259/kWh.  While the competitive market will install 10 MWh by 2030, competitive adoption does not reach 5,000 MWh until 2043 because the marginal value of investment sharply declines in aggregate capacity. California&#x27;s 1,300 MW battery mandate implies subsidies of 49% and creates deadweight losses of $433 million relative to a competitive battery market.</span>

                    <span>With “2020 hindsight,” the 2000s housing cycle is not a boom-bust but rather a boom- bust-rebound at both the national level and across cities. We argue this pattern reflects a larger role for fundamentally-rooted explanations than previously thought. We construct a city-level long-run fundamental using a spatial equilibrium regression framework in which house prices are determined by local income, amenities, and supply. The fundamental predicts not only 1997-2019 price and rent growth but also the amplitude of the boom-bust-rebound and foreclosures. This evidence motivates our neo-Kindlebergerian model, in which an improvement in fundamentals triggers a boom-bust-rebound. Agents learn about the fundamentals by observing “dividends” but become over-optimistic due to diagnostic expectations. A bust ensues when over-optimistic beliefs start to correct, exacerbated by a price-foreclosure spiral that drives prices below their long-run level. The rebound follows as prices converge to a path commensurate with higher fundamental growth. The estimated model explains the boom-bust-rebound with a single fundamental shock and accounts quantitatively for cross-city patterns in the dynamics of prices and foreclosures.</span>

                    <span>Governments around the world have gone on a massive fiscal expansion in response to the Covid crisis, increasing government debt to levels not seen in 75 years. How will this debt be repaid? What role do conventional and unconventional monetary policy play? We investigate debt sustainability in a New Keynesian model with an intermediary sector, realistic fiscal and monetary policy, endogenous convenience yields, and substantial risk premia. When conventional monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB during an economic crisis, increased government spending and lower tax revenue lead to a large rise in government debt and raise the risk of future tax increases. We find that quantitative easing (QE), forward guidance, and an expansion in government discretionary spending all contribute to lowering debt/GDP ratio and reducing this fiscal risk. A transitory QE policy deployed during a crisis stimulates aggregate demand.</span>

                    <span>We address the question of how sensitive is the power of fiscal policy in the ZLB to the assumption of rational expectations. We do so through the lens of a standard NK model in which people are level-k thinkers. Our analysis weakens the case for using government spending to stabilize the economy when the ZLB binds. The less sophis- ticated people are, the smaller is the size of the government-spending multiplier. Our analysis strengthens the case for using tax policy to stabilize output when the ZLB is binding. The power of tax policy to stabilize the economy during the ZLB period is essentially undiminished when agents do not have rational expectations. Finally, we show that the way in which tax policy is communicated is critical to its effectiveness.</span>

They identify regulatory risk as the top climate risk to businesses and investors over the next five years, but they view physical risks as the top risk over the next 30 years. By an overwhelming margin, respondents believe that asset prices underestimate climate risks. We also tabulate opinions about the correlation between growth and climate change; social discount rates appropriate for projects that mitigate the effects of climate change; most influential forces for reducing climate risks; and, most important research topics.</span>

                    <span>After receiving FDA approval, a generic drug manufacturer can launch “at risk” before conclusion of any patent infringement litigation, but it risks paying damages if it loses.  The generic can eliminate the risk by waiting to launch until the appeals process is complete but waiting has downsides too.  We develop a model that implies that, after the generic has won a district court decision, at-risk entry is generally profitable and will occur quickly unless the cost of waiting for the appeal is very low.  We examine generic drug applications that have received FDA approval with “first-filer” status (which precludes later filing generics from entering before the first filer).  In our data, the generic and brand usually settled prior to the conclusion of litigation.  For the remainder, drugs that received FDA approval prior to a favorable district court decision were always launched at risk.  Generics without FDA approval before a favorable district court decision launched upon approval unless the approval was close in time to the appeal decision or it had forfeited the first filer exclusivity (indicating a low cost of waiting).  We also consider implications of at-risk entry for social welfare, arguing that at-risk entry is analogous to a “buy out” of the patent with favorable welfare implications in both the short run (consumer prices) and long run (efficient incentives for R&amp;D).</span>

                    <span>We investigate the relationship between opioid diverting policy and suicides among the veteran population.  The opioid epidemic of the past two decades has had devastating health consequences among U.S. veterans and military personnel. In 2013, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) implemented the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) with the goal of discouraging prescription opioid dependence among VA patients.  Between 2012 and 2017, prescription opioids dispensed by the VA fell 41% (VA, 2018). Because this involved the aggressive curtailing of opioid prescriptions for many VA patients, OSI may have had a detrimental effect on veterans’ mental health leading to suicide in extreme cases. In addition, because rural veterans have much higher rates of VA enrollment, more prescription opioid use and abuse, and lower rates of substance abuse and mental health treatment utilization, we expect any effect of OSI on veteran suicides to be concentrated in rural areas. We find that OSI raised the veteran suicide rate relative to the non-veteran (“civilian”) rate with rural veterans suffering the lion’s share of the increase. We estimate that OSI raised the rural veteran suicide rate by a little over one-third between 2013 and 2018.</span>

                    <span>We use a temporary ban on inter-province shipping of live hogs induced by the 2018 outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in China as a natural experiment to study spatial mechanisms behind the dynamics of market integration. With a unique dataset of weekly provincial hog prices, we employ a novel spatial network model to estimate the strength of price co-movement across provinces pre and post the ban. Results indicate that, in the highly integrated national market prior to the ban, longer geographical distances between two provinces did not weaken the strength of their price linkage. The ban broken down spatial integration. Longer distances became a significant obstacle to spatial price linkage in the post-ban periods, implying faster re-integration of hog prices between proximate provinces than remote ones. The negative effect of distance can be rationalized by the interplay between arbitrage opportunities and imperfect information. Our findings highlight information transparency as a key to market integration post shipping bans used to curb animal pandemics like ASF.</span>

                    <span>A large literature in cognitive science studies the puzzling &quot;Flynn effect&quot; of rising fluid intelligence (reasoning skill) in rich countries. We develop an economic model in which a cohort&#x27;s mix of skills is determined by different skills&#x27; relative returns in the labor market and by the technology for producing skills. We estimate the model using administrative data from Sweden. Combining data from exams taken at military enlistment with earnings records from the tax register, we document an increase in the relative labor market return to logical reasoning skill as compared to vocabulary knowledge. The estimated model implies that changes in labor market returns explain 36 percent of the measured increase in reasoning skill, and can also explain the decline in knowledge. An original survey of parents, an analysis of trends in school curricula, and an analysis of occupational characteristics show evidence of increasing emphasis on reasoning as compared to knowledge.</span>

We focus particularly on the I.O. models and empirical methods and analyses that researchers have formulated to address policy-relevant questions, although we also provide an overview of the institutional facts and findings that inform them. We divide the chapter into two broad sections: (i)  papers considering competition and price-setting among insurers and providers and (ii) papers focused specifically on insurance and market design. The former set of papers is largely concerned with models of oligopolistic competition; it is often focused on the US commercial insurance market where prices are market-determined rather than being set administratively. The latter focuses on insurance market design with an emphasis on issues raised by asymmetric information, leading to adverse selection and moral hazard. In addition, we discuss the literature on consumer choice frictions in this market and the significant implications of those frictions for I.O. questions.</span>

                    <span>This chapter investigates the non-market response of firms to international trade shocks increasing the level of competition in U.S. industries. Lobbying expenditures increase as a consequence of import changes related to the China shock. The effect on lobbying is not homogeneous across firms and it concentrates particularly in those producers which are behind the technological frontier. We discuss theoretical mechanisms driving lobbying of firms away from the technological frontier: not only the cost-benefit trade-off between innovation and lobbying is relatively less appealing for low productivity firms, but the collective action ability of low productivity firms improves after a competitive shock.</span>

Our model is based on a set point for BMI or bodyweight that is adapted to conditions of scarcity in the pre-modern economy, but which subsequently fails to adjust to rapid economic change. During the process of development, some individuals thus remain at their low-BMI set point, despite the increase in their consumption, while others who have escaped the nutrition trap (but are not necessarily overweight) are at increased risk of metabolic disease. The model and the underlying biological mechanism, which are validated with micro-data from India, Indonesia and Ghana can jointly explain inter-regional (Asia-Africa) differences in nutritional status and the prevalence of diabetes.</span>

                    <span>We study a model of retrospective search in which an agent—a researcher, an online shopper, or a politician—tracks the value of a product. Discoveries beget discoveries and their observations are correlated over time, which we model using a Brownian motion. The agent, a standard exponential discounter, decides the breadth and length of search. We fully characterize the optimal search policy. The optimal search scope is U-shaped, with the agent searching most ambitiously when approaching a breakthrough or when nearing search termination. A drawdown stopping boundary is optimal, where the agent ceases search whenever current observations fall a constant amount below the maximal achieved alternative. We also show special features that emerge from contracting with a retrospective searcher.</span>

                    <span>The nonrivalry of ideas gives rise to increasing returns, a fact celebrated in Paul Romer&#x27;s recent Nobel Prize. An implication is that the long-run rate of economic growth is the product of the degree of increasing returns and the growth rate of research effort; this is the essence of semi-endogenous growth theory. This paper interprets past and future growth from a semi-endogenous perspective. For 50+ years, U.S. growth has substantially exceeded its long-run rate because of rising educational attainment, declining misallocation, and rising (global) research intensity, implying that frontier growth could slow markedly in the future. Other forces push in the opposite direction. First is the prospect of &quot;finding new Einsteins&quot;: how many talented researchers have we missed historically because of the underdevelopment of China and India and because of barriers that discouraged women inventors? Second is the longer-term prospect that artificial intelligence could augment or even replace people as researchers. Throughout, the paper highlights many opportunities for further research.</span>

                    <span>Books shape how children learn about society and social norms, in part through the representation of different characters. To better understand the messages children encounter in books, we introduce new artificial intelligence methods for systematically converting images into data. We apply these image tools, along with established text analysis methods, to measure the representation of race, gender, and age in children’s books commonly found in US schools and homes over the last century. We find that more characters with darker skin color appear over time, but &quot;mainstream&quot; award-winning books, which are twice as likely to be checked out from libraries, persistently depict more lighter-skinned characters even after conditioning on perceived race. Across all books, children are depicted with lighter skin than adults. Over time, females are increasingly present but are more represented in images than in text, suggesting greater symbolic inclusion in pictures than substantive inclusion in stories. Relative to their growing share of the US population, Black and Latinx people are underrepresented in the mainstream collection; males, particularly White males, are persistently overrepresented. Our data provide a view into the &quot;black box&quot; of education through children’s books in US schools and homes, highlighting what has changed and what has endured.</span>

                    <span>We study the growth of Chinese imports into the United States from autarky during 1950-1970 to about 15 percent of overall imports in 2008, taking advantage of the rich heterogeneity in trade policy and trade growth across products during this period. Central to our analysis is an accounting for the dynamics of trade, trade policy, and trade-policy expectations. We isolate the lagged effects of past reforms and the current effects of uncertainty about future reforms. We build a multi-industry, heterogeneous-firm model with a dynamic export participation decision to estimate a path of trade-policy expectations. We find that being granted Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status in 1980 was largely a surprise and that, in the early stages, this reform had a high probability of being reversed. The likelihood of reversal dropped considerably during the mid 1980s, and, despite China&#x27;s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, changed little throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, although uncertainty depressed trade substantially following the 1980 liberalization, much of the trade growth that followed China&#x27;s WTO accession was a delayed response to previous reforms rather than a response to declining uncertainty.</span>

                    <span>Four million Native Americans who identify as single race live in the USA.  Another three million identify as Native American in combination with another race.  Yet they are rarely the focus of detailed research.  We provide the first evidence that levels of consistently poor mental health, or chronic distress, among Native peoples were greater in every year between 1993 and 2020 than among White or Black Americans.  We find this to be present among those over the age of thirty but less so for the young.  Over time we demonstrate there has been a rise in chronic distress among Native Americans and multi-race individuals.  However, chronic distress seems to be lowest among Native peoples living in the seven states with the largest Native American populations of Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Oklahoma.  In our judgment these facts are important and not widely known.  This stands in stark contrast to the enormous scholarly and media interest in declining physiological well-being among White Americans.</span>

                    <span>Electrification of transportation and buildings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions requires massive switching from natural gas and refined petroleum products. All three end-use energy sources are mispriced due in part to the unpriced pollution they emit. Natural gas and electricity utilities also face the classic natural monopoly challenge of recovering fixed costs while maintaining efficient pricing. We study the magnitude of these distortions for electricity, natural gas, and gasoline purchased by residential customers across the continental US. We find that the net distortion in pricing electricity is much greater than for natural gas or gasoline. In most of the country, residential electricity prices are well above social marginal cost (SMC, private marginal cost plus unpriced externalities), while in some areas with large shares of coal-fired generation, prices are below SMC.  Combining our estimates of marginal price and SMC for each of the fuels with a large survey of California households&#x27; energy use, we calculate the distribution of annual fuel costs for space heating, water heating, and electric vehicles under actual pricing versus setting price at SMC.  We find that moving prices for all three fuels to equal their SMC would significantly increase the incentive for Californians to switch to electricity for these energy services</span>

                    <span>Treasury yields spiked during the initial phase of COVID. The 10-year yield increased by 64 bps from March 9 to 18, 2020, leading the Federal Reserve to purchase $1T of Treasuries in 2020Q1. Fed purchases were causal for reducing Treasury yields based on the timing of purchases (which increased on March 19), the timing of yield reversal and Fed purchases in the MBS market, and evidence against confounding factors. Treasury-QE worked more via purchases than announcements. The yield spike was driven by liquidity needs of mutual funds, foreign official agencies, and hedge funds that were unaffected by the March 15 Treasury-QE announcement.</span>

                    <span>This paper uses new administrative data with detailed borrower information and lengthy repayment histories from the Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP) to measure rates of return on undergraduate student loans. We document substantial heterogeneity in returns based on information available at the time loans were disbursed, including province of residence, field of study, and institution of attendance. Field of study is a particularly important determinant of rates of return, explaining 22% of the variation in predicted returns across borrowers.  We explore the implications of this variation for CSLP cross-subsidization across borrowers and potential risk-based loan limits. Given the variation in ex ante predicted returns across borrowers, using all available information at the time of loan disbursement, we study the implications of potential cream-skimming of high-return borrowers by private lenders.</span>

                    <span>In the single-IV model, researchers commonly rely on t-ratio-based inference, even though the literature has quantified its potentially severe large-sample distortions. Building on the approach for correcting inference of Stock and Yogo (2005), we introduce the tF critical value function, leading to a minimized standard error adjustment factor that is a smooth function of the first-stage F-statistic. Applying the correction to a sample of 61 AER papers leads to a 25 percent increase in standard errors, on average. tF confidence intervals have shorter expected length than those of Anderson and Rubin (1949), whenever both are bounded intervals.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it. Yet, there is little evidence on the impacts of these policies on women, who are likely to be especially vulnerable, in lower-income countries. We conduct a large phone survey and leverage India&#x27;s geographically-varying containment policies to estimate the association between both the pandemic and its containment policies, and measures of women&#x27;s well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases, we find that greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and with reduced female mental health. Average containment levels are associated with a 39-40% increase in the likelihood of sadness, depression, and hopelessness among women and with an increase in the likelihood that women feel more worried by 45% of the variable mean. Particularly vulnerable groups of women, those with daughters and those living in female-headed households, experience larger declines in mental health.</span>

                    <span>Does the offshoring of production degrade or enhance the innovative capabilities of manufacturing firms? We contribute to this debate by exploiting a policy shock that differentially affected the ability of Taiwanese firms to offshore some products to China. We find causal evidence that offshoring impacts both the level and nature of innovation. In the technologies directly related to product categories that could be offshored more easily after the policy shock, overall innovation levels decline and innovative effort shifts away from product innovation and towards process innovation. However, we also find evidence of a second-order positive effect of offshoring on the levels of innovation—particularly product innovation—in other parts of the firm’s portfolio. These results are consistent with the notion that offshoring production induces a complex reallocation of innovation effort within the firm, both across and within technology categories.  Our paper examines this reallocation in the context of Taiwanese electronics firms, and introduces new methods that could be used to study post-offshoring reallocations of innovative effort in other contexts.</span>

Providing cash incentives to the caretaker and a one-time facility upgrade improved the quality of facilities and reduced free riding, but pushed more residents to practise open defecation, with poor public health outcomes.

                    <span>From Dodge Data Analytics: Dodge Momentum Index Pulls Back in July
The Dodge Momentum Index fell to 155.8 (2000&#x3D;100) in July, a 6% decline from the revised June reading of 164.9. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Data &amp; Analytics, is a monthly measure of the first (or initial) report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year.
  
Both components of the Momentum Index fell in July. Commercial planning fell 3%, while institutional planning dropped 9%.
  
The Momentum Index posted strong gains through much of the winter and spring as the economy and building markets began to stabilize following the recession. While the economy has continued its forward progress through the summer, the Index has regressed somewhat as higher material prices and shortages of skilled labor continue to exert a strong influence over the construction sector. Despite the declines in June and July, the Momentum Index remains near levels last seen in 2018. Compared to a year earlier, the Momentum Index was 25% higher than in July 2020 — institutional planning was up 27% and commercial planning was 25% higher than last year.

This graph shows the Dodge Momentum Index since 2002. The index was at 155.8 in June, down from 164.9 in June.
According to Dodge, this index leads &quot;construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year&quot;.  This index suggests a decline in Commercial Real Estate construction through most of 2021, but a pickup towards the end of the year, and growth in 2022 (even with the decline in the July index).</span>

                    <span>In a policy reversal, the US has announced its support for a proposed temporary waiver of intellectual property rights on COVID-19-related pharmaceuticals, although it is unclear how much of the undisclosed information regarding unpatented elements would be disclosed in order to facilitate technology transfer to developing countries. This column argues that most efficient way to achieve equitable vaccine access would be to concentrate production in a smaller number of countries with sufficient production capacity. It also looks at the implications for Japan, which is caught in a dilemma between the need to vaccinate the population quickly and the need to secure incentives for developing domestic vaccine capacity for future pandemics.</span>

This column uses a new framework where firms can adopt intermediate-intensive technologies to study the relationship between globalisation and specialisation, and its implications for the labour share and income. It finds that an expansion in market size such as that resulting from globalisation increases production specialisation, decreases labour cost shares, and increases profit concentration.</span>

U.S. rail traffic in July 2021 was up over July 2020, but for most commodity categories the  percentage increase was significantly lower than in other recent months, both because of more difficult  comparisons and because various external factors have led to a recent deceleration in rail volumes. In July, total U.S. carloads were up 6.6% over July 2020 and down 13.3% from July 2019.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
U.S. railroads originated 904,670 total carloads in July 2021, up 6.6% over July 2020 and down 13.3% from  July 2019. The 6.6% is the smallest year-over-year gain for total carloads in four months. Total carloads  averaged 226,168 per week in July 2021, which is the  smallest weekly average for any month since February  2021 and the smallest weekly average for July — other  than July 2020 — since our records begin in 1988.
The second graph shows the six week average (not monthly) of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
U.S. intermodal originations were up 1.5% in July  2021 over July 2020 but were down 1.9% from July 2019.  ...

As of August 3, 1.82 million homeowners remain in COVID-19-related forbearance plans, representing 3.4% of all active mortgages, including 2.0% of GSE, 6.0% of FHA/VA and 4.2% of loans held in bank portfolio and private securitizations.
  
Improvement was seen across the board. FHA/VA saw the greatest reduction with a …</span>

                    <span>The headline jobs number in the July employment report was slightly above expectations, and employment for the previous two months was revised up significantly.   The participation rate increased slightly and the unemployment rate decreased sharply to 5.4%.

Leisure and hospitality gained 380 thousand jobs.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 1.7 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back almost 79% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.


Construction employment increased 11 thousand in June, and manufacturing added 27 thousand jobs.


NOTE: State and Local education added 231 thousand jobs, seasonally adjusted.  But this is a seasonal quirk - there were actually 962 thousand education jobs l…</span>

                    <span>From the BLS: 
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 943,000 in July, and the unemployment rate  declined by 0.5 percentage point to 5.4 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in local government education, and in professional and business services. 
...
The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised up by 31,000, from +583,000 to +614,000, and the change for June was revised up by 88,000, from +850,000 to +938,000. With these revisions, employment in May and June combined is 119,000 higher  than previously reported.

Click on graph for larger image.
The first graph shows the year-over-year change in total non-farm employment since 1968.
In July, the year-over-year change was 7.255 million jobs.  This was up significantly year-over-year.
Total payrolls increased by 943 thousand in July.  Private payrolls increased by 703 thousand.
Payrolls for May and June were revised up 119 thousand, combined.
The second graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession, in percentage terms.
The current employment recession was by far the worst recession since WWII in percentage terms, but currently is not as severe as the worst of the &quot;Great Recession&quot;.
The third graph shows the employment population ratio and the participation rate.
The Labor Force Participation Rate increased to 61.7% in June, from 61.6% in June. This is the percentage of the working age population in the labor force. 
The Employment-Population ratio increased to 58.4% from 58.0% (black line).
I&#x27;ll post the 25 to 54 age group employment-population ratio graph later.
The fourth graph shows the unemployment rate.  
The unemployment rate decreased in July to 5.4% from 5.9% in June. 
This was slightly above consensus expectations, and May and June were revised up by 119,000 combined.

《밑바닥부터 만드는 인터프리터 in Go》의 후속편. 인터프리터와 컴파일러의 가장 큰 차이점은 중간코드, 즉 목적코드의 존재 유무에 있다. 전편처럼 테스트 주도 개발 방법을 이용해, 컴파일러의 작은 부품에서부터 시작하여 점차 고급 기능으로 확장해간다. 

이런 전개의 장점은 컴파일러의 구조와 코드를 독자가 매우 쉽게 이해하게 된다는 점입니다. 레고 부품을 조립해 하나의 완성된 테마를 만들 때처럼, 구현물이 테스트를 통과할 때마다 컴파일러의 동작 원리를 깨치는 재미가 제법 쏠쏠하다.

드래곤북 류의 방대한 이론을 담은 책도, 50줄의 코드로 장난감 같은 인터프리터를 뚝딱 만드는 블로그 수준의 글을 모아놓은 책도 아니다. 저자는 그 중간 어느 지점에서 이론보다는 구현을, 여러 기능의 나열보다는 인터프리터를 제대로 이해하기 위한 본질적이면서 교육적인 기능에 초점을 맞추어 책을 집필하였다.

                    <span>Remember when your local newspaper was filled with classified advertising? Once, three-line ads for lonely hearts and used cars for sale were a guaranteed source of revenue. Then Craigslist replaced classifieds in the US, and the result, Ruben Durante tells Tim Phillips, has been less political reporting and more partisan polarisation.

                    <span>As of June 2021, the US labour-force participation rate had not yet recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels. This column explores how much the aggregate decline in employment between 2020 and 2021 can be explained by excess job loss among parents, and particularly mothers, of young children, who have had to contend with school and daycare closures during the pandemic. The findings suggest that excessive employment declines among parents do not explain a sizeable share of ongoing job loss. A larger decline in employment for parents of young children was seen only among women without a bachelor’s degree.</span>

                    <span>A few brief excerpts from a note by Goldman Sachs economist Spencer Hill:
We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 1,150k in July ... Labor supply constraints eased further due to the wind-down of federal unemployment top-ups in some states and the addition of over 2 million youth job seekers in June and July. ... We estimate a 0.4pp drop in the unemployment rate to 5.5% (vs. consensus 5.7%), reflecting a strong household employment gain offset by a sizable rise in the participation rate.
emphasis added
CR Note: The consensus is for 900 thousand jobs added, and for the unemployment rate to decrease to 5.7%.</span>

                    <span>The Northwest Multiple Listing Service reported Home buyers are finding some relief, but Northwest MLS brokers say it is temporary
Competition for homes eased slightly in July across much of Washington state, but brokers from Northwest Multiple Listing Service expect the respite to be short-lived, with inventory still tight and prices still climbing.
&quot;Although the local market is intense, buyers can find some relief because there aren&#x27;t as many offers to compete with compared to earlier this year,&quot; observed J. Lennox Scott, chairman and CEO of John L. Scott Real Estate. He noted the number of listings brokers added last month outgained the number of homes going under contract by a small margin in most areas in the report.
...
At month end, there were 7,948 total listings offered for sale, down 22.5% from the year-ago total of 10,259. That was the highest level since October when inventory totaled 8,623 properties, including single family homes and condominiums.
emphasis added
The press release is for the Northwest MLS area.  There were 10,919 closed sales in July 2021, up 11.0% from 9,840 sales in July 2020.  Active inventory for the Northwest is down 22.5%.
In King County, sales were up 18.4% year-over-year, and active inventory was down 30.9% year-over-year.
In Seattle, sales were up 27.8% year-over-year, and inventory was down 22.7% year-over-year.  This puts the months-of-supply in Seattle at just 0.93 months.

Note that inventory in the Northwest was up 25% from last month (June 2021), and up 44% from May 2021.</span>

                    <span>Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 6.2% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Occupancy Down, But Rates Increase From Prior Week
U.S. weekly hotel occupancy dipped from the previous week, while room rates were up slightly, according to STR‘s latest data through July 31.
July 25-31, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 70.1% (-6.2%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $142.76 (+6.8%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $100.07 (+0.1%)
 ADR remained at an all-time high on a nominal basis but not when adjusted for inflation ($135).
...
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn&#x27;t start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months have had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.</span>

사상 최악의 주가 폭락은 과연 코로나 팬데믹 탓인가? 그렇지 않다. 이미 주가가 최대치로 부풀어 올랐기 때문에 터진 것일 뿐이다. 버블의 진리. 한껏 부풀어오르면 그다음에는 터질 일만 남는다. 코로나는 계기일 뿐이었다. 그런데 각국 정부는 다시금 양적 완화로 경제위기를 틀어막았다. 그로 인해 또 다른 버블이 생겼다. 이제 막다른 길이 코앞에 다가왔다. 코로나 이후 우리는 어떻게 해야 할까? 

일본 경제학계의 대표 석학이자 행동파 경제학자인 오바타 세키 교수는 코로나 이후 혼란스러운 경제상황을 냉정히 분석하고 앞으로의 변화를 날카롭게 예측한다. 아무도 경험하지 못한 &#x27;애프터 코로나&#x27;의 세계는 어떻게 변화해 갈까? 앞으로 세계경제는 성장할까, 아니면 버블의 최종 국면으로 터져버리고 말까?
 
저자는 근대 자본주의가 연명할 수 있을지, 정부와 개인이 더 나은 세상을 위해 무엇을 해야 하는지 놀랍도록 직관적인 통찰과 대담한 솔루션을 제시한다. 저자의 통찰을 따라가다 보면 일본 경제를 넘어 &#x27;포스트 코로나&#x27; 시대 세계 경제가 나아갈 방향을 알려주는 이정표를 만날 수 있을 것이다.

                    <span>Monetary policy has fiscal implications since its effect on interest rates, inflation and output relaxes or tightens the general government inter-temporal budget constraint. Inflation dynamics is the result of both monetary policy and the fiscal response to it via the adjustment of the primary deficit. This column discusses estimates of the fiscal responses to monetary policy in the euro area. It shows that the more modest impact of unconventional monetary policy easing on inflation, if compared with the impact of conventional easing, can be explained by a more modest increase in the primary deficit in the former case.</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has forced firms to adapt their work processes to the infectious dynamic and the public health measures to contain it. Using survey data of almost 2,000 establishments in Germany, this column shows that the pandemic has accelerated the diffusion of digital technologies, especially in combination with working from home. Investments are particularly prominent in large establishments, while small and medium-sized establishments are less likely to invest in digital technologies and more likely to face financial or logistic barriers to investment. Investments vary a lot across sectors, but are less influenced by the current economic condition of the establishment.</span>

                    <span>Sales slumped in April and May 2020, so the year-over-year (YoY) increases were large for April and May this year.   However, starting in June 2020, sales increased sharply, so sales are now down YoY.

Note: I&#x27;m tracking data for many local markets around the U.S.  I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.

From the DMAR: Monthly Indicators, July 2021


Total Residential Units Sold in July 2021 were 5,820, down 21.3% from 7,398 in July 2020.


Active Residential Listings in June 2021 were 4,056, up 29.9% from 3,122 last month, but down 37.1% from 6,449 in July 2020.
 

Inventory in Denver had been fairly steady over the last 6 or 7 years, but declined sharply in 2020.  Even with the recent sharp month-to-month increases, this is still the lowest level of inventory for July on record.


From DMAR: DMAR Real Estate Market Trends Report | AUG. &#x27;21
While still in a robust seller&#x27;s market, the July 2021 report indicates that as we head into fall, buyers will start to have more time to review properties and less competition on the number of offers overall. The July residential real estate market reported an increased inventory of 29.92 percent, while it also represented a decrease in closings of 12.30 percent compared to the previous month, indicating a supply increase and demand decrease.
  
“The real estate market continuously changes,” said Andrew Abrams, Chair of the DMAR Market Trends Committee and Metro Denver REALTOR®. “It appears that, for now, we are back to drawing within the lines. For buyers, this can be beneficial by having more normal expectations of what it takes to buy. For sellers with grandiose dreams of what their house could be worth, now is the time to come back to reality and use the data to help make an educated decision.” 
emphasis added
Active inventory in Denver is up 111% from the record low in March 2021.</span>

                    <span>The BEA released their estimate of light vehicle sales for July this morning.  The BEA estimates sales of 14.75 million SAAR in July 2021 (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate), down 4.1% from the June sales rate, and up 0.3% from July 2020. 

This was well below the consensus estimate of 15.7 million SAAR.

This graph shows light vehicle sales since 2006 from the BEA (blue) and the BEA&#x27;s estimate for July (red).
The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
After April 2020, sales increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic).  


However, sales have decreased recently due to supply issues.


Sales-to-date are down 2.4% compared to the same period in 2019.

The second graph shows light vehicle sales since the BEA started keeping data in 1967.
Note: dashed line is current estimated sales rate of 14.75 million SAAR.</span>

부동산 중개업 시장에서 최고 난이도는 빌딩 시장이다. 그만큼 누구나 하고 싶어 하지만 아무나 도전할 수 없는 영역이기도 하다. 현재 주택에 대한 대출이 막혔고, 다주택자 및 고급주택에 대한 고세율 부가정책 등 주택을 투자재로서 매력을 잃게 만든 여러 규제로 인해 꼬마빌딩 투자 시장이 화두가 되고 있다. 이처럼 경기불황 속 빌딩매매에 대한 관심은 꾸준히 이어질 것으로 예상된다. 

이 책에서는 주택이 없는 근린생활시설 꼬마빌딩의 매매에 관해 다루었다. 빌딩 매입 사전지식부터 필수 실무지식을 거쳐 구매 이후 관리까지 건물 투자와 관련한 저자만의 실전 경험과 지식 노하우를 아낌없이 담았다. 학군, 교통, 편의시설, 집값을 주도하는 서울 강남구 지역을 전격 분석했으며, 책 속 지도에는 QR코드를 삽입하여 해당 위치를 그 자리에서 바로 살펴볼 수 있다. 부동산 전문가의 시선에서 바라본 빌딩매매 시장을 디테일하게 분석하여 ‘전문성’도 살렸다. 부디 부동산 재테크에 뛰어든 초보 투자자들에게 이해하기 쉽고 술술 읽히는 책이 되길 바란다.

                    <span>Traditional theories emphasise production decisions and the commuting costs of workers in shaping the spatial concentration of economic activity in cities. However, much of urban travel is related to consumption of non-traded services, such as trips to restaurants, shopping centres, and cultural venues. This column looks at commuting and non-commuting trips within the Greater Tokyo metropolitan area to explore how consumption access can explain the observed spatial variation in economic activity. Access to consumption opportunities and to employment opportunities both matter; focusing solely on commuting trips provides a misleading picture of travel patterns.</span>

fastai 라이브러리는 딥러닝 응용에 일관된 인터페이스를 최초로 제공하며 &#x27;모두를 위한 딥러닝&#x27;을 가능하게 한다. 이제 더 이상 딥러닝은 구글, 페이스북, 마이크로소프트 등 거대 기술 기업의 전유물이 아니다. 파이썬에 친숙한 프로그래머라면 약간의 수학적 배경지식, 소규모 데이터, 짧은 코드만으로도 딥러닝을 구현하는 놀라운 경험을 얻을 수 있다. 이 책에서 fastai 라이브러리의 창시자인 제러미와 실뱅은 fastai와 파이토치로 다양한 작업에 대한 모델을 학습시키는 방법을 소개한다. 또한 내부적인 알고리즘을 완전히 이해하는 데 필요한 딥러닝 이론도 설명한다.

신(新)중국 성립부터 지금까지의 중국 국가발전전략과 규획의 수립 및 실행적 과정을 돌이켜 보며, 국제적인 시각과 시대의 변화에 끊임없이 동조하는 자세로 그 중의 경험과 교훈에 대하여 평가와 총결을 진행하는 책이다. 국가발전전략의 분석 방면에서 저자는 전략적 패러다임 및 유파의 개념을 제시하였고, 이를 근거로 중국과 외국의 전략 유형에 대해 이론적 귀납을 진행하였으며 새로운 시대적 관점에서 앞으로의 중국 국가발전전략의 선택 및 방향을 분석하였다.

국가발전규획의 분석 방면에서 저자는 규획의 변천, 경험과 규획의 실행 과정에서 존재하는 문제를 실마리로 삼아 어떻게 국가규획사업의 품질을 제고하고, 규획체계를 완비할 것인지에 대해 연구하였는데 구체적으로 국가의 총체적 규획의 개선, 지역 규획의 완비와 그에 따른 기타 규획과의 관계, 시?현급(市縣級) 규획체제의 개혁, 주체기능구역 규획의 완비 및 규획의 법제화 등이다.

자본주의와 산업화의 역사를 꼼꼼히 살펴본다. 또한 이 현대문명의 사상적 · 기술적 기초가 된 다양한 철학자들과 과학자들의 영향과 기여들에 대해서도 소개한다. 이렇게 살펴본 산업자본주의의 발자취를 토대로, ‘스마트 공동체 사회’라는 희망적 대안을 제시한다. 

이곳은 욕망의 경제권력과 지식권력을 내려놓고 완전고용을 달성하여 빈부의 격차가 없고, 재화와 쾌락이 평등하게 분배되는 사회이다. 이 사회는 인류의 밝은 미래를 가져오기 위해 스마트주의에 입각하여 발전된 기술혁신의 인공지능, 생명공학, 그리고 로봇이 현생인류의 생존을 위협하지 않고 인간을 위해 봉사하고, 지구환경을 회복시켜 이룩한 지속가능의 미래가 보장되는 사회이다. 

인류가 역사를 시작하며 끊임없이 질문해온 ‘어떻게 하면 자연재해, 전쟁, 기아, 질병이 사라진 이상향을 만들 수 있을까?’ 하는 물음에 대한 해답의 실마리를 이 책을 통해 찾아볼 수 있을 것이다.

코로나 팬데믹이 세계 경제시장을 휩쓸고 있다. 한국경제라고 하여 예외는 아니다. 전 세계 사람들의 국가 간 이동이 막혔다. 세계 모든 나라들이 빗장을 걸어 잠그고 자국의 이익 여하에 따라 이합집산한다. 세계 경제의 패권싸움이 새로운 국면을 맞고 있는 것이다. 이 책은 4차 산업혁명 시대의 도래, 코로나 팬데믹 후 세계 그리고 20대 대선 등 굵직한 선택의 기로에 놓인 한국경제에 대한 전망서다.

투자은행 골드만삭스는 2050년 한국경제 규모가 세계 5위권에 진입할 것으로 예측했다. 새로운 10년 안에 과연 무엇이, 어떻게, 얼마나 빨리, 얼마만큼 변할 것인가? 우리는 무엇을 준비하고, 어떻게 대응해야 하는가? 이는 우리나라와 사회의 ‘지속 가능한 생존’ 문제와 직결된다. 

저자는 국민 화해, 통합과 공존과 경제, 교육, 외교 혁명을 통해 경제성장의 속도를 높인다면 이를 15년 빨리 2030년대까지 달성할 수 있을 것이라 본다. 그가 제안하는 10년 후 한국, 우리가 선택해야 할 3가지 핵심이슈를 알아본다.

4차 산업혁명은 시간과 공간의 경계를 허물고, 금융시장의 국제화도 가속화하였다. 투자의사결정은 장기적이고, 전략적인 의사결정이다. 국내시장만 바라볼 것이 아니라 국제금융시장을 이해하고, 해석할 수 있는 힘을 키워야 투자에 성공할 수 있다. 누구나 아는 투자의 기본원칙은 있다. 분산투자, 장기투자 등이 그것이다. 이러한 기본원칙들에 대한 기초적인 이론들을 정리한 책이다. 이러한 이론들은 실제 국제금융투자에서 접하는 질문들에 대한 답을 찾는 데 필요한 필수적인 틀을 제공할 것이다.

21세기의 극적인 자산불평등은 최근 그 어느 때보다 많은 논쟁의 대상이 되고 있다. 세계적으로 자산집중은 점차 거대해지는 추세이다. 수많은 사람들이 하루 1달러로 생계를 유지하는 동안 극소수의 과도한 부자들이 수백억 달러의 자산을 소유하고 있는 상황은 감정적 동요를 불러일으킨다. 

정치가 부자들의 자산집중에 소극적으로 대응하고 부자들에게 유리한 감정정치를 펼친 결과 사람들은 과도한 부자들의 특혜를 수용하는 경향을 갖게 된다. 질투와 증오는 가난한 사람들의 몫이 되고 아량과 동정은 부자들의 미덕이 된다. 그러나 부유한 자들의 박애주의는 과도한 부의 사회적 문제를 보이지 않게끔 만든다. 정의로운 사회를 바라는 사람이라면 자산집중 현상이 어떻게 인식되는지를 이해해야 한다. 과도한 부는 정의원칙을 훼손할 뿐만 아니라 민주주의를 위협하기 때문이다. 

그렇다면 과도한 부에 대항하여 일보 전진하는 방법은 무엇일까? 가난한 사람들의 자산자료는 여러 곳에서 얻을 수 있는 반면, 과도한 부자들의 자산자료는 아주 기초적인 정보조차 숨겨져 있는 상황이다. 저자 마르틴 쉬르츠는 편중된 부에 대한 올바른 논의가 사회적으로 일어나기 위한 선결조건으로서 명확한 자산자료의 확보를 제시한다.

그리고 이를 통해 경제적 불평등에 대한 논의를 활성화시키고자 한다. 한편 이 책은 부유함이라는 딱딱한 주제를 다루면서도 여러 시대를 아우르는 철학자, 문학가들을 소환하여 부유함을 주제로 이야기를 나누는 것도 충분히 즐거운 경험이 될 수 있음을 우리에게 보여 준다.

코로나19 팬데믹은 정말 많은 것들을 바꿔놓았다. 어떤 개인과 기업들은 어쩌면 21세기에 처음이자 마지막으로 부자가 될 기회를 맞이했을 것이고, 또 어떤 개인과 기업들은 전혀 생각지도 못했던 위기를 맞아야 했다. 이는 국가도 마찬가지다. 

저자인 곽수종 박사는 코로나19 팬데믹으로 인해 국가도 무한경쟁 시대를 맞이하게 됐다고 말한다. 이 변화에 빠르게 대처하지 못한다면 대한민국은 글로벌 경쟁에서 뒤처지게 된다는 것이다. 시대의 역동성을 자연스러운 성장과 발전 과정으로 이해하고 반응하는 법을 익히는 것이 무엇보다 중요하다고 말한다.

이 책은 시대의 변화와 목표를 이해하기 위해 인문학적으로도 접근한다. 미국의 독립전쟁 이후 미국이 주도한 ‘국가와 시민의 변화’, 일본 메이지유신으로 대변되는 ‘개혁적 변화’, 뉴질랜드의 ‘위에서 아래로의 변화’를 살펴본다. 

각국의 시대적 상황과 그에 따른 변화와 개혁의 과정을 살펴보면서 대한민국의 현재 상황을 점검하고 변화의 방향을 가늠할 수 있을 것이다. 글로벌 질서 전환의 시대에 대한민국의 현재 좌표는 물론 기업과 개개인이 나아가야 할 방향을 이해하며 경쟁력을 갖추는 데 이 책이 도움이 될 것이다.

들어가는 말 한국경제의 미래를 말한다

프로그래머는 동작하는 코드를 작성하는 법은 알지만, 그저 동작만 한다는 사실은 알지 못한다. 잘 작성된 코드, 이해하기 쉬운 코드, 요구사항의 균형점에 있는 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법은 대부분 알지 못한다. 이 책에서는 동작하는 코드가 아니라 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법을 설명한다. 훌륭한 코드를 작성하는 법을 하나씩 익히다 보면 수습생에서 전문가로 변화할 수 있을 것이다.

코드를 작성하는 일관된 스타일을 익히는 것이 중요하다. 코드의 표현 스타일, 변수 이름 짓기, 오류 처리, 보안 같이 코딩에 필요한 요소들을 익혀서 정말 한 사람이 작성한 게 맞느냐는 얘기는 듣지 않게 하자. 전반부가 코드 작성 그 자체에 대한 이야기라면 후반부는 팀, 개발 프로세스, 명세서 작성, 팀 리뷰, 외부의 제약 조건을 다룬다. 훌륭한 코드는 프로그래머 개인의 코드 작성뿐 아니라 팀, 개발 프로세스, 명세서 작성, 팀 리뷰의 과정을 거친다는 사실을 놓치지 않는다.

자바 핵심 문법과 개념 이해 중심으로 배우는 새로운 자바 입문서. 추후 현업에서 자바로 개발하는 데 필요한 기술을 단계별로, 그리고 익히기 쉬운 순서로 예제를 통해 설명한다. 예제를 직접 손으로 입력해서 실행해보고, 미니 프로젝트도 만들어보며 빠르고 쉽게 자바 프로그래밍을 익힐 수 있도록 구성했다. 

초보자를 위한 쉬운 책이라는 이유로 어려운 개념을 생략하거나 모호한 용어를 사용해 억지로 외우게 하지 않는다. 자바를 자바답게 이해하기 위해 필요하다면 어려운 개념도 다룬다. 그림과 예제를 사용해 최대한 쉽게 설명하고 있다.

대한민국 최고의 경제 전문가이자 베스트셀러 저자 4인이 지금의 불안한 시대를 헤쳐 나가기 위해 다시 책으로 돌아왔다. 한국에서 가장 신뢰받는 애널리스트 홍춘욱, 5년 연속 베스트 애널리스트로 선정되었던 김영익, 베스트 애널리스트상 최다 수상 기록 보유자인 김한진, 개인 투자자들의 절대 지지를 받고 있는 대세 애널리스트 염승환이 공동 저서 『투자의 신세계』와 함께 돌아온 것이다.

홍춘욱 저자는 100여 년에 걸친 주식 시장의 과거를 되돌아보고 실패하지 않는 투자의 길을 알려준다(주식 시장의 역사). 김영익 저자는 세계 경제의 성장 축이 미국에서 아시아로 어떻게 이동하고 있는지 그 과정과 분석하고 대책을 내놓는다(글로벌 경제와 부의 대전환). 김한진 박사는 개인 주식 투자자가 꾸준히 지속할 수 있고 실력까지 향상시킬 수 있는 투자의 방법을 소개하고(투자의 원칙), 염승환 저자는 팬데믹 이후 미래 세계를 예상하고 어디에 어떻게 투자할 것인지 구체적으로 설명한다(다가올 미래에 투자하라). 

『투자의 신세계』는 우리가 왜 주식 시장의 역사를 알아야 하는지, 경제 위기는 언제 어떻게 올 것인지, 앞으로의 주식 시장은 어떤 업종이 유리할지, 현명하게 투자하기 위해 필요한 마인드, 생활 태도는 무엇인지를 자세히 알려줌으로써 투자의 신세계로 갈 수 있게끔 인도한다.

코로나바이러스감염증-19(이하 코로나19)로 인류는 서로 접촉하지 않는, 이른바 ‘언택트 시대’로 접어들었다. 불과 2년 전까지만 해도 선택의 영역이었던 인공지능과 IT 기술이 코로나19를 기점으로 일상 전반을 지배하게 된 것이다.

2020년 8월, 미국을 대표하는 30개 기업의 주가지수를 보여주는 다우지수가 석유기업 엑슨모빌을 92년 만에 퇴출하고, 그 자리에 클라우드 기업 세일즈포스를 올린 것은 석유 경제로 대표되던 3차 산업혁명 시대가 저물고 4차 산업혁명의 시대가 도래했음을 알린 상징적 사건이었다. 

《에이트》와 《에이트 : 씽크》의 작가 이지성이 ‘에이트 시리즈’의 완결편이자 실천편인 《미래의 부》로 돌아왔다. 유튜브 채널 ‘이지성TV’를 통해 5천만 뷰 이상의 폭발적인 관심을 받은 ‘4차 산업혁명 미국 주식 특강’을 토대로 완성된 이 책은, 코로나19로 이미 우리 삶 깊숙이 들어온 인공지능 시대에 재편될 부의 흐름을 읽고 ‘미래의 부’를 창출할 새로운 방법을 제시한다.

계명대학교 국제학연구소 학술총서 3권. 국제금융론과 게임이론 분야에서 세계적인 권위자인 하마다 고이치가 일본경제의 부활 가능성을 알리는 책이다. 그는 ‘일은류이론’을 표방하는 일본은행이 경제학 200년에 기반하는 보편적인 법칙으로 운영하면 일본경제가 곧바로 부활할 것이라 확신한다. 세계경제하에서 일본경제의 부활은 일본과 근접한 위치에 있는 우리가 민감하게 알아차려야 할 사항이다.

2017년 10월 유니버시티 칼리지 런던의 세계번영연구소가 발표한 보고서에서 처음 소개한 ‘보편적 기본서비스’를 본격적으로 소개하는 책이다. 기본서비스는 최근 주목받고 있는 기본소득 운동에 대응해 제안됐다. 따라서 기본서비스와 기본소득 사이에는 화해할 수 없는 명확한 차이점이 있다. 

그건 모든 사람이 지불 능력이 아니라 필요에 따라 생활필수품을 얻을 수 있도록 함께 자원을 모아 위험 분담하기를 원하는가, 아니면 모든 사람의 주머니 속에 약간 더 많은 돈을 넣어주고 우리의 미래를 시장에 맡기기를 원하는가?하는 문제이다. 그래서 이 책은 기본소득 논쟁 나아가 복지 논쟁에 불을 붙이기를 원하고 있다. 즉 불평등의 확대, 흔들리는 복지제도, 지속불가능한 소비 등과 같은 긴급한 문제들을 어떻게 해결할지 논쟁해보자는 것이다.

한국어판 서문 	
서론 우리는 무엇을 함께 하고 어떻게 서로를 도울 것인가	

1장 왜 지금 복지 패러다임의 변화가 필요한가	
왜 부자 나라에 가난한 사람이 늘어나는가	
생존하는 데 필요한 것과 원하는 것은 다르다	
누구나 기본적 필요를 충족할 수 있어야 한다	
사회임금의 가치는 화폐로 환산한 가치보다 크다 	

2장 어떻게 보편적 기본서비스를 운영할 것인가
어떻게 운영되는가	
누구에게 책임이 있는가	
누구에게 권한이 있는가	
어떤 조직 모델이 유용한가	
자금 지원은 어떻게 하는가 	
어떻게 참여를 끌어내는가	
어떤 기준으로 운영하는가	
어떤 자격 조건이 필요한가	
공무원은 무엇을 해야 하는가	
보편적 기본서비스만의 주요 특징은 무엇인가	

3장 보편적 기본서비스의 장점은 무엇인가
평등: 소득 불평등을 줄여준다	
효율성: 투입 대비 산출로 보면 안 된다	
효율성: 인간 삶의 번영이 기준이 된다	
연대: 공감과 책임의식이 높아진다		
지속가능성: 지속 역량으로 작동한다	
기본소득과 보편적 기본서비스를 비교해보자	

4장 보편적 기본서비스의 시작: 돌봄 서비스
의료 서비스와 학교 교육에서 교훈을 얻고 배우자	
‘아동 돌봄’은 조기 교육이자 집단 책임으로 해야 한다	
‘성인 사회적 돌봄’은 성숙한 사회라면 반드시 해야 한다	

5장 보편적 기본서비스의 시작: 주거, 교통, ICT
모든 사람에게는 ‘주거’가 필요하다	
모든 사람에게는 ‘교통’ 수단이 필요하다	
ICT는 새로운 시대의 생활 필수 서비스다	
그 누구도 굶는 일은 없어야 한다	

6장 더 나은 보편적 기본서비스를 만들어가자
정부의 권한과 역량이 바뀌어야 한다	
민주적 의사결정 체제를 갖춰야 한다	
대기업의 독점과 폭리를 막아야 한다	
자본주의하에서 보편적 기본서비스는 가능하다	
보편적 기본서비스 비용이 늘어나지만 감당할 수 있다	
기본소득과 보편적 기본서비스 둘 다를 할 수는 없다

결론 궁극의 복지 시스템으로 나아가자	

역자 후기 보편적 복지국가를 향해 가자

바야흐로 투자의 시대가 도래한 요즘, 좀 더 안정적이고 꾸준한 수익을 얻을 수 있는 금융 상품이 인기다. 저자인 김우석 작가는 《행동재무학자 알 선생이 들려주는 선박금융 이야기》에 행동재무학자로서 그리고 항해학을 전공한 사람으로서 많은 이에게 전하고 싶은 이야기를 담았다. 

이 책은 우리에게 다소 생소한 투자 상품인 ‘선박금융 상품’에 한 걸음 더 다가갈 수 있는 기회를 줄 것이다. 또한, 행동재무학을 바탕으로 하여 우리가 경제적으로 비합리적인 선택을 하는 이유 등 흥미로운 주제를 포함하고 있어 경제 분야에 지식이 없는 사람들에게 친숙하게 다가갈 수 있는 친절한 책이라고 할 수 있다. 금융업에 종사하며 본인이 겪은 지식적인 어려움을 십분 반영하였기에 같은 업계에 종사하는 초보 금융인들에게도 도움이 될 것이다.

해양에 살고 해양에 죽었던 저자의 인생 스토리 또한 많은 이의 눈길을 사로잡을 만하다. 살아남기 위해서 유학길에 오르고 처절하게 공부했던 이야기부터 저자가 추구하는 한국형 선주 사업에 대한 설명, 파이어족이 되어야 하는 이유까지 알찬 내용으로 구성되어 다방면으로 독자의 수요를 만족하는 책이 될 것이다.
