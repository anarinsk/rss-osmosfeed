                    <span>While a growing body of evidence documents large gender disparities in health care and related social insurance programs, little is known about what drives these disparities.  We leverage administrative data and random assignment of doctors to patients inherent within the workers’ compensation insurance claim dispute resolution process to study the impact of gender match between doctors and patients on medical evaluations and subsequent social insurance benefits received. Compared to differences among their male patient counterparts, female patients randomly assigned a female doctor rather than a male doctor are 5.0% more likely to be evaluated as disabled and receive 8.5% more subsequent cash benefits on average. There is no analogous gender-match effect for male patients. The magnitude of these effects implies that having female doctors evaluate patients entirely offsets the observed gender gap in the likelihood of being evaluated as disabled when male doctors evaluate patients. We explore mechanisms through further analysis of the administrative data and complementary survey evidence. In addition, we present broader evidence on gender gaps in workers&#x27; compensation insurance and gender homophily in patients&#x27; selections of doctors in settings where patients have choice. Combining this evidence, we conduct policy counterfactuals illustrating how policies increasing gender diversity among doctors or increasing gender homophily in patient-doctor matches may impact gender gaps in evaluated disability. Our findings indicate that policies increasing the share of female patients evaluated by female doctors may substantially shrink gender gaps in medical evaluations and associated outcomes.</span>

                    <span>There is evidence that physicians disproportionately suffer from substance use disorder and mental health problems.  It is not clear, however, whether these phenomena are causal.  We use data on Dutch medical school applicants to examine the effects of becoming a physician on prescription drug use and the receipt of treatment from a mental health facility.  Leveraging variation from lottery outcomes that determine admission into medical schools, we find that becoming a physician increases the use of antidepressants, opioids, anxiolytics, and sedatives, especially for female physicians. Among female applicants towards the bottom of the GPA distribution, becoming a physician increases the likelihood of receiving treatment from a mental health facility.</span>

                    <span>In this article, we provide a comprehensive, empirical assessment of the hypothesis that the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) affected hospital readmissions. In doing so, we provide evidence as to the validity of prior empirical approaches used to evaluate the HRRP and we present results from a previously unused approach to study this research question—a regression-kink design. Results of our analysis document that the empirical approaches used in most prior research assessing the efficacy of the HRRP often lack internal validity. Therefore, results from these studies may not be informative about the causal consequences of the HRRP. Results from our regression-kink analysis, which we validate, suggest that the HRRP had little effect on hospital readmissions. This finding contrasts with the results of most prior studies, which report that the HRRP significantly reduced readmissions. Our finding is consistent with conceptual considerations related to the assumptions underlying HRRP penalty; in particular, the difficulty of identifying preventable readmissions, the highly imperfect risk adjustment that affects the penalty determination and the absence of proven tools to reduce readmissions.</span>

                    <span>We construct a measure of consumption-equivalent welfare for Black and White Americans. Our statistic incorporates life expectancy, consumption, leisure, and inequality, with mortality rates playing a key role quantitatively. According to our estimates, welfare for Black Americans was 43% of that for White Americans in 1984 and rose to 60% by 2019. Going back further in time (albeit with more limited data), the gap was even larger, with Black welfare equal to just 28% of White welfare in 1940. On the one hand, there has been remarkable progress for Black Americans: the level of their consumption-equivalent welfare increased by a factor of 28 between 1940 and 2019, when aggregate consumption per person rose a more modest 5-fold. On the other hand, despite this remarkable progress, the welfare gap in 2019 remains disconcertingly large. Mortality from COVID-19 has temporarily reversed a decade of progress, lowering Black welfare by 17% while reducing White welfare by 10%.</span>

                    <span>Access to microcredit has been shown to generate only modest average benefits for recipient households. We study whether other financial market frictions—in particular, lack of access to a safe place to save—might limit credit&#x27;s benefits. Working with Kenyan farmers, we cross-randomize access to a simple savings product with a harvest-time loan. Among farmers offered a loan, the additional offer of a savings lockbox increased farm investment by 11% and household consumption by 7%. Results suggest that financial market frictions can interact in important ways and that multifaceted financial access programs might unlock dynamic household gains.</span>

                    <span>Robust support for corporate income taxation is a puzzle for standard tax theory because the tax’s incidence is uncertain and unreliable. We propose a resolution: if the corporate tax is seen as a benefit-based tax, its normative appeal depends on the correspondence between its incidence and that of the benefit which corporations derive from the state’s activities. We show that a simple mechanism makes this correspondence exact—and the net incidence of the tax zero—when the tax base matches what we call the benefit base. As a result, the appeal of the corporate income tax is independent of incidence as conventionally understood.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies how fiscal decentralization affects local services. It explores a 1993 reform that increased the fiscal autonomy of Italian municipalities by replacing government transfers with revenues from a local property tax. Our identifica- tion leverages cross-municipal variation in the degree of decentralization that stems from differences in the average age of buildings caused by bombings during WWII. Decentralization reduced local spending but expanded municipal services, such as nursery schools. These effects are larger in areas with greater political competition. The paper also investigates how the reform affected labor markets. Decentralization increased female labor supply—probably through expanded availability of nursery schools—thereby reducing the gender gap in employment.</span>

It exploits differences between Italian provinces in the value of reconstruction grants they received. Provinces that could modernize more their infrastructure experienced higher increases in agricultural production, especially for perishable crops. In the same provinces, we observe larger investments in labor-saving machines, the entry of more firms into the industrial sector, and a larger expansion of the industrial and service workforce.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented policy responses and a large literature evaluating their impacts. This paper re-examines this literature and investigates the role of researchers&#x27; degrees-of-flexibility on the estimated effects of mobility-reducing policies on social-distancing behavior. We find that two-way fixed effects estimates are not robust to minor changes in usually-unexplored dimensions of the degree-of-flexibility space. While standard robustness tests based on the sequential addition of covariates are very stable, small changes in the outcome variable and its transformation lead to large and sometimes contradictory changes in the estimates, where the same policy can be found to significantly increase or decrease mobility. Yet, due to the large number of degrees-of-flexibility, one can focus on a set of results that appears stable, while ignoring problematic ones. We show that recently developed heterogeneity-robust difference-in-differences estimators only partially mitigate these issues, and discuss how a strategy of identifying the point at which a sequence of ever more-stringent robustness tests eventually fail could increase the credibility of policy evaluations.</span>

                    <span>We evaluate how nonresponse affects conclusions drawn from survey data and consider how researchers can reliably test and correct for nonresponse bias. To do so, we examine a survey on labor market conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic that used randomly assigned financial incentives to encourage participation. We link the survey data to administrative data sources, allowing us to observe a ground truth for participants and nonparticipants. We find evidence of large nonresponse bias, even after correcting for observable differences between participants and nonparticipants. We apply a range of existing methods that account for nonresponse bias due to unobserved differences, including worst-case bounds, bounds that incorporate monotonicity assumptions, and approaches based on parametric and nonparametric selection models. These methods produce bounds (or point estimates) that are either too wide to be useful or far from the ground truth. We show how these shortcomings can be addressed by modeling how nonparticipation can be both active (declining to participate) and passive (not seeing the survey invitation). The model makes use of variation from the randomly assigned financial incentives, as well as the timing of reminder emails. Applying the model to our data produces bounds (or point estimates) that are narrower and closer to the ground truth than the other methods.</span>

                    <span>We study the productivity-pay relationship in the United States and Canada along two dimensions. The first is divergence: the degree to which the levels of productivity and pay have diverged. The second is delinkage: the degree to which incremental increases in the rate of productivity growth translate into incremental increases in the rate of growth of pay, holding all else equal. We show that in both countries the pay of typical workers has diverged substantially from average labor productivity over recent decades, driven by both rising labor income inequality and a declining labor share of income. Even as the levels of productivity and pay have grown further apart, we find evidence for some linkage between productivity and pay in both countries: a one percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth is associated with a positive increase in the rate of pay growth, holding all else equal. This linkage appears stronger in the US than in Canada. Overall, our findings lead us to tentatively conclude that policies or trends which lead to incremental increases in productivity growth, particularly in large relatively closed economies like the USA, will tend to raise middle class incomes. At the same time, other factors orthogonal to productivity growth have been driving productivity and typical pay further apart, emphasizing that much of the evolution in middle class living standards will depend on measures bearing on relative incomes.</span>

                    <span>Racial segregation can occur across educational programs or classrooms within a given school, and there has been particular concern that gifted &amp; talented programs may reduce integration within schools. This paper evaluates the contribution of gifted &amp; talented education to racial segregation using data on the presence and racial composition of gifted &amp; talented programs at virtually all US elementary schools over a span of nine school years. I first show that, consistent with widespread perceptions, gifted &amp; talented programs do disproportionately enroll white and Asian students while Black, Hispanic and Native American students are underrepresented. However, I also show that accounting for the within-school racial sorting caused by these programs has little or no effect on standard measures of overall racial segregation. This is primarily because gifted &amp; talented programs are a small share of total enrollments and do enroll non-negligible numbers of under-represented minority students. I also estimate changes in race-specific enrollments after schools initiate or discontinue gifted &amp; talented programs, and find no significant enrollment changes after programs are eliminated or initiated. I conclude that gifted &amp; talented education is a quantitatively small contributor to racial segregation in US elementary schools.</span>

Such stocks’ lottery features attract greater Google search volume and retail net buying, followed by more negative earnings surprises and lower announcement-period returns. The findings provide insight into the roles of attention and social interaction in securities markets, and support the hypothesis that these forces contribute to investor attraction to lottery stocks.</span>

Our modeling approach allows to show and quantify how policy changes the future size of the labor force, which we assess with a series of what-if scenarios. 
Both the US and Germany are expected to undergo demographic aging, but their demographic fundamentals differ starkly. This has strong implications for their labor force developments. According to our microsimulation, the US labor force will, despite population aging, increase by 16.2 percent in the age groups 15 to…</span>

                    <span>We propose an approach to modeling and estimating discrete choice demand that allows for a large number of zero sale observations, rich unobserved heterogeneity, and endogenous prices. We do so by modeling small market sizes through Poisson arrivals. Each of these arriving consumers then solves a standard discrete choice problem. We present a Bayesian IV estimation approach that addresses sampling error in product shares and scales well to rich data environments. The data requirements are traditional market-level data and measures of consumer search intensity. After presenting simulation studies, we consider an empirical application of air travel demand where product-level sales are sparse. We find considerable variation in demand over time. Periods of peak demand feature both larger market sizes and consumers with higher willingness to pay. This amplifies cyclicality. However, observed frequent price and capacity adjustments offset some of this compounding effect.</span>

                    <span>The distributions of wealth in the US and many other countries are strikingly concentrated on the top and skewed to the right. To explain the income and wealth inequality, we provide a tractable heterogeneous-agent model with incomplete markets in continuous time. We separate illiquid capital assets from liquid bond assets and introduce capital return jump risks. Under recursive utility, we derive optimal consumption and wealth in closed form and show that the stationary wealth distribution has an exponential right tail. Our calibrated model can match the income and wealth distributions in the US data including the extreme right tail. We also study the effect of taxes on the distribution of wealth.</span>

                    <span>In response to the record-breaking COVID19 recession, many governments have adopted unprecedented fiscal stimuli. While countercyclical fiscal policy is effective in fighting conventional recessions, little is known about the effectiveness of fiscal policy in the current environment with widespread shelter-in-place (“lockdown”) policies and the associated considerable limits on economic activity. Using detailed regional variation in economic conditions, lockdown policies, and U.S. government spending, we document that the effects of government spending were stronger during the peak of the pandemic recession, but only in cities that were not subject to strong stay-at-home orders. We examine mechanisms that can account for our evidence and place our findings in the context of other recent evidence from microdata.</span>

                    <span>The U.S. entrepreneurial finance market has changed dramatically over the last two decades. Entrepreneurs raising their first round of venture capital retain 30% more equity in their firm and are more likely to control their board of directors. Late-stage startups are raising larger amounts of capital in the private markets from a growing pool of traditional and new investors. These private market changes have coincided with a sharp decline in the number of firms going public—and when firms do go public, they are older and have raised more private capital. To understand these facts, we provide a systematic description of the differences between private and public firms. Next, we review several regulatory, technological, and competitive changes affecting both startups and investors that help explain how the trade-offs between going public and staying private have changed. We conclude by listing several open research questions.</span>

In this paper we provide estimates of the standard of living by commuting zone for households in a given income or education group, and we study how they relate to local cost of living. Using a novel dataset, we observe debit and credit card transactions, check and ACH payments, and cash withdrawals of 5% of US households in 2014 and use it to measure mean consumption expenditures by commuting zone and income group. To measure local prices, we build income-specific consumer price indices by commuting zone. We uncover vast geographical differences in material standard of living for…</span>

                    <span>We resuscitated the mixed-frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR) developed in Schorfheide and Song (2015, JBES) to generate macroeconomic forecasts for the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic in real time. The model combines eleven time series observed at two frequencies: quarterly and monthly. We deliberately did not modify the model specification in view of the COVID-19 outbreak, except for the exclusion of crisis observations from the estimation sample. We compare the MF-VAR forecasts to the median forecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). While the MF-VAR performed poorly during 2020:Q2, subsequent forecasts were at par with the SPF forecasts. We show that excluding a few months of extreme observations is a promising way of handling VAR estimation going forward, as an alternative of a sophisticated modeling of outliers.</span>

                    <span>Large and rapid upswings in illicit drug use display similar properties to infectious disease epidemics. In this chapter, we review research to understand what causes drug epidemics and how they end. Drug market actors are subject to both positive and negative reinforcement that lead to rapid, nonlinear increases and decreases in drug market activity. There is evidence that drug epidemics cause serious problems, including drug overdoses, adverse birth outcomes, homicides, lower educational attainment, and migration from neighborhoods subject to intense drug market activity. Many of these costs are borne by those who do not consume or sell drugs. Given the frequency, size, and impacts of illicit drug epidemics, they deserve more attention by researchers and policy-makers.</span>

The resulting wage-rigidity framework delivers a model very similar to that in Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009), with their habit parameter replaced by our probability of wage-contract resetting. That is, if wage contracts can be reset very frequently, labor supply behaves in accordance with King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988) preferences, whereas if they are sticky for a long time, we obtain the setting in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988), thus allowing significant responses of hours to wage changes.</span>

Student achievement depends on cognitive ability, motivation, effort, and match of school curriculum to ability. Exercising charter school autonomy over curriculum, to maximize achievement gains, the charter sets curriculum to attract the highest ability students. Achievement gains are modest, consistent with empirical evidence. We next investigate a no-excuses charter that not only chooses curriculum but also enforces an effort minimum. Consistent with the evidence, highly motivated students select into the charter, achievement gains are large, and the largest gains accrue to those who would be lower performers in public school.</span>

                    <span>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the debate on monetary financing has been reignited and several economists have called for governments to borrow from their central banks to finance larger deficits. This column looks to sub-Saharan Africa, a region where ‘fiscal dominance’ has long been widespread, for useful insights into this debate. It finds that central bank financing of government does have an inflationary impact through the exchange rate channel. Numerical legal limits on central bank financing can be an effective way to mitigate the risks, even if they are not always binding.</span>

                    <span>A few key points:
1) There is a clear seasonal pattern for house prices.
2) The surge in distressed sales during the housing bust distorted the seasonal pattern.
3) Even though distressed sales are down significantly, the seasonal factor is based on several years of data - and the factor is now closer to normal (second graph below).
4) Still the seasonal index is probably a better indicator of actual price movements than the Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) index.
For in depth description of these issues, see Jed Kolko&#x27;s article from 2014 (currently Chief Economist at Indeed) &quot;Let’s Improve, Not Ignore, Seasonal Adjustment of Housing Data&quot;
Note: I was one of several people to question the change in the seasonal factor (here is a post in 2009) - and this led to S&amp;P Case-Shiller questioning the seasonal factor too (from April 2010).  I still use the seasonal factor (I think it is better than using the NSA data).
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows the month-to-month change in the NSA Case-Shiller National index since 1987 (through September 2021). The seasonal pattern was smaller back in the &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s and increased once the bubble burst. 
The seasonal swings declined following the bubble, however the recent price surge changed the month-over-month pattern.
The second graph shows the seasonal factors for the Case-Shiller National index since 1987.  The factors started to change near the peak of the bubble, and really increased during the bust.   
The swings in the seasonal factors have decreased, and the seasonal factors has been moving back towards more normal levels.

Note that the recent price surge hasn&#x27;t distorted the seasonal factors.</span>

                    <span>One of the concerns in the debate on climate change is whether financial flows contribute to the reduction of emissions. This column looks at the role bond market-based and bank-based debt plays in the allocation of resources to fossil fuel in the context of the risk of stranded assets. The authors show that banks continue to provide financing to fossil fuel firms that the bond market would not finance as long as they do not price the risk of stranded assets. In this setting, stranded assets risks may have shifted to large banks.</span>

                    <span>This data is as of November 30th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearance Plan Total Drops Below the Million Mark
Daily tracking data through December 1 shows the number of active forbearance plan totals dropping below 1 million for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans fell by 23,000 (-2.3%) this week, led by a 14,000 (-3.9%) drop in FHA/VA loans. Both GSE (-7K/-2%) and PLS/portfolio (-2K/-.6%) plan volumes also improved.
As of November 30, 994,000 mortgage holders (1.9%) remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, including 1.1% of GSE, 2.9% of FHA/VA and 2.5% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
  Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Overall, the number of forbearance plans is down by 215,000 (-18%) from the same time last month, with the potential for additional improvements as we progress through December. After seeing starts jump before Thanksgiving, they fell to a pandemic low this week.  This week’s low was likely due to the shorter holiday week.

                    <span>From the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Rail Time Indicators.  Graphs and excerpts reprinted with permission. 
U.S. railroads originated 917,787 total carloads in November 2021, up 2.0% over November 2020  and down 3.9% from November 2019. The 2.0% gain in November was the ninth straight gain, but it was  also the smallest percentage gain in those nine months.
...
U.S. railroads originated 1.03 million intermodal containers and trailers in November, down 9.6%  from November 2020 and up 0.8% over November 2019. November 2021 was the fourth straight month  in which intermodal volume fell, and the 9.6% decline was the biggest decline in those four months. In  2021, September, October, and November were all in the bottom half of months in terms of intermodal  volume, something that has never happened before in our records that go back to 1989.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
U.S. railroads originated 917,787 total carloads in  November 2021, up 2.0% over November 2020 and down  3.9% from November 2019. Total carloads averaged  229,447 per week in November 2021, the third lowest  weekly average for total carloads so far this year. (In part  because of Thanksgiving, November is usually in the  bottom half of all months in terms of total carloads.)
The second graph shows the six week average (not monthly) of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
Intermodal is not included in carload figures. In  November 2021, U.S. railroads originated 1.03 million  containers and trailers, down 9.6% from November 2020  and up 0.8% over November 2019. November 2021 was  the fourth straight month in which year-over-year  intermodal volume fell; November’s 9.6% decline is the  biggest decline in those four months. Intermodal volume  averaged 257,010 units per week in November; only  February (253,999) was lower so this year.</span>

니오, 샤오펑, 리오토 등 넥스트 테슬라를 외치는 중국 기업들이 두각을 드러내며 중국을 자동차 후진국에서 모빌리티 강국으로 탈바꿈시키고 있다. 그리고 중국의 거대한 시장 잠재력을 꿰뚫어 본 글로벌 자동차 업체들이 차이나 모빌리티에 올라타기 위해 앞다퉈 투자에 나서고 있다. 과연 미래 모빌리티라는 피할 수 없는 변화의 물결 앞에서 우리는 어떻게 대응해야 할까.

한국은 세계 5위 자동차 생산국이지만, 모빌리티 비즈니스 부문에서는 후발주자에 가깝다. 결국 미래 모빌리티의 핵심 강국으로 떠오르는 차이나 모빌리티에 주목해야 앞으로 생존을 넘어서 100년 만에 찾아온 새로운 모빌리티 시대를 주도할 수 있다. 차이나 모빌리티의 모든 것이 이 책에 담겨 있다.

“수신료의 가치를 증명한 명품 다큐” 등 시청자들의 뜨거운 호평을 받은 2021년 화제의 다큐멘터리 〈팬데믹 머니〉가 책으로 만들어졌다. 2차 세계대전 이후 최악의 실물경제와 최대 호황을 맞이한 자산 시장이 교차하는 이 모순된 현실은 왜 발생하는 걸까? 

그 답을 구하기 위해 〈팬데믹 머니〉 제작진은 제러미 리프킨, 제이슨 솅커, 오건영, 박종훈 등 국내외 최고 경제 전문가들을 만나 달러라는 기축통화가 작동하는 방식부터 어마어마하게 풀린 돈이 거품과 부채를 만들고 결국 경제 위기를 불러일으키는 과정을 깊이 있게 추적한다.

특히 『팬데믹 머니: 감염된 경제, 풀린 돈의 역습에 대비하라』는 방송에서 미처 다 보여주지 못한 전문가들과의 대담을 수록했다. 또한 2022년 달라질 경제 환경과 자산 시장에 대해 통화정책 전문가 김진일 고려대 교수와 금융 전문가 오건영 신한은행 부부장과 이야기를 나눴다.

We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose 575k in November ... Big Data employment indicators were mixed in the month, and we also see some chance that labor supply constraints weighed on pre-holiday hiring in the retail industry. ... We estimate a one-tenth drop in the unemployment rate to 4.5%, reflecting a strong household employment gain but a likely rebound in the labor force participation rate

Excerpt: 
The Zillow measure is up 11.2% YoY in October, up from 10.3% YoY in September. And the ApartmentList measure is up 17.7% as of November, up from 16.9% in October. Both the Zillow measure (a repeat rent index), and ApartmentList are showing a sharp increase in rents. 
...
Clearly rents are increasing sharply, and we should expect this to spill over into measures of inflation in 2022. The Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) was up 3.1% YoY in October, from 2.9% in September - and will increase further in the coming months.</span>

From CoStar: STR: Thanksgiving Boosts US Weekly Hotel Performance
U.S. hotel performance came in higher than any other Thanksgiving week on record, according to STR‘s latest data through November 27.
November 21-27, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 53.0% (+4.6%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $128.41 (+14.3%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $68.00 (+19.6%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.

The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

This was the first week with an increase over the same week in 2019.

This column reviews the literature and shows that air and water pollution are declining but greenhouse gas emissions are not because CO2 has been targeted less by environmental policy. These trends appear to provide large net benefits to US society and using cost-effective market-based policies does not appear to have systematic implications for the equality of environmental outcomes.</span>

                    <span>Access to large buyers is increasingly believed to facilitate firm growth and job creation. This column uses an experiment with small and medium-sized firms in Liberia to analyse whether purely informational barriers exclude firms from accessing growth-conducive value chains. Exposing firms to a week-long ‘sellership’ programme helped them win more and better contracts, and the treatment had long-term effects. As the informational constraint is shown to bind for a quartile of firms, reducing informational barriers can help level the playing field and may also improve overall allocative efficiency.</span>

The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
After April 2020, sales increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic).  


However, sales decreased earlier this year due to supply issues. It appears the &quot;supply chain bottom&quot; was in September, but sales in November were disappointing.</span>

                    <span>Fed&#x27;s Beige Book &quot;This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago based on information collected on or before November 19, 2021.&quot;
Economic activity grew at a modest to moderate pace in most Federal Reserve Districts during October and early November. Several Districts noted that despite strong demand, growth was constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Consumer spending increased modestly; low inventories held back sales of some items, notably light vehicles. Leisure and hospitality activity picked up in most Districts as the spread of the Delta variant ebbed in many areas. Construction activity generally increased but was held back by scarce materials and labor. Nonresidential real estate activity increased widely, while residential real estate activity…</span>

Excerpt (there is much more): 
In October 2004, Fed economist John Krainer and researcher Chishen Wei wrote a Fed letter on price to rent ratios: House Prices and Fundamental Value. Kainer and Wei presented a price-to-rent ratio using the OFHEO house price index and the Owners&#x27; Equivalent Rent (OER) from the BLS.
Here is a similar graph using the Case-Shiller National and Composite 20 House Price Indexes. This graph shows the price to rent ratio (January 2000 &#x3D; 1.0). The price-to-rent ratio had been moving more sideways but picked up significantly recently.
On a price-to-rent basis, the Case-Shiller National index is back to January 2006 levels, and the Composite 20 index is back to March 2005 levels.

                    <span>From the Census Bureau reported that overall construction spending increased 0.2%:
Construction spending during October 2021 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,598.0 billion, 0.2 percent above the revised September estimate of $1,594.8 billion. The October figure is 8.6 percent above the October 2020 estimate of $1,471.7 billion.
emphasis added
Private spending decreased and public spending increased:
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,245.0 billion, 0.2 percent below the revised September estimate of $1,247.9 billion....
In October, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $353.0 billion, 1.8 percent above the revised September estimate of $346.8 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 14% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 13% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been soft recently.
Public construction spending is 8% above the peak in March 2009.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 16.7%.  Non-residential spending is up 3.1% year-over-year.  Public spending is up 0.4% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service during the early months of the pandemic in most areas, and did not decline sharply like many other sectors.  However, some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 32.4% YoY.

This was below consensus expectations of a 0.4% increase in spending; however, construction spending for the previous two months was revised up.</span>

                    <span>From ADP:
Private sector employment increased by 534,000 jobs from   October to November according to the November ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly  distributed to the public each month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by  the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from  ADP’s actual data of those who are on a company’s payroll, measures the change in total nonfarm private  employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis
“The labor market recovery continued to power through its challenges last month,” said Nela Richardson,  chief economist, ADP. “November’s job gains bring the three month average to 543,000 monthly jobs  added, a modest uptick from the job pace earlier this year. Job gains have eclipsed 15 million since the  recovery began, though 5 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels. Service providers, which are more  vulnerable to the pandemic, have dominated job gains this year. It’s too early to tell if the Omicron variant  could potentially slow the jobs recovery in coming months.”
emphasis added
  This was close to the consensus forecast of 525,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 563 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in November.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.</span>

금리와 환율만 알면 경제 공부 다했다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 금리와 환율에는 국내외 경제 상황이 총체적으로 반영되어 있기 때문이다. 금리와 환율이 주가에 미치는 영향이나 상관관계에 따른 책은 많으나, 금리와 환율에만 초점을 맞추며 경제를 풀어내는 책은 찾기 어렵다. 그래서 ‘거시경제의 거장’이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 『금리와 환율 알고 갑시다』를 통해 어렵고 복잡한 경제이론과 시장의 상황을 낱낱이 분석하여 자신만의 철학으로 쉽게 명쾌하게 풀어낸다. 

지금 우리에게 필요한 것은 단순 금리와 환율의 개념이 아니다. 금리와 환율을 통해 현재의 경제 상황을 이해하고, 미래를 내다볼 수 있는 통찰력을 갖추어 조금 더 명확하게 경제의 흐름을 파악하는 안목이다. 그 깊이 있는 안목은 금리 인상(하락), 환율 변동, 집값 상승(하락) 등의 위기에도 올바른 판단과 실행을 이룰 수 있게 도와줄 것이다.

프롤로그: 금리와 환율 알고 갑시다

제1부 금리 알고 갑시다
금리란 무엇일까요?
• 금리의 기원은 신용에 있습니다
• 경제학 교과서에서는 현재의 소비를 참는 데에 대한 대가를 금리라 합니다
한국은행의 통화정책 수단, 기준금리
• 한국은행의 기준금리는 모든 금리의 기준입니다
• 기준금리는 한국은행 금융통화위원회에서 결정합니다
• 통화정책방향 결정문과 의사록은 꼭 보아야 합니다
• 비둘기파와 매파의 구분은 이렇습니다
• 한국은행은 기준금리를 왜 올리고 내릴까요?
• 기준금리는 어떻게 물가에 영향을 주나요?
• 미국의 기준금리는 연방기금금리 입니다
• 적정 기준금리 수준을 결정하는 하나의 방법이 테일러준칙이라 합니다
금리인상이 가계와 자영업자에 미치는 영향
• 금리인상으로 가계 이자부담금액이 늘어나게 되었습니다
• 금리인상으로 자영업자 부담도 더 늘어납니다
• 금리가 오르면 가계 전체적으로는 이익입니다
단리와 복리
• 저축은 복리로 해야 합니다
• 72법칙을 알아야 합니다
• 중국이 미국 GDP에 접근해가는 것도 복리의 마법에 있습니다
금리와 채권 가격은 역관계
• 금리가 오르면 채권 가격은 떨어집니다
• 채권의 수요와 공급에 따라 가격과 금리가 결정됩니다
• 금리 하락기에 채권투자를 해야 합니다
금리로 미래의 경제를 예측 — 금리의 기간구조 
• 수익률 곡선은 채권만기에 따른 수익률을 연결한 선입니다
• 장단기 금리차이가 선행지수에 앞서갑니다
• 장단기 금리차로 미래의 경제성장률도 예상해볼 수 있습니다
• 장단기 금리차이 역전은 경기침체를 예고합니다
금리로 금융시장 안정성 판단 — 금리의 위험구조
• 금융시장이 불안하면 위험 프리미엄이 확대됩니다
통화와 금리의 관계 
• 통화 공급이 늘어나면 유동성 효과로 금리가 떨어집니다
• 소득효과와 피셔효과로 금리는 다시 상승합니다
예금금리와 대출금리
• 가중평균금리를 보면 금리 추이를 알 수 있습니다
• 한국은행연합회에서 예금과 대출금리를 비교해줍니다
• 첫째, 대출금리가 어떻게 결정되는 건가요?
• 둘째, 대출금리의 종류는 어떤 것들이 있나요?
• 셋째...

                    <span>It is widely believed that the productivity gains from place-based policies are geographically highly localised. This column argues instead that productivity spillovers from local place-based policies may propagate far beyond the initial target region to the entire economy, through the plant-level networks of multi-region firms. But while these productivity spillovers amplify the aggregate welfare gains from local place-based policies, they widen economic disparities between individual workers and regions in the economy.</span>

                    <span>What drives gender wage gaps – and how best to close them – remains a contested topic of economic research. Using data from matched employer-employee registers in France from 1995 to 2015, this column finds that discrepancies in pay are driven largely by men and women working in different firms rather than similar men and women being paid differently at the same firm. Understanding why the share of the gender gap ascribed to firms persists over time and across cohorts remains an essential policy puzzle for further reducing wage disparities.</span>

지난 2,000년 사이에 지구의 온도는 1도 정도를 오르내리는 선에서 안정적으로 유지되었다. 덕분에 인류는 살아남아 번영을 구가했고 전 세계 인구는 70억까지 늘어났다. 그러나 지금의 세계는 지구온난화로 인한 기상이변으로 돌이킬 수 없는 타격을 입고 있다. 경제적 측면에서도 위기의 상황에 접어들었다. 

이에 저자는 지금 당장 국가, 기업이 탄소 중심의 경제 체제에서 벗어나 재생에너지, 전기자동차 등 저탄소 경제 체제로 변화하지 않으면 미래는 없다고 단언하고 이미 기후위기를 기회로 만드는 국가와 기업들의 사례를 통해 우리에게 나아가야 할 방향을 제시한다.

회복과 재생을 촉진하는 새로운 미래 자본주의 모델 안내서 《그린 스완》이 출간됐다. 그린 스완은 지난 2007년 뉴욕대학교 교수 나심 니콜라스 탈레브가 제시한 용어 ‘블랙 스완’에서 파생했다. 블랙 스완은 가능성이 극히 적지만, 일단 발생하면 돌이킬 수 없을 정도의 엄청난 충격을 주는 사건을 말한다. 9.11 테러나 2008년 세계 금융위기가 그 대표적인 예다. 그린 스완은 ‘해결책’을 더한, ‘자본시장의 변화를 촉진하는 개념’으로 지속가능성 측면에서 새롭게 정의한 미래 자본주의 모델이라고 할 수 있다. 

이 책은 이미 시작된 ‘변화의 징후’를 읽는 10가지 용어인 목적, 비즈니스 모델, 수익, 성장, 가치, 임팩트, 책임, 중대성, 지배구조, 좌초자산을 통해 세계 경제의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있음을 확인한다. 기업에서 전례가 없는 엄청난 사안에 직면하게 될 때, 종종 ‘사악한 문제’가 발생한다. 예를 들면 담배 회사는 흡연이 수많은 질병을 일으킨다는 것을 알면서도 그 문제를 은폐해왔고, 결국 거대한 액수의 벌금을 선고받아야 했다.

저자가 지적하는 사악한 문제는 크게 다섯 가지다. 플라스틱 쓰레기로 오염된 바다, 살인자 칼로리, 항생제가 초래한 슈퍼버그, 탄소가 급격히 기온을 상승시킨 것, 심각하게 증가한 우주 쓰레기다. 책에서는 이를 해결하기 위한 다섯 가지 패러다임을 짚어내고, 그린 스완의 특성을 지닌 자본주의와 민주주의 그리고 지속가능성을 제시한다. 저자는 세계 기업들에 다음과 같이 엄중하게 윤리성을 촉구한다.

‘공정한 보상’의 저자 신재용 교수는 ‘MZ세대에게 ‘공정’이란 노력에 대한 정당한 대가를 의미하는 매우 실용적인 개념’이라고 말한다. 부도 신분도 대물림되는, 별다른 출구가 없는 이 세대가 살아남기 위해 강조하는 레토릭(rhetoric)이 바로 ‘공정’인 것이다. 

MZ세대는 ‘교환(exchange)’이라는 틀로 세상을 본다. 신재용 교수는 이 책에서 화이트칼라 MZ세대의 특수한 성장배경을 분석하며, 학창시절부터 통과의례처럼 거듭한 토너먼트 경쟁 끝에 현재의 직장에 자리한 이들에게 ‘투입한 노력에 상응하는 대가’를 받는 공정한 교환관계를 유지하는 것이야말로 자신을 지키는 일임을 밝힌다.

01 왜 지금 공정한 보상인가?
공정이 최고의 가치다: 공정성에 민감한 MZ세대의 등장
화이트칼라 MZ세대가 생각하는 공정은 다르다
화이트칼라 MZ세대는 왜 공정한 보상에 더 민감한가?
MZ세대의 토너먼트 연대기
더 이상 비밀은 없다-MZ세대의 소속기반 커뮤니티
왜 갑자기 지금? 최근의 성과급 논란
SK하이닉스 성과급 논란: 이천 쌀집에서는 무슨 일이 있었나?
EVA&#x3D;영업이익-세금-자본비용

02 무엇이 공정한 보상인가?
보상을 보는 두 가지 이론
기본급 결정을 위한 세 가지 실무
한국기업의 성과급: 인재의 영입, 유지, 동기부여의 도구인가?
한국의 MZ세대 직장인들은 보상을 공정하다고 생각할까?
보상은 무엇에 근거해야 하는가?
공정과 “운”의 필터링
글로벌 기업 CEO 보상을 둘러싼 논쟁
[더 알아보기1] 암젠(Amgen)의 CEO 성과보상 사례
[더 알아보기2] 사회적 가치 혹은 사회성과에 근거한 보상
[더 알아보기3] 넷플릭스 드라마 ‘오징어 게임’에서 나오는 게임들 중 가장 공정한 게임은?

03 성과에 근거한 보상: 성과측정과 인센티브 설계
성과목표는 왜 필요할까?
성과지표의 선정
성과-보상 간 민감도 결정

04 임직원 보상격차
우리 사장님은 얼마 받고 일하실까?
나도 언젠가 그 자리에 올라갈 수 있으니까-토너먼트 이론
임원은 직원의 몇 배를 받아야 할까?
토너먼트 이론과 공정성 이론은 공존할 수 있을까?
중요한 것은 승진가능성!
전무, 상무의 동기부여가 직원보다 더 중요하다

05 어디로 나아갈 것인가? 보다 공정한 보상을 위한 제언
MZ세대의 보상에 대한 요구를 이해하고 제도를 정렬하라
집단을 넘어 개인의 성과로: 역량 있는 관리자의 육성부터 시작하자
평가/보상의 투명성이 중요하다
직급 중심에서 역할 중심으로, 획일적인 보상에서 다양한 보상으로
성장할 수 있는 기회도 보상의 일부다

협동조합기본법 시행 10년, ‘협동조합 2만 개 시대’를 맞아 지나온 역사와 현실 상황을 살피고, 한국의 협동조합은 무엇을 해야 할지 모색하며 새로운 대안으로 ‘협동조합 허브론’을 제시한다.

협동조합 운동의 본질은 협동하려는 인간에 대한 신뢰를 바탕으로 자유롭고 평등한 사회를 만들겠다는 인류의 꿈을 실현하는 것이다. 그러나 갈수록 심해지는 불평등과 인류의 존재 자체를 위협하는 기후 위기 앞에서 그 꿈은 닿을 수 없는 이상에 불과한 것 아닌가 하는 회의의 정서가 짙다. 

책은 그런 참혹한 현실을 직시하면서, 그럼에도 불구하고 협동조합만이 할 수 있는 영역이 분명히 있음을 확인한다. 그것은 협동조합이 작은 협동의 경험들을 이어 큰 협동으로 나아가는 접착제 역할을 하고 사회 곳곳을 협동으로 연결하는 허브가 되는 것이다.

김기태, 강민수 두 저자는 한국 협동조합 운동의 산증인으로, 현장은 물론 협동조합 연구 분야에서도 혁혁한 성과를 보여 주었다. 이제 협동조합 허브론이라는 새로운 운동론을 제안하며 40년 전 레이들로가 ICA(국제협동조합연맹) 모스크바 대회에서 제기한 협동조합의 정체성에서 한 걸음 더 나아갈 것을 촉구한다.

북한과 인접한 해안가에는 파도에 떠밀려 온 북한 생활 쓰레기가 가득하다. 이 지역에서 수거한 북한 생활 쓰레기 제품 포장지는 모두 708종의 1,414점이다. 당과류와 음료류는 물론 식품류와 잡화류 그리고 의약품까지 실로 그 종류가 엄청나다. 

자력갱생을 강조하는 북한에서 어떻게 이리도 다양한 상품을 만들어 내는지 그저 의아할 뿐이었다. 그렇게 하나둘 모은 생활 쓰레기는 북한 사회를 읽는 소중한 자료이자 보물이 되었다. 생활쓰레기 포장지는 북한 제품의 브랜드와 디자인, 생산공장 현황 그리고 정치선전을 엿볼 수 있다. 북한사람들의 흔적이 고스란히 담긴 서해안의 으로 함께 떠나보자.

                    <span>앞으로 100년 : 인류의 미래를 위한 100장의 지도
이언 골딘 외 지음, 권태형 외 옮김 / 동아시아 / 2021년 11월 / ISBN:9788962624045
정가: 32,000원 / 판매가: 28,800원 / 마일리지: 120원
이벤트: 화제의 책+알라딘 사은품(이벤트 도서 포함, 국내도서 4만원 이상)




옥스퍼드 마틴 스쿨의 창립자이자 세계화 및 국제 개발 분야의 권위자인 이언 골딘과 정치학, 안보학 분야의 석학인 이가라페 연구소의 로버트 머가가 함께 쓴 책이다. 수십 년 간 축적된 연구 및 데이터에 최신의 위성 사진 및 지도 자료를 결합시켰다. 세계화, 기후, 도시화, 불공정, 폭력, 보건, 인구…, 인류가 맞이하고 있는 열네 가지의 중대한 국면을 낱낱이 분석하고 각 현안들을 명쾌한 이미지로 시각화하여 보여준다.

19세기 광고계의 거물이었던 프레드 버나드는 “한 장의 이미지가 천 마디의 말보다 낫다”라는 말을 남겼다. 그 말처럼, 『앞으로 100년』에서 이언 골딘과 로버트 머가가 전하는 메시지는 구체화된 이미지를 통해 사람들에게 가닿는다. 인류가 지구에 어떤 영향을 미치고 있을까? 지금 인류가 지구 위에서 지속 가능한 삶을 꾸려가려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 북극에서 일어나는 화재, 전 세계에서 동시다발적으로 일어나는 해수면의 상승, 이민자에 대한 사람들의 편견과 그 이면의 진실…. 

이 모두를 단순한 말이 아니라 구체적인 이미지로 전달한다. 다양한 방식으로 제작된 100장을 훌쩍 넘어서는 지도와 인포그래픽은 압축적이면서도 설명적이다. 저자들은 때로는 우리의 직관에 어긋나기도 하는 세계의 단면을 냉철하게 제시한다. 그러면서도 그 목소리에는 호소력이 있다. 왜냐면 그들에게는 인류가 맞이한 문제와 앞으로 나아가야 할 방향에 대한 명확한 비전이 있기 때문이다.

저자들이 제시하는 것은 이 지구 위에서 인류가 살아남고, 지속 가능한 삶을 살기 위한 거대한 로드맵이다. 이 책은 인류가 미지의 땅을 헤쳐나가기 위해 집어들어야 할 필수적인 생존 가이드북이다.

경제학박사 정인호 교수의 책. 이 책은 블록체인의 진정한 장점이 무엇인지, 그것이 어떻게 확장될 수 있는지, 그리고 그 결과 얼마나 광범위하고 심원한 변화가 우리 생활에서 나타날 것인지를 친절하게 설명하고 있다. 저자는 조개에서 시작한 돈의 진화가, 모바일과 블록체인을 통해 혁명적으로 변화하는 과정을 보여준다. 그리고 그것을 통해 금융의 미래를 어떻게 짜야 하는지 방향을 제시한다.

                    <span>The competitive impacts of vertical mergers are a long-standing question in antitrust economics. A recent wave of vertical mergers has reinvigorated the academic and policy debate on enforcement, and the discussion is far from settled. An example of this is that US antitrust authorities presented new vertical merger guidelines in 2020, but the Federal Trade […]

모바일과 인터넷을 삶에서 결코 떼어낼 수 없는 젊은 세대이든, 종이 신문이 오히려 익숙한 ‘올드 제너레이션’이든, 하루도 빠짐없이 맞닥뜨리게 되는 언어들이 있다. 많은 이들이 그저 고개를 갸우뚱할 뿐 또렷하게 이해하지 못 하는, 그렇다고 딱히 물어볼 데도 없고 네이버로 검색을 해봐도 속 시원하게 개념이 정리되지도 않아 어정쩡한 채로 머릿속을 맴도는, 저 숱한 경제용어들이 바로 그 언어다. 싹 무시해버릴 수도 없고 그렇다고 들러붙어 공부하기도 쉽지 않은 이 용어들은 대체로 몇 개의 타입으로 나뉜다. 

이해하기 난감한 최신 경제용어 160개를 선정해 제목처럼 ‘명쾌하고 야무지게’ 해설한 책을 독자들에게 제시한다. 단순한 개념 정의는 말할 것도 없거니와, 그 용어가 생겨난 배경이나 경제 환경, 그 용어가 우리의 일상생활, 직장생활, 그리고 투자 활동에 미치게 될 영향이나 충격, 해설을 한층 더 생생하게 만들어주는 실제 기업이나 인물들의 사례, 좀 더 수월한 이해를 도와줄 이미지와 도표와 차트 및 통계치, 향후 경제의 흐름을 어느 정도 예측할 수 있게 도와주는 전문가들의 조언에 이르기까지. 

이 책 한 권이면 골치 아팠던 핵심 경제용어들이 또렷이 이해되어 친하게 다가올 뿐 아니라, 마지막 장을 덮을 때쯤이면 누구나 ‘나름 경제전문가’의 경지에 이를 수 있을 것이다. 물론 현명하고 민첩한 재테크 기술의 습득은 짜릿한 보너스다.

중앙일보 경제부 기자들과 함께 ‘금융 SOS’를 연재하고 있는 경제 기자가 쓴 책이다. 누구나 한 번쯤은 가족간 돈거래, 부동산, 빚, 기타 금융사고 등으로 인해 어려움을 겪는다. 하지만 금융 관련 직종 종사자나 전공자가 아니고서야 인터넷을 구석구석 뒤진다 해도 해결책을 찾기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니다. 

이 책은 그런 어려움을 겪는 이들에게 상비약이 되어줄 유용한 경제지침서이다. 저자는 흔히 벌어지는 각종 금융 사건·사고의 다양한 실제 사례를 직접 취재하고, 변호사와 금융 전문가들의 자문을 받아 그에 대한 ‘해결책’을 찾는 데 초점을 맞추었다.

일반 독자들에게 단순히 ‘어떻게 하면 돈을 잘 모을 수 있는지’와 같은 경제와 금융 관련 정보를 전달하는 데 그치는 것이 아니라, 금융에 대해 잘 알지 못하는 일반 사람들, 특히 금융 사각지대에 놓인 이들에게 실질적인 도움을 주기 위해 쓰였다. 개인 혼자 해결하기 어려운 금융문제의 대처법을 일목요연하게 정리했다.

2장 돈 쓰는 지혜를 알아야 돈이 모인다
피트니스센터 이용권 결제 시 먹튀에 대비해 영수증을 챙기자
통신사·신용카드 포인트를 1원도 허투루 버리지 않는 법
코로나19와 아시아나 M&amp;A, ‘내 마일리지’는 어쩌죠?
‘앗, 택시에 서류가방을’ 신용카드로 분실물 찾는 방법은?
주차장 붙박이 운전자와 초보 운전자를 위한 자동차보험은?

불황에 더 빛나는 예물 재테크, 순금 목걸이와 팔찌 세트 어때요?
13월의 월급을 챙기는 연말정산 4가지 전략

3장 내 인생의 최대 숙제인 ‘집’
전세계약이 2년 더 연장될까? 만약 집주인이 거주하겠다고 하면?
전세 낀 집을 살 때는 ‘세입자 계약 만료 시점’을 꼭 확인해야
육아문제로 부모와 집을 합치면 1주택자 비과세 혜택을 못 받나?

국내외 최초로 롱텀 디플레이션(LTD)을 본격 연구한 책이다. 디플레이션을 통상의 불경기인 숏텀 디플레이션과 롱텀 디플레이션으로 나눠서 설명하고 아무도 모르는 투자비법을 최초로 공개한다. 모든 재산들은 서로 관계가 있다는 사실을 FRED의 40~50년간의 같은 연월일의 데이터 즉 달러 환율과 주가지수, 주택지수, 금과 원유 등의 관계를 명쾌하게 설명한다.

딥러닝 기반 자연어 처리 기술을 체계적이고 쉽게 배울 수 있는 입문서다. 네이버 영화평, 뉴스 댓글, 질의응답 등 한국어 말뭉치로 실습해 국내 자연어 처리 연구가에게 더욱 효과적이며, 트랜스포머의 핵심 원리와 허깅페이스 패키지 활용법 등 최신 자연어 처리 기술의 진수를 담았다. 국내 대표 포털에서 자연어 처리를 연구하는 저자의 오랜 공력을 엿볼 수 있다.

1~3장에서는 트랜스포머와 전이 학습, BERT와 GPT의 핵심 동작 원리를 이해하고, 이를 바탕으로 4~8장에서는 감성 분석, 자연어 추론, 개체명 인식, 질의응답, 문장 생성 등 5가지 과제를 직접 수행해 본다. 실습 코드는 pytorch-lightning, 허깅페이스의 transformers 등 최신 오픈소스 라이브러리를 사용했다.

부동산문제를 해결하려면, 성경 희년법과 포도원 천국 비유의 시장원리대로 토지사용자가 세貰(토지임료)를 내는 지대시장제와 토지주식제를 해야 한다. 지대시장제는 “반값으로 내 땅, 내 집”, 세금까지 사라진다. 지대시장제는 100% 사유재산제와 시장자유가 보장되는 경제원리이다.

‘40일 토지 정탐’과 ‘40년 토지 실험’
사람에게 한 가지 더 부족한 것

일러두기

제1편
땅과 사람

제1장 가족의 기업과 부동산시장의 수수께끼
기업 무르기 이야기 / 부동산시장의 수수께끼 / 790만 원이 1억 원으로 / 사상 초유 ‘1억 원 내기토론’ 성사될까? / ‘1억 원 내기’는 아직도 유효합니다
제2장 땅값의 발견과 토지 예찬
[복숭아와 복숭아씨] &#x3D; [토지임료와 땅값] / 토지 예찬 / 만나와 오병이어 / 만나와 오병이어보다 더 큰 기적은 / 인간사人間史와 지구사地球史―사람이 경제적 땅(지구)을 보지 못한 혼돈의 세상사 / 땅값은 지구가격, 사람에게는 너무 크고 길어서… / 바닷물도 사용으로 줄일 수 없습니다 / 쓸 수 있는 상품가격과 쓸 수 없는 땅값
제3장 토지 무르기에서 찾아내는 인간 구원
구원이란? / 원죄原罪와 원빚原負債 / 몸값과 땅값은 빚 중의 빚입니다―땅값은 원빚原負債입니다 / 죄들은 사해지고, 빚들은 없애 버려야 합니다
부동산문제의 근본적 원인과 해법을 찾는 과학적 설명회 요청
처음에 / 땅값 이해를 위한 질문 / 땅값의 성질과 부동산문제의 근본 해법을 찾기 위한 설명회 요청

제2편
희년법의 재발견―속량의 원천·자유의 뿌리

제4장 성경의 희년법으로 들어가면서
레위기의 구조와 성경 희년법 / 희년법은 사유재산제와 시장경제의 원리입니다 / 희년법은 경제학이 풀어야 했습니다 / 성경 희년법은 시장경제의 신호등입니다
제5장 본문으로 소개하는 성경 희년법(토지 속량법)
안식년―땅은 사람처럼 일하고 쉬며, 사람이 없어도 스스로 산물을 내고 있다 / 희년―토지 무르기로 땅값(원빚)이 사라져서, 토지가 돌아오면, 백성들은 자유를 누린다 / 성경이 허용한 토지거래법 / 성경이 금지한 토지거래법 / 토지 무르기―토지 속량법, 무르기가 완성되면 자유가 최고로 보장되는 희년이 온다
제6장 레위기 희년법의 경제적 접근과 이해
땅에 대한 인간 오해―땅을 상품으로 보는 것은 인간의 과학적 오류 / 성경 토지법: 땅은 스스로 생산한다 / 성경 토지법: 토지는 생산될 열매의 연수를 따라 팔고 사라 / 성경 토지법: 토지는 영원히 팔리지 말라 / 성경 토지법: 토지를 시한부로 팔았으면(세를 놓았으면) 무르기를 하라 / 토지거래와 무...

대중에게 건설업은 어떤 이미지로 각인되고 있을까? 건설산업은 한국 경제 발전의 핵심 토대를 이루며, 성장을 견인하는 역할을 충실히 해왔다. 특히 1950년대 한국전쟁으로 폐허가 된 우리나라는 각종 기반시설의 구축, 주택 등을 비롯한 수많은 건축물의 건설을 통해 양적, 질적 성과를 이룩했다. 우리나라를 지금의 선진국 반열에 올려놓은 원동력의 중심에는 과거 건설산업이 있었다.

하지만 건설산업은 낮은 생산성과 수익성, 그리고 시대의 변화에 따르지 못하는 업계 관행 등으로 점차 국가 산업에서 점점 경쟁력을 잃어갔다. 특히 3D업종, 부실공사, 부정부패, 환경파괴, 담합, 폭리 등 일반 대중이 생각하는 건설업에 대한 부정적인 이미지는 건설산업이 성장하고 미래를 설계하는 데에 큰 걸림돌이 되고 있다. 건설업에 대한 부정적 이미지는 그저 인식으로만 그치는 것이 아니라, 산업현장에서는 일자리 기피 현상으로도 나타나고 있다.

《이코노컨스트럭션》의 저자는 우리나라 건설업이 걸어온 발자취를 들여다보며, 한국 경제에서 건설산업이 얼마나 큰 비중을 차지하고 또 국가 경제에 얼마만큼의 기여를 했는지 자세히 설명해준다. 전성기 건설업의 모습만을 조명하는 것은 아니다. 건설업이 경쟁력을 잃었던 원인 그리고 건설업의 어두운 면을 살펴봄으로써, 국가 경제의 큰 비중을 차지하는 건설업의 현재를 진단하고 더 나은 내일을 준비할 수 있도록 독려한다. [more...]

저소득층의 고통은 한층 커졌으며 집값은 천정부지로 뛰어 내 집 마련은 아무나 꿀 수 없는 꿈이 되고 말았다. 이렇게 무너진 한국경제를 다시 일으켜 세워야 하는 것은, 2022년 출범하는 새 정부의 숙명적 과제일 것이다. 이를 위해 국내 최고 경제정책 전문가 10인이 모여 ‘성장과 혁신’, ‘재정과 복지’, ‘부동산·금융·공정거래’, ‘노동, 저출산’ 등 9개의 어젠다를 제시한다. 

이 책에서는 정부가 추진해온 ‘소득주도성장론’과 ‘집값 안정 정책’은 실패했다고 분석하며, 경제의 기본 원리를 다시 복원해야 한다고 말한다. 저성장 극복 방안, 디지털시대의 혁신역량 강화, 국가 재정전략 수립, 주택시장 정상화 해법, 금융 산업과 서비스업의 경쟁력 제고, 초저출산 사회의 과제 등 한국경제를 정상궤도로 돌려놓기 위한 혁신전략을 담은 이 책은 대한민국의 경제 발전을 위한 가장 믿음직스러운 정책서가 되어줄 것이다.

급격한 기후변화와 코로나19로 인한 전 세계적 경제 충격으로 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 친환경적 움직임이 가속되고 있다. 전 세계 주요국은 친환경차 보급 확대를 지원하고 있으며, 이를 위한 인프라 구축에 많은 돈을 쏟아붓고 있다. 

자동차 산업과 직결되는 재생 에너지는 호시탐탐 기회를 엿보던 몇몇 국가의 새로운 성장 동력이 된 지 오래다. 또한 한국뿐 아니라 많은 나라에서 그린 뉴딜 정책으로 일자리를 창출해 코로나19로 인한 경제 침체를 극복하고자 한다. 즉 우리는 이러한 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 역학 관계에 주목할 필요가 있다.

대격변의 시대, 두 산업에서 투자자의 시선은 어디로 향할 것인가? 현대차증권의 장문수, 강동진 연구위원은 전 세계를 뒤바꿔놓을 거대한 흐름을 다각도로 분석한다. 주요국의 친환경차 관련 주요 정책 및 코로나19로 인한 경영 환경의 변화는 물론, 테슬라·도요타·폭스바겐 등 글로벌 모빌리티 기업의 친환경 대응 전략과 재생 에너지 기술의 핵심 역량을 조망한다. 이 책을 통해 에너지와 모빌리티 산업의 변화상을 들여다본다면 위기 속에서 새로운 기회를 잡을 수 있을 것이다.

‘부조리’, ‘불공정’, ‘불투명’에 맞서 싸우는 경제 전문가이자, 한국 경제 ‘팩트 저격수’로 잘 알려진 최배근 건국대 교수의 최신간. 그는 이 책에서 개혁 정부의 실패를 바라는 부패세력이 어떻게 경제적 사실을 왜곡하고, 부정적 여론으로 확산시키는지 풍부한 데이터를 통해 흥미롭게 분석한다. 

특히 ‘언론-포털-경제관료-야당’으로 이어지는 부패 기득권 카르텔에 주목하며, 그들이 어떻게 한국 경제를 ‘사익 추구’의 방편으로 활용하고 있는지 낱낱이 파헤친다. 모피아를 중심으로 한 경제관료들이 문재인 정부에서 ‘재정 안정’이라는 명목으로 소득주도성장, 부동산 세제 개편, 전 국민 재난지원금 지급 등의 개혁 정책에 맞서 ‘태업한’ 적나라한 증거들을 공개한다.

Prologue_ ‘그들’을 막지 못하면 대한민국의 진전은 없다 

I부. 경제 ‘지표’를 부정하는 사람들
 ― 문재인 정부 경제정책의 팩트

1. ‘나라를 거덜 낸 정권’은 어떻게 시작했나 _이명박, 박근혜의 유산
2. 문재인 정부는 무조건 옳지 않다?! _개혁 정부의 손발 묶기
3. 보수언론이 원하는 재정 투입은 따로 있다 _‘재정지출’을 막는 진짜 속내
4. 왜 ‘소득주도성장’은 멈춰 섰을까 _‘어공’의 미흡한 준비, ‘늘공’의 완강한 저항
__팩트 파인더: 소득주도성장은 계속돼야 한다
5. 2020년 부동산 폭등, 이미 예견된 것이다 _모피아와 언론의 합작품
6. 보수언론이 원하는 세상은 ‘모두가 좋은 세상’이 아니다 _사익을 취하는 자들
7. 절대로 일본을 이길 수 없다는 믿음 _아베의 경제침략을 이겨낸 이유
8. GDP 증가율 세계 1위에 담긴 진실 _K-방역과 K-민주주의

II부. K-방역이 실패해야 하는 사람들
 ― 경제 효과 너머의 가치 

1. 누가 K-방역을 흔드는가 _부패세력의 생존 방정식
2. “한국은 이미 선진국이다” _K-방역이 가져온 기저효과
3. 그들이 ‘전 국민’ 재난지원금을 막으려는 이유 _선별복지라는 위선
4. 방역과 경제 2마리의 토끼를 잡아야 한다 _새로운 경제 생태계
5. K-브랜드, K-민주주의의 기회가 되다 _우리가 만든 ‘문법’

III부. ‘부동산 폭등’을 즐기는 사람들
 ― 폭등 뒤에 숨은 검은 배후

1. ‘LH 사태’가 말해주는 것 _부패의 기원 
__팩트 파인더: 반칙과 특권에 기생하는 부동산-금융 카르텔
2. 문재인 정부 부동산 정책 실패의 기원 _예고된 신뢰 추락
3. 왜 민주 정부의 부동산 정책은 항상 실패하는가 _부동산 카르텔의 힘 

IV부. ‘재정안정주의’의 그늘에 숨은 사람들
 ― ‘모피아’ 관료들이 살아가는 방식 

1. ‘혁명의 언어’가 된 전 국민 재난지원금 _‘88%’의 비밀
2. 모피아가 재정지출에 반대하는 이유 _재정 사유화
__팩트 파인더: ‘나랏돈’이 쌓인다는데, 무엇이 문제일까?
3. 제2의 윤석열, 최재형은 계속된다 _언론, 검찰, 모피아
4. 경제관료 못 잡으면 ‘K-민주주의’ 없다 _‘늘공’ 통제 시스템
__팩트 파...

                    <span>Last summer’s mass mobilization for racial justice sparked debates around how to combat entrenched racial inequality in the United States. Recent corporate diversity initiatives, while a step in the right direction, are not sufficient to topple structural racism in the economy. One of the most striking dimensions of inequality in the United States is the […]

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.
