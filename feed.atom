        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper discusses contributions that industrial organization economists have made to our understanding of energy markets and environmental regulation. We emphasize the substantive contributions of recent papers while also highlighting how this literature has adopted and sometimes augmented theoretical and empirical tools from industrial organization. Many of the topics examined by this literature—especially auctions, investment, productivity and innovation, and regulation—also apply to a variety of settings beyond energy and the environment. We also indicate areas where future research is likely to be fruitful, with an emphasis on how industrial organization economists can help inform energy and environmental policies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Middlemen are ubiquitous in supply chains. In developing countries they help bring products from remote communities to end markets but may exert strong market power. We study a cooperative intervention which organizes together poor fishing communities in the Amazon — one of the poorest and most remote regions of the world — to purchase large boats in order to partially bypass middlemen and deliver their fish directly to market. We find that the intervention increases income by 27%, largely through an increase in price received, and also increases consumption. Moreover, the intervention is highly cost effective with the projected stream of income gains easily covering the cost of the investment. Finally, we formalize a model in which the market power of middlemen itself can create a poverty trap, which can be eliminated with cooperative investment.]]></summary>

I use an analytically tractable heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model that is parameterized so as to admit a bubble in public debt. In this context, I show that it is possible to stabilize either inflation or output in response to aggregate shocks by varying only fiscal policy (that is, lump-sum uniform transfers). In contrast, when the public debt bubble is large, it is impossible to stabilize either inflation or output by varying only interest rates (monetary policy). The theoretical analysis implies that, in the presence of a large public debt bubble, fiscal policy is a more reliable stabilization tool than monetary policy.]]></summary>

The agency evaluated neighborhoods using block-level information collected by New Deal relief programs and the Census in many cities.  The FHA’s exclusionary pattern predates the advent of the infamous maps later made by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) and shows little change after the drafting of those maps.  In contrast, the HOLC itself broadly loaned to such neighborhoods and to Black homeowners.  We conclude that the HOLC’s redlining maps had little effect on the geographic distribution of either program’s mortgage market activity, and that the FHA crafted and implemented its own redlining methodology prior to the HOLC.]]></summary>

Regulatory forbearance incentivizes banks to both retain risky loans and reject new good opportunities.

We consider a search model where referral networks are segregated, firms are more informed about the match quality of referred candidates, and some referrals are made by non-referred employees. Consistent with the model, we find that firms are more likely to hire candidates and less likely to dismiss employees of the same race as the founder, but these differences diminish as firms' cumulative hires increase. Referral hiring helps to explain racial differences in dismissals, seniority, and employer size.]]></summary>

We demonstrate how advancements in satellite imagery and machine learning can help ameliorate these data and inference challenges. In the context of an expansion of the electrical grid across Uganda, we show how a combination of satellite imagery and computer vision can be used to develop local-level livelihood measurements appropriate for inferring the causal impact of electricity access on livelihoods. We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by 0.17 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate over our study period relative to untreated areas.  Our results provide country-scale evidence on the impact of a key infrastructure investment, and provide a low-cost, generalizable approach to future policy evaluation in data sparse environments.]]></summary>

We document that the current bidding process, which grants priority based on seniority, results in the assignment of more experienced officers to less violent and high-income neighborhoods. Our empirical model combines estimates of heterogeneous officer preferences underlying the bidding process with causal estimates of the effects of officer experience on neighborhood crime. Equalizing officer seniority across districts would reduce violent crime rate by 4.6 percent and significantly decrease inequality in crime, discretionary arrests, and officer use of force across neighborhoods. Moreover, this assignment can be achieved in a revenue-neutral way while resulting in small welfare gains for police officers, implying that it is more equitable and efficient.]]></summary>

The increases are largely borne by those without a four-year college degree—the majority of American adults. For many less-educated Americans, the economy and society are no longer providing the basis for a good life. Concurrently, all-cause mortality in the US is diverging by education—falling for the college-educated and rising for those without a degree—something not seen in other rich countries. We review the rising prevalence of pain, despair, and suicide among Americans without a BA. Pain and despair created a baseline demand for opioids, but the escalation of addiction came from pharma and its political enablers. We examine “the politics of despair,” how less-educated people have abandoned and been abandoned by the Democratic Party. While healthier states once voted Republican in presidential elections, now the least-healthy states do. We review the evidence on whether or not deaths of despair have risen during the COVID pandemic. More broadly, excess mortality from COVID has not increased the ratio of all-cause mortality rates for those with and without a four-year degree, but has instead replicated the pre-existing mortality ratio.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using new large-scale survey and experimental data, we investigate how respondents perceive racial inequities between Black and white Americans, what they believe causes them, and what interventions, if any, they think should be implemented to reduce them. We intentionally oversample Black respondents, cover many cities in the US, and survey both adults and very young people aged 13 to 17. In the experimental parts, we consider the causal impact of information on racial inequities (such as the evolution of the Black-white earnings gap or the differences in mobility for Black and white children) and explanations for these inequities (i.e., the deep-seated roots and long-lasting consequences of systemic racism) on respondents' views. Although there is heterogeneity in how respondents perceive the magnitude of current racial gaps in economic conditions and opportunities, the biggest discrepancies are in how they explain them. There is a stark partisan gap among white respondents, particularly in the perceived causes of racial inequities and what should be done about them. White Democrats and Black respondents are much more likely to attribute racial inequities to adverse past and present circumstances and want to act on them with race-targeted and general redistribution policies. At the same time, white Republicans are more likely to attribute racial gaps to individual actions. These views are already deeply entrenched in teenagers based on their race and their parents' political affiliation. A policy decomposition shows that the perceived causes of racial inequities correlate most strongly with support for race-targeted or general redistribution policies, a finding confirmed by the experimental results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This essay discusses several potential economic, political and social costs of the current path of AI technologies. I argue that if AI continues to be deployed along its current trajectory and remains unregulated, it may produce various social, economic and political harms. These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research. Attempts to contain them just by promoting competition may be insufficient.]]></summary>

We propose using parametric models for the treatment effects, as opposed to parametric models for the full outcome distributions. This leads to semiparametric models for the outcome distributions. We derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for this setting, and propose efficient estimators. In the case with a constant treatment effect one of the proposed estimators has an interesting interpretation as a weighted average of quantile treatment effects, with the weights proportional to (minus) the second derivative of the log of the density of the potential outcomes. Our analysis also results in an extension of Huber's model and trimmed mean to include asymmetry and a simplified condition on linear combinations of order statistics, which may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of omnichannel retail, some brands open a flagship store at online marketplaces, while others avert it. Focusing on a large e-commerce platform, we empirically study how flagship entry affects consumers, the platform, and various sellers on the platform. 
We find flagship entry may benefit consumers by expanding the choice set, by intensifying price competition within the entry brand, and by improving consumer perception for parts of the platform. In the meantime, flagship entry cannibalizes the sales of same-brand sellers, while other brands may gain as the buyer base expands on the platform. 
Counterfactual simulation suggests that flagship entry improves the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the platform but hurts existing sellers of the entry brand. On average, the effect on consumer welfare is more positive if the flagship entry is from a non-prominent brand than from a prominent brand, because consumers tend to lower their willingness to pay for individual sellers upon a prominent flagship entry. In hypothetical scenarios where flagship entry were accompanied by constraints on other same-brand sellers, the reduced competition would benefit the flagship store but hurt consumers.]]></summary>

This paper studies carbon taxation using an 18-region, 80- period overlapping generations model. We focus on carbon policy that delivers present and future mankind the highest uniform percentage welfare gain. The policy combines global carbon taxation and region- and generation-specific net transfers. In our main calibration, uniform welfare-improving carbon tax policy can make those agents already here and those yet to come, no matter their location, 4.35 percent better off. Achieving (such) equal proportionate gains, which may be needed for universal support, requires major interregional as well as intergenerational transfers. Universal support, though, is not essential. For example, even absent participation by China, whose projected carbon emissions are massive, the rest of the world can still materially limit the carbon externality. However, absent China, their optimal carbon tax is roughly half as large, and the uniform welfare-improving gain is less than three-fifths as large.]]></summary>

We investigate this question for the case of Turkey, which undertook a large-scale public investment in roads during the 2000s. Using spatially disaggregated data on road upgrades and domestic transactions, we estimate a large positive impact of reduced travel times on trade as well as local manufacturing employment and wages. A quantitative exercise using a workhorse model of spatial equilibrium implies heterogeneous effects across locations, with aggregate real income gains reaching 2-3 percent in the long-run. Reductions in travel times increased local employment-to-population ratio but had no effect on local population. We extend the model by endogenizing the labor supply decision to capture this finding. The model-implied elasticity of employment rates to travel time reductions captures about one-third of the empirical elasticity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate the source, magnitude, and unevenness of the procyclical forces that shape labor force participation, i.e., the participation cycle, which are important for the implementation of the maximum employment mandate. We show that these forces can be analyzed in real time using a flow decomposition of the changes in the labor force participation rate. The decomposition reveals that the source of the participation cycle is fluctuations in job-loss and job-finding rates, rather than cyclical movements in labor force entry and exit rates. The magnitude of the participation cycle is large. Cyclical downward pressures on employment from participation are two-thirds that of unemployment. Moreover, the participation cycle delays the recovery in employment because it lags the unemployment cycle. It also amplifies the unevenness of the impact of recessions. Groups that see large increases in their unemployment rates also experience more pronounced participation cycles. Despite differences in their magnitudes, the source of the participation cycle is the same for all groups. Application of our method to the COVID-19 Recession suggests that, as of June 2021, the bulk of the drop in the participation rate since the onset of the pandemic is cyclical and that the cyclical recovery in participation likely will trail that of the unemployment rate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the effects of going public using a unique panel of firms in 16 European countries for which we observe financial data before and after firms' initial-public-offering (IPO) attempts. We compare firms that complete their IPO with firms that withdraw their IPO. We instrument the going public decision using prior market returns. We find that firm profitability goes up after going public—contrary to previous results in the literature. We also find an post-IPO expansion in the number of subsidiaries and countries in which IPO firms operate. Our results are stronger for firms in financially dependent industries and in countries with higher investor protection consistent with going public relaxing financial constraints and with a stronger impact when agency conflicts are lower.  Overall, our results are consistent with going public inducing a shift towards a strategy of commercialization to increase profitability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I study a general equilibrium menu cost model with a continuum of sectors, idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, and the novel feature that each sector consists of strategically engaged firms. Compared to an economy with monopolistically competitive sectors—separately parameterized to match the same microdata on price flexibility—the oligopoly economy features a smaller response of inflation to monetary shocks and output responses that are more than twice as large. Under the same parameters, output responses are five times larger. An oligopoly economy also (i) requires smaller menu costs and idiosyncratic shocks to match the microdata, addressing a significant challenge for mechanisms that generate non-neutrality via strategic complementarities, (ii) implies four times larger welfare losses from same sized nominal rigidities, and (iii) provides a novel rationale for positive menu costs: in an oligopoly firms prefer a degree of rigidity to complete flexibility. Quantitatively, the estimated degree of nominal rigidity is found to be close to optimal, from firms’ perspective.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canonical human capital theories posit that education, by enhancing worker skills, reduces the likelihood that a worker will be laid-off during times of economic change. Yet, this has not been demonstrated causally. We link administrative education records from 1987 through 2002 to nationally representative surveys conducted before and after COVID-19 onset in Barbados to explore the causal impact of improved education on job loss during this period. Using a regression discontinuity (RD) design, Beuermann and Jackson (2020) show that females (but not males) who score just above the admission threshold for more selective schools in Barbados attain more years of education than those that scored just below (essentially holding initial ability fixed). Here, in follow-up data, we show that these same females (but not males) are much less likely to have lost a job after the onset of COVID-19. We show that these effects are not driven by sectoral changes, or changes in labor supply. Because employers observe incumbent worker productivity, these patterns are inconsistent with pure education signalling, and suggest that education enhances worker skill.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why are certain communities more prone to anti-government protests than others? Do past rebellions lead to more protests today? We study the historical roots of social unrest using the experience of China. We document that counties with higher incidence of peasant uprisings against local government officials during the Qing dynasty period (1644-1912) also have higher incidence of anti-government protests in present-day China. To generate plausibly exogenous variation in the incidence of past protests, we exploit differences in the visibility and magnitude of solar eclipses during the Qing dynasty period. In the Confucian tradition, solar eclipses are considered a negative divine signal on the legitimacy of the ruler, facilitating the coordination of protest actions. We test this mechanism using detailed data on the timing and location of anti-government rebellions extracted from local chronicles. Counties within the totality zone of a solar eclipse were significantly more likely to experience a rebellion in the eclipse year. Leaders of early anti-Qing rebellions were recorded in popular culture and celebrated in temples, favoring the transmission of the memory of their actions across generations. The persistent effect of past protests is stronger in counties with such temples and memorials, consistent with a long-term memory of revolutions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper develops a 17-region, 3-skill group, overlapping generations, computable general equilibrium model to evaluate the global consequences of automation. Automation, modeled as capital- and high-skill biased technological change, is endogenous with regions adopting new technologies when profitable. Our approach captures and quantifies key macro implications of a range of foundational models of automation. In our baseline scenario, automation has a moderate effect on regional outputs and a small effect on world interest rates. However, it has a major impact on inequality, both wage inequality within regions and per capita GDP inequality across regions. We examine two policy responses to technological change -- mandating use of the advanced technology and providing universal basic income to share gains from automation. The former policy can raise a region's output, but at a welfare cost. The latter policy can transform automation into a win-win for all generations in a region.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asset prices are a valuable source of information about financial market participants' expectations about key macroeconomic variables. However, the presence of time-varying risk premia requires an adjustment of market prices to obtain the market's rational assessment of future price and policy developments. This paper reviews empirical approaches for recovering market-based expectations. It starts by laying out the two canonical modeling frameworks that form the backbone for estimating risk premia and highlights the proliferation of risk pricing factors that result in a wide range of different asset-price-based expectation measures. It then describes a key methodological innovation to evaluate the empirical plausibility of risk premium estimates and to identify the most accurate market-based expectation measure. The usefulness of this general approach is illustrated for price expectations in the global oil market. Then, the paper provides an overview of the body of empirical evidence for monetary policy and inflation expectations with a special emphasis on market-specific characteristics that complicate the quest for the best possible market-based expectation measure. Finally, it discusses a number of economic applications where market expectations play a key role for evaluating economic models, guiding policy analysis, and deriving shock measures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper analyses the effect of a firm’s organizational capacity on the reported profitability of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Better organizational practices improve productivity and the potential taxable profits of firms. However, higher adoption of these practices may also enable more efficient allocation of profits across tax jurisdictions, lowering actual taxable profits. We present new evidence that MNE subsidiaries with better such practices, when located in high-tax countries, report significantly lower profits and have a higher incidence of bunching around zero returns on assets. We show these results are driven by patterns consistent with profit-shifting behavior. Further, using an event study design, we find that firms with better practices are more responsive to corporate tax rate changes. Our results suggest organizational capacity, especially monitoring-related practices, enables firms to engage in shifting profits away from their high-tax subsidiaries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk often inhibits on-farm investment by smallholder farmers. Recent evidence indicates that index insurance and stress tolerant seeds can separately and partially offset this risk effect. In this study, we explore whether the complementarities between these two risk management technologies can be harnessed to underwrite a resilient, high productivity small farm sector. Utilizing a multi-year randomized control trial that spanned two countries and exploits natural variation in weather shocks, we find that drought tolerant maize seeds mitigate the impact of mid-season drought. Compared to farms in control villages, where shocks have persistent effects that reduce future investment and productivity, those with access to both drought tolerant seeds and multi-peril index insurance show greater resilience and immediately bounce back from shocks. Experiential learning is key to realizing this resilience effect: Farmers who experienced shocks intensify their subsequent use of the technologies and exhibit what we call resilience-plus, while those who did not experience shocks disadopt. Together these findings showcase important complementarities between these risk mitigating technologies and the crucial role learning plays in tapping their potential stochastic and dynamic benefits to small farmers.]]></summary>

Net income totaled $70.4 billion, an increase of $51.9 billion (281 percent) from the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $73 billion (117.3 percent) decline in provision expense.
...
Total loan and lease balances increased $33.2 billion (0.3 percent) from the previous quarter. This was the first quarterly increase in loan volume since second quarter 2020. An increase in credit card loan balances (up $30.9 billion, or 4.1 percent), supplemented by an increase in auto loan balances (up $18.9 billion, or 3.8 percent), drove the growth.
Loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status (i.e., noncurrent loans) continued to decline (down $13.2 billion, or 10.8 percent) from first quarter 2021. The noncurrent rate for total loans declined 12 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.01 percent. Net charge-offs also continued to decline (down $8.3 billion, or 53.2 percent) from a year ago. The total net charge-off rate dropped 30 basis points to 0.27 percent—the lowest level on record.

The FDIC reported the number of problem banks declined by four from the first quarter to 51.
This graph from the FDIC shows the number of problem banks and assets at 51 institutions.
Note: The number of assets for problem banks increased significantly back in 2018 when Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas was added to the list (it must still be on the list given the assets of problem banks).
The dollar value of 1-4 family residential Real Estate Owned (REOs, foreclosure houses) declined from $1.73 billion in Q2 2020 to $0.85 billion in Q2 2021.  This is the lowest level of REOs in many years.  (probably declined sharply due to foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance programs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.
The occupancy rate was unchanged compared to the same week in 2019 due to Labor Day demand and Hurricane Ida.

From CoStar: Labor Day Demand, Hurricane Ida Evacuations Reverse Five-Week US Hotel Occupancy Slide
Labor Day weekend leisure travel and Hurricane Ida-related demand lifted U.S. hotel occupancy out of a five-week slump.
After declining for the past five weeks, weekly U.S. hotel occupancy inched up 30 basis points for the week ending Sept. 4 to 61.3%, according to the latest data from CoStar hospitality analytics firm STR.  Weekend occupancy, Friday and Saturday, increased to 77%, which was the country’s highest since the first week of August.
Compared with Labor Day weekend in 2019, which was a week earlier, occupancy was nearly the same, indicating the desire to travel remains strong despite the increase in COVID-19 cases, and occupancy declines over the past several weeks are more due to the return of in-person schools and the slow materialization of business and group travel.
emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, occupancy has been declining due to both seasonal factors and the "pandemic situation".
Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - usually weekly occupancy increases up to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.]]></summary>

This data is as of September 7th.
From Black Knight: Forbearances Decrease
The number of active forbearance plans fell by 92K (-5.4%) this week, driven by lingering August expirations and new activity taking place in September.
Volumes fell significantly across all investor classes, with portfolio/PLS plans seeing the greatest decline at 40K (-7.7%). Plans were also down 26K among both FHA/VA and GSE loans, for -3.8% and -5.1% declines, respectively. Overall, plan volumes are now down 129K (-7.4%) from the same time last month and have fallen by 3.1M (-67%) from their peak in May 2020.
Additional activity is expected later in the month as well, with nearly 540K plans still scheduled for review for extension/removal in September. Of those, nearly 400K are set to reach their final plan expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

Significant volume declines could still be seen in coming weeks as those plans reach their final expirations and exiting borrowers return to making mortgage payments in October.

팬데믹 이후 세계는 각종 품귀 현상에 꾸준히 시달리고 있다. 마스크를 구매하기 위해 긴 줄을 선 사람들은 물론, 소독제와 화장지 등 공산품에 대한 품귀현상이 있었고, 원재료가 없어 반도체나 자동차 공장이 셧다운을 맞기도 했다. 최근에는 어떤 백신을 얼마나 수급할 것인지가 모두의 관심사이다. 이전의 많은 팬데믹도 마찬가지지만, 코로나19는 특히 우리 모두가 서로에게 의존하고 있음을 증명해주었다. 한 사람은, 나아가 하나의 기업과 국가는 결코 독단적으로 생존할 수 없다.

현 MIT 교수인 요시 셰피는 서플라이 체인 분야의 세계적 석학이자 선구자이다. 특히 서플라이 체인에 대한 학술적 전문성과 함께 직접 기업을 운영해온 실무적인 지식을 더한 경력을 바탕으로 회복탄력성(리질리언스)을 강조하며 기업의 유연한 대처를 강조왔다. 이 책에는 불확실하고 예측할 수 없는 포스트 팬데믹 시대를 기회로 전환한 세계 기업의 사례가 설명되어 있다.

앞으로도 새로운 팬데믹의 발생이나 정치적 불안정, 기후 변화 및 자원 고갈 등 수많은 문제가 기업의 생존을 위협할 가능성은 높다. 그러나 이 책이 제시하는 프레임워크와 여러 사례가 다음에 닥칠 위기에 맞서 번창하는 데 도움을 줄 것이다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tracking new cases, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID, mostly to assess the impact on the economy.
Just over a month ago, many Americans, and economic analysts, assumed COVID was mostly behind us. Unfortunately they were wrong, and COVID has impacted the economic outlook once again.
For example, on July 30th, Goldman Sachs wrote: "we are launching our Q3 GDP tracking estimate at +9.0% (qoq ar)"
Then in mid-August, they downgraded their forecast: "We have lowered our Q3 GDP forecast to +5.5%, reflecting hits to both consumer spending and production."
And this week, on September 6th, they downgraded their forecast again: “We now expect GDP growth of 3.5% in Q3."  That is about one third of the real growth they expected just 5 weeks ago!
Other analysts have made similar downgrades for Q3.  There are several reasons for the change: the surge in COVID cases has impacted some consumer spending, supply chain disruptions are ongoing (and COVID is impacting the supply chain recovery), and possibly some downgrades due to policy (expiration of unemployment benefits during a COVID wave).

Right now it is looking like new cases are peaking, but far above the 12,000 per day level we saw in June.   And it looks like we might see another Winter wave for several reasons:


1) There is a huge reservoir of virus (about 150,000 new cases have been reported per day).


2) Schools are reopening, and kids spread the virus easily.


3) Many Americans have moved past taking even the easiest mitigation efforts (like wearing masks indoors).


4) Only 53.4% of Americans are vaccinated, and the percent is increasing very slowly.


5) Thanksgiving is only 77 days from now (followed by Christmas and New Years).  Families will want to gather in person this year.  


A severe winter COVID wave could be a significant economic drag in Q4, and Q1 2022.  And the most vulnerable are losing their extended unemployment benefits, and could be facing eviction.  Hopefully there won't be another wave.  Best to all]]></summary>

The Dodge Momentum Index dropped 3% in August to 148.7 (2000=100) from the revised July reading of 154.0. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Data & Analytics, is a monthly measure of the first (or initial) report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year.
The commercial planning component lost 2% in August, while the institutional component fell by 6%.
Projects entering the earliest stages of planning have declined following the torrid pace set in the spring. The decline in August was the third consecutive drop in the Momentum Index, which is now off 14% from the most recent high in May, since May the commercial component is down 10% and the institutional component is 22% lower. This reversal comes as prices for materials used in nonresidential buildings increase in combination with a shortage of labor and a rising number of new COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant, all working in concert to undermine confidence in the fledgling construction recovery. There were some pockets of strength in August, however, as more data center, education and warehouse projects moved into planning relative to the prior month. Additionally, the overall level of the Momentum Index is 19% higher than one year ago; institutional planning was up 17% and commercial planning was 20% higher than last year.

This graph shows the Dodge Momentum Index since 2002. The index was at 148.7 in August, down from 154.0 in July.
According to Dodge, this index leads "construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year".  This index suggests a decline in Commercial Real Estate construction through most of 2021, but perhaps a pickup towards the end of the year, and growth in 2022 (even with the decline in the August index).]]></summary>

PHP나 프로그래밍의 기초를 배우고자 하는 초보자용으로, 문장보다는 이미지를 전면에 내세워 설명하고 있다. 캐릭터 베이스의 프로그램을 작성함으로써 PHP의 개념의 확실한 이해 도모를 목적으로 하고 있다. 그리고 일러스트와 그림을 많이 사용하고 있으므로 단순히 문장으로만 설명하는 것보다 이미지 전달이 더 정확할 것이다.

2017년 한국은 이미 1인당 국민소득 3만 달러를 넘었지만 이후 횡보하고 있다. 저성장의 고착화가 그 배경이다. 저자들은 저성장과 일자리 부족의 원인을 직업 간 과도한 보상격차와 비싼 부동산가격으로 인한 고비용구조로 일목요연하게 설명한다. 그리고 지속 성장과 일자리 창출을 위한 중요 과제를 구체적으로 제시한다. 정책의 실현 가능성을 높이기 위한 방안도 적시하고 있다.

부동산 불패의 신화는 언제까지 계속될 것인가? 문재인 정부는 출범 초기부터 부동산시장 안정화를 최우선 과제 중 하나로 내세워 여러 대책을 쏟아냈지만 그때마다 이를 비웃기라도 하듯 부동산가격은 오히려 급등하기만 했다. 열심히 돈 모아 집을 산다는 예전 식의 내 집 마련은 그야말로 꿈이 되어버렸고, 정부의 약속대로 ‘사는 것’이 아닌 ‘사는 곳’을 바랐던 서민들의 박탈감은 그만큼 더욱 커져만 가고 있다. 

그런데 아이러니한 것은 무주택자뿐만 아니라 집값 폭등으로 큰 이득을 본 1주택자도, 다주택자도 이 상황이 만족스럽지 않다는 것이다. 집 없는 사람은 집을 사기는커녕 빌려 사는 것조차 녹록지 않아 난리고, 집 있는 사람은 시세 차익 환수에 따른 세금 부담으로 난리다. 또 하나의 아이러니는 부동산과 관련한 각종 통계 지표와 국민들의 체감 현실 사이에 상당한 괴리가 있다는 것이다. 

대표적인 국제 주택시장 비교 사이트인 ‘글로벌 프로퍼티 가이드’와 OECD 등의 가격 변동 통계에 따르면, 우리나라의 집값 상승률은 평균적으로 다른 나라들보다 낮은 편이다. 특히 OECD 국가 중에서는 일본과 함께 하위권을 형성하고 있다. 물론 비교 기준의 문제로 논란이 있긴 하지만, 단지 ‘통계의 함정’으로만 치부할 수는 없는 노릇이다. 이를 어떻게 보아야 할까? 좀 더 거시적이고 냉철한 비교 연구가 요구되는 시점이다.

Economic growth downshifted slightly to a moderate pace in early July through August.

The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in a few cases, international travel restrictions.

The number of job openings increased to a series high of 10.9 million on the last business day of July,  the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires and total separations were little changed at 6.7  million and 5.8 million, respectively. Within separations, the quits rate was unchanged at 2.7 percent  while the layoffs and discharges rate was little changed at 1.0 percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for July, the most recent employment report was for August.

Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spikes in layoffs and discharges in March  2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings increased in July to 10.934 million from 10.185 million in June.  This is a new record high for this series.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 63% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 25% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for "quits").]]></summary>

Mortgage applications decreased 1.9 percent from one  week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage  Applications Survey for the week ending September 3, 2021.
... The Refinance Index decreased 3 percent from the previous  week and was 4 percent lower than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase  Index decreased 0.2 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 3 percent compared with the previous week and was 18 percent lower than the same week one year ago.
  
“Mortgage application volume fell last week to its lowest level since mid-July, as mortgage rates have  stayed just above 3% for several weeks. Refinance volume has been moderating, while purchase volume  continues to be lower than expected given the lack of homes on the market,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's  Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “Economic data has sent mixed signals, with slower job  growth but a further drop in the unemployment rate in August. We expect that further improvements will  lead to a tapering of Fed MBS purchases by the end of the year, which should put some upward pressure  on mortgage rates.” 
   ...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances  ($548,250 or less) remained unchanged at 3.03 percent, with points decreasing to 0.33 from 0.34 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

국토 면적으로는 우리의 96배, 인구로는 27배나 되는, 중국이라는 거대한 나라를 한눈에 이해하기란 매우 어렵다. 특히나 지역 간 발전 격차가 큰 탓에 자칫하면 평균의 함정에 빠질 수밖에 없다. 중국 경제를 제대로 알기 위해 반드시 지역별 연구가 뒷받침되어야 하는 이유다. 

이런 관점에서 놀라운 성장을 거듭해온 광둥성은 중국 경제의 현재와 미래를 가늠하는 데 최적의 지역이라 할 수 있다. 실제로 광둥성은 중국 대외개방 역사의 중심지로 적극적인 개혁개방 정책과 수출 전략으로 중국 내에서 32년간 GDP 1위를 차지해왔으며, 광둥성 언론들은 곧 한국의 GDP를 추월할 것이라고 장담하고 있다.

이 책은 중국 산업과 기술의 혁신 현황을 가장 빠르게 보여주는 광둥성을 자세히 들여다보며 중국의 경쟁력이 어디에서 비롯되고 있는지를 밝히고자 한다. 특히 광저우에서 선전을 거쳐 홍콩으로 이어지는 지역을 ‘차이나 실리콘밸리’라고 이름 붙이고, 직접 찾아가 보고 들은 중국 4차 산업혁명의 현장을 담고 있다.   
사실 한국에서 중국에 대한 관심은 베이징과 상하이를 넘지 못하는 경우가 많다. 이 책은 중국 경제의 바로미터라 할 수 있는 광둥성 경제를 3년간 가장 가까이서, 가장 깊게 들여다볼 수 있었던 경험을 통해 베이징과 상하이라는 좁은 시각에서 벗어나 진짜 중국 경제의 현재와 미래를 묻고 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Begin The Week Slightly Higher
Mortgage rates moved slightly higher to begin the holiday-shortened week.  ... The damage is minimal in the bigger picture.  On average, lenders are quoting the same rates seen last week, but with slightly higher closing costs today.  Most of the weakness in the underlying bond market is centered on US Treasuries as opposed to the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that serve as the foundation for mortgage rates.  The Treasury-specific weakness is likely due to the presence of several big Treasury auctions this week in addition to heavy corporate bond issuance (which tends to hurt Treasuries more than MBS).

컴퓨터 비전공자들이 전문 프로그래머나 통계 전문가의 도움을 빌리지 않고도 간단한 프로그래밍 도구를 사용하여 현실의 각종 데이터를 처리할 수 있는 방법을 소개하는 교재다. 우선 프로그래밍 도구로는 프로그램을 기술하는 방법 자체가 사람의 사고 체계와 유사하고 문법이 매우 단순한 파이썬을 택해 누구나 쉽게 프로그래밍에 친숙해지도록 한다.

파이썬이라는 프로그래밍 언어의 문법을 익히는 일에 중점을 두지 않고, 우리가 전자계산기의 사용법을 익히듯이 직관적인 몇 가지 파이썬 라이브러리 사용법을 배움으로써 데이터 처리 도구로서 파이썬을 사용할 수 있도록 한다. 이를 위해 직접 프로그램을 짜는 일을 최소화하고 다양한 공개 패키지들을 활용하는 방법을 배울 수 있다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Northwest Multiple Listing Service reported Northwest MLS brokers say August housing activity follows patterns of seasonal slowing
August typically brings a dip in housing activity and this year was no different, according to representatives from Northwest Multiple Listing Service when commenting on newly-released statistics. Figures comparing July to August show month-to-month drops in new listings, total inventory, pending sales, close sales, and median prices.
"August showed a more traditional seasonal pattern with decreased activity as families took end-of-summer vacations and made back-to-school preparations," remarked Frank Wilson, Kitsap regional manager and branch managing broker at John L. Scott Real Estate.
...
NWMLS statistics show the volume of new listings added during August, including single family homes and condominiums, declined from both July (down 11.5%) and twelve months ago (down 4.2%). Total inventory for the 26 counties in the report also fell, shrinking about 6.6% from July and nearly 22.6% from a year ago. At month end, there were 7,425 active listings, down from the year-ago total of 9,591.
emphasis added
The press release is for the Northwest MLS area.  There were 10,571 closed sales in August 2021, up 7.4% from 9,847 sales in July 2020.  Active inventory for the Northwest was down 22.6%.
In Seattle, sales were up 10.1% year-over-year, and inventory was down 43.9% year-over-year.  This puts the months-of-supply in Seattle at just 0.40 months.]]></summary>

There were supply constraints over the last year, for example, sawmills cut production and inventory at the beginning of the pandemic, and the West Coast fires in 2020 damaged privately-owned timberland (and maybe again in 2021).  


The supply constraints have eased somewhat.

현재 전 세계에서 가장 영향력 있는 대표적 경제학자 중 한 명인 폴 크루그먼은, 국내 일반 독자들에게도 낯설지 않다. 1997년 발생한 아시아 외환위기를 사전에 예측하면서 국내에 널리 알려지게 되었고,  <뉴욕타임스>의 고정 칼럼니스트로서 현실 경제 문제에 대한 예리한 진단과 함께 정부 정책에 대한 날선 비판을 하는 그는, 스스로를 ‘현대적 진보주의자’로 부르며 현실 문제에 적극 발언하는 실천적 지식인이다. 크루그먼은 재화와 노동시장의 불안정성을 전제하며 정부 당국의 일정한 개입을 정당화하는 신케인즈주의자로 분류되고 있다.

크루그먼의 책은 국내에 20여 종 번역되어 있으나 정작 그가 어떤 성과를 인정받아 2008년 노벨 경제학상을 받았는지에 대해서는 국내에 잘 알려지지 않았다. 그의 이론이 규모의 경제와 소비자 선호의 다양성을 바탕으로 무역의 패턴과 경제활동의 지리적 분포를 설명하였다는 게 당시 수상의 이유였고, 그것이 이 책 《폴 크루그먼의 지리경제학》의 주제이다.

매일 같은 일상을 살다 보면 자신도 모르게 삶의 테두리가 줄어든다. 만나는 사람만 만나고 다니는 곳만 다니는데 심지어 유튜브 알고리즘조차 끝없이 비슷한 주제의 영상들만 추천한다. 학교에 다닐 때는 원하지 않아도 다양한 분야의 지식을 접했지만 성인이 된 후에는 관심사의 범위를 넓히기가 쉽지 않다. 그러다 보니 생각의 크기 또한 협소해지는 것이 당연하다. 

‘지금의 교양’ 시리즈는 일상적으로 사용하지만 정확한 의미를 알기 어려웠던 각 분야의 50가지 키워드를 선정해 간결하고 정확하게 설명함으로써 세부적인 것에서 출발해 전체를 보는 눈을 길러준다. 50개 키워드 하나하나가 모여 큰 틀의 지도가 완성된다. 낱낱의 지식을 쌓고 생각의 외연을 확장함으로써 지금 이 시대 내 삶에 꼭 필요한 교양을 쌓도록 돕는다.   

‘지금의 교양’ 시리즈 첫 책은 『당신이 꼭 알아야 할 자본주의 키워드 50』이다. 런던 킹스칼리지의 경제학과 교수이자 경제 전문가 조너선 포티스가 자본주의를 구성하는 50가지 핵심 키워드를 통해 자본주의란 무엇이며, 어떻게 그 안에서 사회, 문화, 역사가 촘촘하게 연결되고 발전해왔는지를 설명한다. 자본주의는 오늘날 세계 대부분 국가의 경제 체제이며 이미 우리 사회 곳곳에 스며들어 있다. 세금, 최저임금, 실업, 집값, 대출 같은 일상의 대…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tracking existing home inventory will be very important this year.
Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of September 3rd, inventory was at 437 thousand (7 day average), compared to 584 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 25.1%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 54%.


A week ago, inventory was at 431 thousand, and was down 27.1% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 42.7% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of 158 thousand, or about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we'd normally expect, however inventory has increased 131 thousand (close to normal).


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent policy debate on minimum wages has focused not only on raising the minimum wage, but on eliminating the tip credit for restaurant workers. We use data on past variation in tip credits – or minimum wages for restaurant workers – to provide evidence on the potential impacts of eliminating (or reducing) the tip credit. Our evidence points to higher tipped minimum wages (smaller tip credits) reducing jobs among tipped restaurant workers, without earnings effects on those who remain employed sufficiently large to raise total earnings in this sector. And most of our evidence provides no indication that higher tipped minimum wages would be well targeted to poor or low-income families or reduce the likelihood of being poor or very low income.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although there is a large gap between Black and White American life expectancies, the gap fell 48.9% between 1990-2018, mainly due to mortality declines among Black Americans. We examine age-specific mortality trends and racial gaps in life expectancy in rich and poor U.S. areas and with reference to six European countries. 
Inequalities in life expectancy are starker in the U.S. than in Europe. In 1990 White Americans and Europeans in rich areas had similar overall life expectancy, while life expectancy for White Americans in poor areas was lower.  But since then even rich White Americans have lost ground relative to Europeans. Meanwhile, the gap in life expectancy between Black Americans and Europeans decreased by 8.3%.  
Black life expectancy increased more than White life expectancy in all U.S. areas, but improvements in poorer areas had the greatest impact on the racial life expectancy gap. The causes that contributed the most to Black mortality reductions included: Cancer, homicide, HIV, and causes originating in the fetal or infant period.  
Life expectancy for both Black and White Americans plateaued or slightly declined after 2012, but this stalling was most evident among Black Americans even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. If improvements had continued at the 1990-2012 rate, the racial gap in life expectancy would have closed by 2036. European life expectancy also stalled after 2014. Still, the comparison with Europe suggests that mortality rates of both Black and White Americans could fall much further across all ages and in both rich and poor areas.]]></summary>

We characterize optimal allocation rules when individual preferences are known and when they are not. Several insights emerge. First-best allocations may involve assigning some agents "lotteries" between high- and low-ranked goods. When preference intensities are private information, second-best allocations always involve such lotteries and, crucially, may coincide with first-best allocations. Furthermore, second-best allocations may entail disposal of services. We discuss a market-based alternative and show how it differs.]]></summary>

We show that firms that are likely to face costly external finance increase hedging after staggered state-level financial reform that reduces the costs of hedging. Post reform impacted firms have lower risk and fewer negative income shocks. Product market competition is also impacted. Firms that previously are more likely to face costly external finance, lower price, increase policy sales and increase their market share post reform. The results are consistent with hedging allowing firms that face potential costly financial distress to decrease risk and become more competitive.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, rising youth use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has prompted aggressive regulation by state and local governments. Between 2010 and 2019, ten states and two large counties adopted ENDS taxes. Applying a continuous treatment difference-in-differences approach to data from two large national datasets (Monitoring the Future and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System), this study explores the impact of ENDS taxes on youth tobacco use. We find that ENDS taxes reduce youth e-cigarette consumption, with estimated e-cigarette tax elasticities of -0.06 to -0.21. However, we estimate sizable positive cigarette cross-tax elasticities, suggesting economic substitution between cigarettes and e-cigarettes for youth. These substitution effects are particularly large for frequent cigarette smoking. We conclude that the unintended effects of ENDS taxation may more than fully offset any public health gains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adoption of health information and communication technologies (“HICT”) has surged over the past two decades. We survey the medical and economic literature on HICT adoption and its impact on clinical outcomes, productivity and labor.  We find that HICT improves clinical outcomes and lowers healthcare costs, but (i) the effects are modest so far, (ii) it takes time for these effects to materialize, and (iii) there is much variation in the impact. More evidence on the causal effects of HICT on productivity is needed to guide further adoption. There is little econometric work directly investigating the impact of HICT on labor, but what there is suggests no substantial negative effects on employment and earnings. Overall, while healthcare is “exceptional” in many ways, we are struck by the similarities to the wider findings on ICT and productivity stressing the importance of complementary factors (e.g. management and skills) in determining HICT impacts.]]></summary>

The multi-country model features global risk-aversion shocks and heterogeneity of investors both within and across countries. Within-country heterogeneity is needed to account for the drop in gross capital flows during a negative GFC shock (higher global risk-aversion). Cross-country heterogeneity is needed to account for the differential vulnerability of countries to a negative GFC shock. The key vulnerability is associated with leverage. In both the data and the theory, leveraged countries (net borrowers of safe assets) deleverage through negative net outflows of risky assets and positive net outflows of safe assets, experience a rise in the current account and a greater than average drop in risky asset prices. The opposite is the case for non-leveraged countries (net lenders of safe assets).]]></summary>

We analyse two measures of match at the university-subject level: undergraduate enrollment qualifications, and graduate earnings. We find for both that disadvantaged students match to lower quality degrees across the entire distribution of achievement, in a setting with uniform fees and a generous financial aid system. While there are negligible gender gaps in academic match, high-attaining women systematically undermatch in terms of expected earnings, driven by subject choice. These inequalities in match are largest among the most undermatched.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Investing in college carries high returns, but comes with considerable risk. Financial products like equity contracts can mitigate this risk, yet college is typically financed through non-dischargeable, government-backed student loans. This paper argues that adverse selection has unraveled private markets for college-financing contracts that mitigate risk. We use survey data on students' expected post-college outcomes to estimate their knowledge about future outcomes, and we translate these estimates into their implication for adverse selection of equity contracts and several state-contingent debt contracts. We find students hold significant private knowledge of their future earnings, academic persistence, employment, and loan repayment likelihood, beyond what is captured by observable characteristics. For example, our empirical results imply that a typical college-goer must expect to pay back $1.64 in present value for every $1 of equity financing to cover the financier's costs of covering those who would adversely select their contract. We estimate that college-goers are not willing to accept these terms so that private markets unravel. Nonetheless, our framework quantifies significant welfare gains from government subsidies that would open up these missing markets and partially insure college-going risks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although an extensive literature shows that startups are financially constrained and that constraints vary by geography, the source of these constraints is still relatively unknown. We explore intermediary financing constraints, a channel studied in the banking literature, but only indirectly addressed in the venture capital (VC) literature. Our empirical setting is the VC fundraising and startup financing environment around the passage of the Volcker Rule, which restricted banks’ ability to invest in venture capital funds as limited partners (LPs). The rule change disproportionately impacted regions of the U.S. historically lacking in VC financing. We find that a one standard deviation increase in VCs’ exposure to the loss of banks as LPs led to an 18% decline in fund size and about a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow-on fund. Startups were not completely cushioned from the additional constraints on their VCs: capital raised fell and pre-money valuations declined. Overall, VC financing constraints manifest as fewer, smaller funds that change investment strategy and experience increases in bargaining power. Last, we show that the rule change increased the likelihood startups move out of impacted states, thus exacerbating the geographic disparity in high-growth entrepreneurship.]]></summary>

지극히 평범한 보통사람 제이(J)가 2022년 한국에서 대통령이 된다는 상상 속의 가정으로부터 이 책은 출발한다. 그런데 여기저기서 ‘빵을 달라’는 외침을 마주하게 된 보통사람 제이(J)는 대한민국 국민들을 먹여 살리기 위해 빵칼을 들고 구체적으로 정부 현안들을 각 부처별로 들여다 보는 이야기이다.

 “델타 대통령의 빵칼”은 총3부로 구성되어 있는데, ‘빵칼을 들기 전에’, ‘빵칼을 들고’ 그리고 ‘빵을 달라’로 되어 있다. 모두가 본능적으로 느끼지만 말로 잘 표현하지 못하는 영역까지 이 책은 절제력을 가진 가운데 거침없이 들어간다. 더하기와 빼기의 정치력을 구체적으로 보여주는 대통령의 빵칼 암호는 델타(Delta)이다. 알파벳 D로 55개 정부 부처의 빵칼 코드를 읽어내는 흥미로움을 준다. 경제전략 정동희 작가의 10번째이자 마지막 책이다.

This column uses data from Japan and Korea to study the relationship between labour productivity growth, real wage growth, and labour’s terms of trade, defined as the ratio of the consumer price index to the GDP deflator. It shows that the main reason for the real wage-labour productivity growth gap is a large decline in labour’s terms of trade. Raising real wages in the future will require policies to support the business environment and develop high value-added sectors.]]></summary>

이벤트: 이 달의 문장 투표




“중국은 음모, 협작, 기망 등이 지저분하게 판치는 곳이다. 우리가 이를 반칙이라 생각하여 페어플레이를 고수한다면 우리는 그들에게 파트너도 적도 될 수 없다. 옹졸하고 비겁하며 영악한 강자와의 게임에서 우리는 내내 패배하고 있었다.” 저자가 ‘프롤로그’에서 밝힌 중국 비즈니스에 대한 진단이다.

이 책에서 소개하는 40가지의 사례들을 보면 중국 시장이 녹록은커녕 자칫하면 구렁텅이에 빠질 수 있다는 사실을 실감하게 된다. 물론 예전부터 이랬던 것은 아니다. 2006년까지만 해도 중국은 미국과 동일할 정도로 한국인들이 호감을 느끼는 국가였고, 우리에게 아주 친절하고 풍족하며 만만한 시장이었다. 중국인은 우리의 일상생활을 선망하고 대중문화에 열광하던 두껍고 너그러운 지갑의 소유자였다. 이런 상황은 사드발 한한령을 경계로 일변한다. 

이 책은 저자가 직간접적으로 겪은 중국 비즈니스의 다양한 사례로부터 필승 노하우의 핵심을 추려낸 것이다. 중국인과 중국 비즈니스의 민낯을 넘어 본질 그 구석구석까지 파헤쳐놓은 한중 비즈니스의 해부학 교재라고 지칭할 만하다. 

상대를 잘 파악하여 합리성에 기반한 냉철한 이성으로써 사업하는 것과, 무지한 낙관과 우리 사회에서나 통용될 법한 정의감 등의 잣대로 임하는 것은 천양의 차이로 귀결한다. 중국과의 사업에서 결핍해서는 안 될 태도와 필수 지식이 해학, 분노, 감동, 충격 등 흥미진진한 이야기를 통해 전수된다. 이길 수 있는 진짜배기 정보를 현장감 있는 에피소드를 통해 얻을 수 있는 것은 이 책만의 강점이다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: I'm tracking data for many local markets around the U.S.  I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.

From the DMAR: Monthly Indicators, August 2021


Total Residential Units Sold in August 2021 were 5,618, down 15.1% from 6,615 in August 2020.


Active Residential Listings in August 2021 were 3,582, down 11.7% from last month, and down 34.8% from 6,449 in August 2020.

 
New Residential Listings in August 2021 were 6,109, down 14.6% from last month, and down 10.1% from 6,794 in August 2020.


Inventory in Denver had been fairly steady over the last 6 or 7 years, but declined sharply in 2020.  This is still the lowest level of inventory for August on record.


From DMAR: DMAR Real Estate Market Trends Report | SEP. '21
Keeping in trend with traditional seasonality, the transition from July to August felt like a shift as vacations slowed down in preparation for the school year and fall. Buyers are more willing to be patient in order to find the right house for the “right” price. The report saw this reflected in the days in MLS, which increased from nine to 11 in August 2021. Likewise, the close-price-to-list-price ratio dipped ever so slightly month-over-month. In a dramatic data point, the month-end active inventory dropped 11.69 percent. Historically speaking, the change in inventory is relatively consistent from July to August. 
  
However, with both inventory and new listings decreasing, the short-lived “loose grip” on inventory has tightened once again. Months of inventory decreased from the previous month to 0.637. The report also indicated that if no one were to put a property on the market for 19 days, there would be nothing to sell in the entire Denver Metro area.
emphasis added
Active inventory in Denver is up 87% from the record low in March 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The headline unemployment rate of 5.2% significantly understates the current situation. 

Here is a table that shows the current number of unemployed and the unemployment rate (as of August 2021). 
  
Then I calculated the unemployment rate by including the number of people that have left the labor force since early 2020, and the expected growth in the labor force.

 Jul-215.4%8,702-3,1011,7008.1%
 Aug-215.2%8,384-2,9111,8007.9%
  
     
As the economy recovers, many of the people that left the labor force will probably return, and there will likely be more entrants into the labor force (although recent demographic data has been dismal).
  
It would be a mistake to just look at the headline unemployment rate to assess the current situation.]]></summary>

However, profound historical factors also played a role. In particular, areas where colonial rule was more ruthless in the 18th century – as measured by the expected returns to office, the tax burden, and the intensity of anti-colonial rebellions – exhibited higher support for Castillo in 2021. Interestingly, this support is not visible for other leftist and Marxist parties in the elections of 1980 and 1985.]]></summary>

Intermodal is navigating many of the same  challenges that have plagued global supply chains for  months, such as shutdowns at ports and manufacturing  centers in Asia; port congestion; labor and capacity  shortages at docks, warehouses, and drayage firms;  container and chassis shortages; natural and man-made  disasters (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and ships getting  stuck in canals).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 31st.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances Tick Down, With All Eyes on September Exits
The final week of August brought a 53,000 decline in the number of active forbearance plans, driven by a 23,000 reduction in plans among FHA/VA loans. Plan volumes also improved from the week prior among both GSE (-20,000) and portfolio/PLS (-10,000) loans.
  
According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, as of August 31, 1.71 million borrowers remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, including 1.8% of GSE, 5.6% of FHA/VA and 4.0% of portfolio held and privately securitized mortgages.
This puts plan volumes down nearly 9% (-168,000) from the same time last month as the market braces for the large wave of final plan expirations taking place in September. Of the 629,000 plans slated to be reviewed for extension/removal this month, nearly 400,000 are set to reach their final plan expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

Significant volume declines could be seen in coming weeks as those plans reach their final expirations and exiting borrowers return to making mortgage payments in October.

Leisure and hospitality was unchanged in August, probably due to the sharp increase in COVID cases.  In March and April of 2020, leisure and hospitality lost 8.2 million jobs, and are now down 1.7 million jobs since February 2020.  So leisure and hospitality has now added back almost 79% of the jobs lost in March and April 2020.

코로나19 이후 증시가 V자 반등을 하면서 주식을 처음 접한 개인투자자들이 많아졌다. 대한민국에 이토록 주식 열풍이 분 적은 없었다. 코인도 마찬가지이다. 현재 서점에서 팔리고 있는 투자 서적은 500여 권. 그런데 주가 조작이 횡행하는 주식시장에서 개인투자자가 실제 도움을 받을 만한 책은 없다. 저자는 아무도 알려주지 않는 작전 세력에 대해 제대로 알려주어, 개인투자자들이 정보의 비대칭을 극복하는 데 도움을 주고자 한다. 

이 책은 투자를 공부할 때 활용하는 PBR, PER과 같은 보조지표를 다루지 않는다. 그런 정보라면 이미 많은 책이 존재한다. 일반인이 합법과 불법 사이를 오가며 줄타기를 하는 작전 세력의 움직임을 알기란 참으로 어렵다. 개인은 자본력도 정보력도 뒤떨어지기 때문이다. 그러나 세력은 흔적을 남긴다. 

이 책은 그 흔적을 하나하나 보여준다. 잘 살피고 속지 말자. 세력의 매집 차트, 작전 세력의 의도, 실행, 결과까지 실증 데이터를 기반으로 전 과정을 파헤친다. 세력의 흔적을 찾아내는 7가지 요소 즉 매집 차트, N자 파동, 작업 세력, 전환사채와 유상증자, 작전 과정 그리고 코인 시장에서의 작전 등으로 정리해 누구나 쉽게 이해하고 적용해 볼 수 있다.

블록체인 기술에 기반한 신산업혁명을 이끌어가는 경제주체들을 하나하나 추적하며 블록체인 기술이 무엇인지, 어떻게 코인시장에 참여하고 이끌어가는지 파헤친다. 이론이 아니라 경제주체들의 행적을 좇아가며 신산업혁명의 실체에 접근한다.

코인시장은 한 나라 한 지역이 아닌 지구 행성을 하나의 시장으로 24시간 작동한다. 이 시장을 움직이는 주체는 누구일까? 비트코인이 법정화폐로 등장하고 미국 대통령 후원자는 암호화폐 친화적 기업과 투자은행이다. 애플과 아마존은 디파이 시장에 뛰어들었다. 독일 부유층과 기관투자자의 자금이 암호화폐 시장으로 흘러들어간다.

JP모건, 골드만삭스 등 세계적 투자은행은 암호화폐 투자상품 계획을 잇달아 내놓는다. 우리나라의 삼성, 한화, 그리고 테크기업 네이버, 카카오도 앞다투어 블록체인 기술에 투자하며 암호화폐를 발행한다. 이들이 코인시장을 만들어가는 주체들이다. 2020년 한 해 수익률은 이더리움과 비트코인을 따라올 자가 없었다. 이 주체들을 하나하나 만나볼 것이다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 8.4% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: Seasonality, Pandemic Continue To Weigh Down Weekly US Hotel Performance
U.S. hotel performance continued to decline from previous weeks, according to STR‘s latest data through August 28.
August 22-28, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 61.0% (-8.4%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $131.91 (+3.2%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $80.53 (-5.5%)
Performance continues to reflect seasonality as well as the pandemic situation. Additionally, while data for August 27-28 showed a preliminary demand shift in the Gulf region, the impact of Hurricane Ida is expected to be more significant in future weeks of data. 
...
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, occupancy is declining due to both seasonal factors and the "pandemic situation".
Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - especially with the sharp increase in COVID pandemic cases and hospitalizations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the Census Bureau reported that overall construction spending increased:
Construction spending during July 2021 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,568.8 billion, 0.3 percent above the revised June estimate of $1,563.4 billion. The July figure is 9.0  percent above the July 2020 estimate of $1,439.6 billion. 
emphasis added
Private and public spending increased:
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,231.0 billion, 0.3 percent above the revised June estimate of $1,227.8 billion. ...
In July, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $337.8 billion, 0.7 percent above the revised June estimate of $335.6 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 14% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 10% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been weak recently.
Public construction spending is 4% above the peak in March 2009, and 29% above the austerity low in February 2014, but weak recently.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 27.0%.  Non-residential spending is down 3.6% year-over-year.  Public spending is down 5.1% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service in most areas and did not decline sharply like many other sectors, but some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 29.8% YoY, multi-retail down 3.4% YoY, and office down 6.1% YoY.

This was at consensus expectations of a 0.3% increase in spending, and construction spending for the previous two months was revised up slightly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From ADP:
Private sector employment increased by 374,000 jobs from July to August according to the August ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly distributed to the public each  month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from ADP’s actual payroll data,  measures the change in total nonfarm private employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
“Our data, which represents all workers on a company’s payroll, has highlighted a downshift in the labor  market recovery. We have seen a decline in new hires, following significant job growth from the first half  of the year,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP. “Despite the slowdown, job gains are  approaching 4 million this year, yet still 7 million jobs short of pre-COVID-19 levels. Service providers  continue to lead growth, although the Delta variant creates uncertainty for this sector. Job gains across  company sizes grew in lockstep, with small businesses trailing a bit more than usual.”
  
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said, “The Delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have  dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job  growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.
emphasis added
  This was well below the consensus forecast of 638,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 728 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in August.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.]]></summary>

지난 160년 동안 지구상의 인구는 두 배에서 두 배, 거기서 또 거의 두 배로 늘어났다. 전 세계 1인당 GDP는 실질 가치로 따져도 10배 이상 증가했고, 말(馬)을 이동 수단으로 삼던 인류는 로켓을 타고 우주여행을 떠나기에 이르렀다. 속도를 높이는 세상에서 낙오하지 않기 위해 안간힘을 쓰는 것은 삶의 당연한 방식이었다.

그러나 이제 모든 것이 속도를 줄이기 시작했다. 여전히 앞으로 나아가고 있지만 나아가는 속도는 예전만 못하다. 단편적 시선으로는 알아차리기 힘들지만 여러 가지 거대한 지표가 변화의 감속 경향을 나타내고 있다. 인구도 경제도 기술도 사상의 발전도 서서히 속도를 줄이고 있다. 스마트폰이 대단한 혁신인양 떠들어대지만 전화, 컴퓨터, 인터넷이 처음 출현했을 때와 비교하면 소소할 뿐이다. 

책은 감속 중인 세계의 모습을 방대한 데이터와 입체적인 그래프를 통해 보여 준다. 흥미롭게도 감속, 즉 슬로다운은 많은 측면에서 긍정적으로 해석된다. 성장이 둔화됨에 따라 자본주의의 기세가 꺾이고 경제는 안정되며 부의 불평등이 완화되고 환경오염 문제도 줄어들 것이다. 지은이는 대가속 시대의 종말로 훨씬 인간적인 세상이 도래할 것이라고 예견한다. 속도를 줄인다는 것은 곧 빠르고 치열하게 살지 않아도 된다는 뜻이기 때문이다.

This column explores how the prevalence of immigration in the labour market affected different types of workers’ exposure to virus-related risks in 15 destination countries in Western Europe. It finds that not only were immigrant workers more vulnerable to the economic and health shocks of the pandemic; they also served as a protective shield for native workers. By undertaking higher-risk occupations, immigrants enabled native workers to move into work with fewer face-to-face interactions or jobs that could be carried out from the safety of home.]]></summary>

Freddie's serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are "three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure".

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.15%, unchanged from 0.15% in June, and down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family Serious Delinquency decreased to 1.94% in July, from 2.08% in June. The serious delinquency rate is down from 3.24% in July 2020.
These are mortgage loans that are "three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure".
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.

By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 4.82% are seriously delinquent (down from 5.04% in June).  For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 8.26% are seriously delinquent (down from 8.75%),  For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.57% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.69%). So Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once they are employed.]]></summary>

The first graph shows the office vacancy rate starting in 1980 (prior to 1999 the data is annual).

The office vacancy rate was elevated prior to the pandemic, and has moved up significant overly the last several quarters. And will likely increase further as leases expire.

Reis also reported that office effective rents declined in Q2; the fifth consecutive quarter with declining rents.
The second graph shows the regional and strip mall vacancy rate starting in 1980 (prior to 2000 the data is annual).
For Neighborhood and Community malls (strip malls), the vacancy rate was 10.5% in Q2, down from 10.6% in Q1, and up from 10.2% in Q2 2020.
For Regional malls, the vacancy rate was 11.5% in Q2, up from 11.4% in Q1, and up from 9.8% in Q2 2020.


Reis reported that mall effective rents stabilized in Q2, after declining for four consecutive quarters.

Mortgage rates drifted lower again today, with the average lender getting back down to the lowest levels since the first week of August.  In a general sense, today's friendly rate momentum represented follow-through momentum after Fed Chair Powell soothed the market on Friday morning.
...
Specifically, the labor market needs to show that it can weather the various storm cycles of the pandemic.  To that end, there are several upcoming reports that can offer some clarity with this Friday's jobs report being the most important.  In other words, even if the Fed doesn't have anything new to say this week, an exceptionally strong jobs report could easily push rates back up. [30 year fixed 2.91%]

Tuesday:
• At 9:00 AM ET, S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for June. The consensus is for a 18.6% year-over-year increase in the Comp 20 index for June.

영국의 마르크스주의 경제학자이자 런던 금융가(시티)에서 수십 년간 경제 전문가로 일한 지은이가 코로나19가 강타한 세계경제의 현 상태를 설명하고, 위기에 대응하려는 각종 대안과 정책을 마르크스주의 관점에서 날카롭게 분석하는 책이다.

이 책은 한국에서도 활발하게 전개되고 있는 논의와 관련 깊은 주제를 다룬다. 최신의 케인스주의뿐 아니라 현대화폐론처럼, 최근 좌파 사이에서 떠오른 대안(가령 일자리 보장제)의 근거가 되는 이론을 면밀하게 살펴본다. 독점이 경제 위기의 원인인지(즉, 독점 또는 재벌을 규제하면 되는지), 인공지능이 일자리를 빼앗을 것인지, 경기 침체 속에서도 왜 주가는 뛰는지, 정부의 경기 부양이 먹힐지 등 경제 핫이슈를 어렵지 않게 풀어낸다. 

또 토마 피케티나 데이비드 하비처럼 한국에서도 상당히 주목받는 좌파 경제학자의 기여와 함께 한계도 살펴보면서, 마르크스 《자본론》의 혁명적 함의가 여전히 오늘날에도 유의미함을 분명하게 제시하는 것은 무엇보다 두드러진 이 책의 장점이다.

지금의 위기가 어디서 비롯한 것이고 어떻게 끝날 수 있는지 고민하는 독자들이 여러 논의의 이론적 배경과 국제적 논쟁점을 더 넓은 시야로 파악하는 데 이 책이 도움이 될 것이다.

엮은이 말 
한국어판 머리말 

1부 코로나19와 세계경제
지금의 경제 위기가 단지 코로나19 때문일까? 
코로나19 팬데믹 후에 V형 회복이 될까? 
장기 불황으로 들어선 세계경제 

2부 독점, 인공지능, 주식, 경기 부양: 마르크스주의로 보기
독점: 불평등과 저성장의 원인일까? 
인공지능 로봇: 일자리를 빼앗을까? 
주식: 경제는 침체인데 왜 뛸까? 
경기 부양책: 경제를 살릴 수 있을까? 

3부 경제 위기 원인과 대안 논쟁
현대화폐론: 돈을 찍어 경제를 살릴 수 있을까? 
케인스주의: 긴축의 진정한 대안이 될 수 있을까? 
데이비드 하비: 이윤율 저하 경향의 법칙이 경제 위기를 설명 못 하나? 
토마 피케티: 자본 수익률은 자본주의 핵심 모순을 짚지 못한다

This column investigates the impact that a large immigration shock – in this case, the sudden influx of migrants to Norway following the 2004 enlargement of the EU – had on R&D investments. The results suggest that immigration shocks can have a negative impact on a receiving country’s R&D investments, with potentially long-term consequences for productivity growth.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: This is as of August 22nd.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Remains Unchanged at 3.25%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance remained  unchanged relative to the prior week at 3.25% as of August 22, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.6 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance remained the same relative to the prior  week at 1.66%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance also remained the same at 3.92%, while the  forbearance share for portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) increased 3 basis points to 7.18%. The percentage of loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers increased 2 basis points to 3.50%, and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers was unchanged at 3.35%.
“The share of loans in forbearance changed little once again this week, as both new requests and exits  remained at a slow pace,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “We  expect a sharp increase in forbearance exits over the next month as many borrowers reach the 18- month mark and see their forbearance plans end. For those borrowers who have exited in August, the  majority either enter deferral plans or obtain modifications.”

This graph shows the apartment vacancy rate starting in 1980. (Annual rate before 1999, quarterly starting in 1999). Note: Reis is just for large cities.
The vacancy rate has increased somewhat from the low in 2016.

There are other surveys that suggest the apartment market has tightened recently.   The NMHC reported that their market tightness index hit an all time high in July. There are other indicators that suggest the vacancy rate is moving lower.

Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of August 27th, inventory was at 431 thousand (7 day average), compared to 592 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 27.1%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 56%.


A week ago, inventory was at 422 thousand, and was down 27.3% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 40.7% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we'd normally expect, however inventory has increased (as a percentage) more than normal.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now above the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the NAR: Pending Home Sales Wane 1.8% In July
Pending home sales dipped modestly in July, noting two consecutive months of declines, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Only the West region registered a month-over-month gain in contract activity, while the other three major U.S. regions reported drops. All four regions saw transactions decrease year-over-year.
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, declined 1.8% to 110.7 in July. Year-over-year, signings fell 8.5%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI fell 6.6% to 92.0 in July, a 16.9% decrease from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index dropped 3.3% to 104.6 last month, down 8.5% from July 2020.
Pending home sales transactions in the South declined 0.9% to an index of 130.9 in July, down 6.7% from July 2020. The index in the West rose 1.9% in July to 99.8, but still down 5.7% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was below expectations of a 0.4% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in August and September.]]></summary>

2008년 글로벌 금융위기 이후 전 세계는 현재의 승자독식 자본주의가 만들어내는 극심한 빈부격차 문제에 주목했다. 이에 사회적경제가 새로운 대안으로 떠올랐다. 사회적경제는 시장경제의 효율성을 살리면서도 실업·빈곤 등 경제·사회 문제까지 극복할 수 있어 포용적 성장이 가능하기 때문이다. 

EU는 이미 2009년에 사회적경제 개념인식·법적조치 권고 등 48개 항목의 ‘사회적경제에 관한 결의문’을 채택했으며, 2015년 기준 EU에서의 사회적경제기업 고용 비중은 6.5%다. 우리나라 역시 1997년 외환위기 이후 부처별로 사회적경제 지원정책을 마련해 자활기업, 사회적기업, 마을기업, 협동조합, 소셜벤처 등 다양한 사회적경제기업이 활동 중이다. 또 2017년에는 정부에서 일자리위원회 관계부처 합동으로 ‘사회적경제 활성화 방안’을 발표했으며, 기획재정부의 장기전략국에 사회적경제과가 설치되었다. 이처럼 우리 사회에서 중요한 이슈로 떠오른 ‘사회적경제’에 대해 이 책은 우리에게 친근한 영화와 TV 드라마를 끌어와 보다 쉽게 설명하고자 한다.

진정한 ‘경알못(경제를 알지 못하는 사람)’들을 위해 탄생했던 도서 《모르면 호구 되는 경제상식》이 2021년 최신 개정판으로 출간되었다. 《모르면 호구 되는 경제상식》은 초판이 출간된 해에 ‘세종도서 교양부문 도서’로 선정되며 콘텐츠의 우수성을 입증, 제대로 된 경제상식 입문서를 찾는 독자들에게 지금까지 꾸준한 사랑을 받아왔다. 

이 책의 가장 큰 미덕은 금융·재테크부터 트렌드·시사상식까지 살아가는 동안 꼭 필요한 최소한의 경제상식들만 살뜰하게 한 권에 담아냈다는 것이다. 그동안 너무 어렵고 낯선 경제 용어와 장황한 서술 때문에 ‘경제’라고 하면 진저리를 쳤을 독자들이라도 이 책만큼은 끝까지 ‘완독’할 수 있을 것이다. 그만큼 우리 일상에서 쓰는 용어들로 경제 개념과 원리들을 차근차근 친절하게 풀어냈기 때문이다. 

머리 아픈 경제 공부는 싫지만, 몰라서 손해 보는 것은 더 싫고, ‘호구’ 소리 듣는 것은 더욱 끔찍이 싫은 독자라면 일단 이 책의 첫 장부터 넘겨보자. 마지막 페이지를 덮을 때쯤이면 나 자신을 지킬 수 있는 최소한의 무기를 갖출 수 있을 것이다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This study provides a structural analysis of detailed, alternating-offer bargaining data from eBay, deriving bounds on buyers and sellers private value distributions using a range of assumptions on behavior. These assumptions range from very weak (assuming only that acceptance and rejection decisions are rational) to less weak (e.g., assuming that bargaining offers are weakly increasing in players' private values). We estimate the bounds and show what they imply for consumer negotiation behavior in theory and practice. For the median product, bargaining ends in impasses in 43% of negotiations even when the buyer values the good more than the seller.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Value of Statistical Life (VSL) is arguably the most important number in benefit-cost analyses of environmental, health, and transportation policies.  However, agencies have used a wide range of VSL values.  One reason may be the embarrassment of riches when it comes to VSL studies.  While meta-analysis is a standard way to synthesize information across studies, we now have multiple competing meta-analyses and reviews.  Thus, to analysts, picking one such meta-analysis may feel as hard as picking a single "best study."  This paper responds by taking the meta-analysis another step, estimating a meta-analysis (or mixture distribution) of six meta-analyses.  The baseline model yields a central VSL of $7.0m, with a 90% confidence interval of $2.4m to $11.2m.  The provided code allows users to easily change subjective weights on the studies, add new studies, or change adjustments for income, inflation, and latency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The path of income inequality in post-reform China has been widely interpreted as “China’s Kuznets curve.” We show that the Kuznets growth model of structural transformation in a dual economy, alongside population urbanization, has little explanatory power for our new series of inequality measures back to 1981. Our simulations tracking the partial “Kuznets derivative” of inequality with respect to urban population share yield virtually no Kuznets curve. More plausible explanations for the inequality turning points relate to determinants of the gap between urban and rural mean incomes, including multiple agrarian policy reforms. Our findings warn against any presumption that the Kuznets process will assure that China has passed its time of rising inequality. More generally, our findings cast doubt on past arguments that economic growth through structural transformation in poor countries is necessarily inequality increasing, or that a turning point will eventually be reached after which that growth will be inequality decreasing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While formal mentorship programs are ubiquitous, less is known about who gains from receiving mentorship. In this paper, we report the outcome of a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) carried out in a US-based inbound sales call center where one branch of the experiment assigned a random subset of new hires to mentors (Broad-Mentoring), whereas a second branch (Selective-Mentoring) gave new hires the opportunity to opt into a mentoring relationship before assigning a random subset to mentors. In the Broad-Mentoring branch, mentored sales agents outperformed non-mentored agents by over 18% in the first six months on the job. Among agents who opt into the program in the Selective-Mentoring branch, those who received mentorship had negligible performance gains. The differences between the two branches indicates that formal mentorship program treatment effects are largest for workers who would otherwise opt out of these programs. Demographic and personality characteristics are relatively weak predictors of selection into the program, suggesting broad-based programs are likely more effective than alternative targeting rules.]]></summary>

The urban and industry bias of remote work potential shaped the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic impact. Many high-skill service workers started to work remotely, withdrawing spending from big-city consumer service industries dependent on their demand. As a result, low-skill service workers in big cities bore most of the recent pandemic’s economic impact. Our findings have broader implications for the distributional consequences of the U.S. economy’s transition to more remote work.]]></summary>

We structure our discussion around a simple model of a financial intermediary that concentrates its attention either on (i) the retail market and hence engages in a traditional maturity transformation business by accepting funds that can be used to invest in risky projects (loans), or (ii) the investment business, financing its operations on the “wholesale” market and making markets or investing in higher return riskier projects. Our discussion is centered around the analysis of market structure and competition in each of these markets, focusing in turn on (i) primary and secondary markets for government and corporate debt, (ii) interbank loans, (iii) markets for retail funding, and (iv) credit markets, including mortgages.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imperfections in risk and capital markets imply that individuals who lose jobs suffer from imperfect smoothing of consumption across states and times. Compared to the first best, there will be too little search. Optimal unemployment programs, which balance the marginal benefit of consumption smoothing vs. the marginal cost of the insurance externality, increase welfare and may even increase GDP. Our analytical results suggest that welfare is higher if the unemployment benefits program includes income-contingent unemployment loans (ICL), where the amount repaid depends on the individual’s future income. Such loans can be financed by a risk premium imposed on the unemployed who avail themselves of the loans, and partially substitute for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. Optimal unemployment benefits programs (UB) with ICL do a better job of smoothing consumption across states and time, and in particular total benefits when unemployed increase. We analyze how changes in key parameters, such as the degree of risk aversion and the nature of post-employment work, affect the design of the optimal UB program and the magnitude of the incremental benefits from including income-contingent loans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do central banks rebalance their currency shares? The answer matters because the dollar’s predominant role in large official reserve holdings means that widespread rebalancing requires central banks to buy (sell) a depreciating (appreciating) dollar, stabilising its value against other major currencies. We hypothesise that larger reserve holdings have led central banks to approach their investment more systematically and to make rebalancing in the face of exchange rate changes the norm. We illustrate the choice with two polar case studies: the US clearly does not rebalance its small FX reserves; Switzerland does rebalance its very large reserves, so that changes in exchange rates do not move its currency allocation. Our hypothesis finds partial support in global aggregated data. They reject both no rebalancing and full rebalancing and point to emerging market economies as the source of the aggregate result. We also test for rebalancing with panel data and find that our sample economies on average again behave in intermediate fashion, partially but not fully rebalancing. However, when observations are weighted by the size of reserves, the panel analysis finds full rebalancing. A variety of control variables and splits of the panel sample do not alter the thrust of these findings. Central banks rebalance their FX reserves extensively but not uniformly.]]></summary>

Little is known, however, about how participation in AGVCs changes the structure of participating economies. Using a constructed panel dataset from 155 countries for the period 1991-2015, I find that, in response to high AGVC participation, both GDP and employment shares in the agricultural and services sectors increase, and that both factors decrease in the manufacturing sector. Counter to conventional wisdom about structural transformation, I uncover evidence that modern agrarian economies are leapfrogging the manufacturing sector to directly develop their agriculture and services sectors through their participation in AGVCs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using data from 56 nations over 45 years, we find that nations that are more likely to elect left wing governments face higher (and more volatile) sovereign spreads. To explain these facts, we build a sovereign default model in which two policymakers (left and right) alternate in power. The probability of an incumbent staying in power is increasing in the share of government spending. We parametrize the left policymaker as having a higher marginal political gain from increasing government spending than the right does, a feature found in our data. Model economies in which the left is more frequently in power face worse borrowing terms due to higher default risk, a greater reluctance for fiscal austerity in bad times, and a higher share of government spending on average. These features imply large welfare losses for households.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I propose a financial channel of wage rigidity. In recessions, rather than propping up marginal (new hires’) costs of labor, rigid average wages squeeze cash flows, forcing firms to cut hiring due to financial constraints. Indeed, empirical cash flows and profits would turn acyclical if wages were only moderately more procyclical. I study this channel in a search and matching model with financial constraints and rigid wages among incumbent workers, while new hires’ wages are flexible. Individually, each feature generates no amplification. By contrast, their interaction can account for much of the empirical labor market fluctuations—breaking the neutrality of incumbents’ wages for hiring, and showing that financial amplification of business cycles requires wage rigidity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We analyze an environment where the uncertainty in the equity market return and its volatility are both stochastic, and may be potentially disconnected. We solve a representative investor's optimal asset allocation and derive the resulting conditional equity premium and risk-free rate in equilibrium. Our empirical analysis shows that the equity premium appears to be earned for facing uncertainty, especially high uncertainty that is disconnected from lower volatility, rather than for facing volatility as traditionally assumed. Incorporating the possibility of a disconnect between volatility and uncertainty significantly improves portfolio performance, over and above the performance obtained by conditioning on volatility only.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a textbook New Keynesian model extended to allow for uninsurable household income risk, any path of inflation and output implementable via interest rate policy is similarly implementable through uniform lump-sum transfers ("stimulus checks"). A dual-mandate policymaker can thus use checks to perfectly substitute for conventional monetary policy when rates are constrained by a lower bound. In a quantitative heterogeneous-agent (HANK) model, the stimulus check policy that implements a given monetary allocation is well-characterized by a small number of measurable sufficient statistics. In the household cross-section, the transfer policy is associated with lower consumption inequality than the equivalent rate cut.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Official statistics on deaths in India during the COVID pandemic are either incomplete or are reported with a delay.  To overcome this shortcoming, we estimate excess deaths in India using the household roster from a large panel data set, the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey, which reports attrition from death.  We address the problem that the exact timing of death is not reported in two ways, via a moving average and differencing monthly deaths.  We estimate roughly 4.5 million (95% CI: 2.8M to 6.2M) excess deaths over 16 months during the pandemic in India.  While we cannot demonstrate causality between COVID and excess deaths, the pattern of excess deaths is consistent with COVID-associated mortality.  Excess deaths peaked roughly during the two COVID waves in India; the age structure of excess deaths is right skewed relative to baseline, consistent with COVID infection fatality rates; and excess deaths are positively correlated with reported infections.  Finally, we find that the incidence of excess deaths was disproportionately among the highest tercile of income-earners and was negatively associated with district-level mobility.]]></summary>

This review article discusses one way in which these problems are intertwined: economic development affects the environment.

Start-ups purchase a disproportionate share of old physical capital previously owned by more mature firms.  The evidence is consistent with financial constraints driving differential demand for vintage capital.  The local supply of used capital influences start-up entry, job creation, investment choices, and growth, particularly when capital is immobile.  Conversely, incumbents accelerate capital replacement in the presence of more young firms.  The evidence suggests previously undocumented benefits to co-location between old and young firms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We document the extent, nature, and consequences of survey errors in cash welfare and SNAP receipt in three major U.S. household surveys. We find high rates of misreporting, particularly failure to report receipt. The surveys inaccurately capture patterns of multiple program participation, even though there is little evidence of program confusion. Error rates are higher among imputed observations, which account for a large share of false positive errors. Many household characteristics have significant effects on both false positives and false negative errors. Error rates sharply differ by race, ethnicity, income and other household characteristics.  The errors greatly affect models of program receipt and estimated effects of income and race are noticeably biased. We examine error due to item non-response and imputation, as well as whether imputation improves estimates. Item non-respondents have higher receipt rates than the population conditional on covariates. The assumptions for consistent estimates in multivariate models fail both when excluding item non-respondents and when using the imputed values.  In binary choice models of program receipt, linked data estimates favor excluding item non-respondents rather than using imputed values. Biases are well predicted by the error patterns we document, helping researchers make informed decisions on whether to use imputed values.]]></summary>

This paper explores the impact of demographic characteristics of innovators and potential adopters on the adoption of important new scientific ideas through networks. Using rich, population-level data on the biomedical researchers and their networks, natural language processing, and a novel two-way fixed effects strategy, we find that new ideas introduced by female scientists are under-utilized, which can be explain by two factors. First, female innovators are not as well-connected in networks; second, even at a short network distances, researchers (especially men) are less likely to adopt women’s ideas. Ideas from underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities are also less widely used.]]></summary>

Vaccine production is increasing, but supply still constrains vaccinations worldwide. Using lower doses of vaccines could dramatically accelerate vaccination. Available evidence on efficacy is not dispositive but suggests half- or even quarter-doses of some vaccines could be almost as effective as currently-used doses. Even if fractional doses are less effective than standard doses, an epidemiological model suggests they could significantly reduce total infections and deaths. The social value of testing dwarfs the costs. However, firms do not internalize the full social value, a market failure that could be addressed with public funding. Governments could support either experimental or observational evaluations of fractional dosing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The food supply chain has experienced major disruptions from both demand and supply sides during the Covid-19 pandemic. While some consequences such as food waste are directly caused by the disruption due to supply chain inefficiency, others are indirectly caused by a change in consumer’s preferences. As a result, evaluating food supply chain resilience is a difficult task. With an attempt to understand impacts of demand on the food supply chain, we developed an agent-based model based on the case of Idaho’s potato supply chain. Results showed that not only the magnitude but also the timing of the demand shock will have different impacts on various stakeholders of the supply chain. Our contribution to the literature is two-fold. First, the model helps explain why food waste and shortages may occur with dramatic shifts in consumer demand. Second, this paper provides a new angle on evaluating the various mitigation strategies and policy responses to disruptions beyond Covid-19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Labour productivity is more procyclical in OECD countries with lower employment volatility. To capture this new stylised fact, this column proposes a business cycle model with employment adjustment costs, variable hours, and labour effort. In the model with variable effort, it shows that greater labour market frictions are associated with procyclical labour productivity as well as stable employment. In contrast, the constant-effort model fails to replicate the observed cross-country pattern in the data. Labour market deregulation has a greater effect on labour productivity cyclicality and employment volatility when effort can vary.]]></summary>

From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&P 500 are up 43 and DOW futures are up 260 (fair value).
Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI futures at $69.33 per barrel and Brent at $73.42 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $43, and Brent was at $45 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 60% year-over-year.

Below is a graph of expenditures on energy goods and services as a percent of total personal consumption expenditures through July 2021.
This is one of the measures that Professor Hamilton at Econbrowser looks at to evaluate any drag on GDP from energy prices.

The huge spikes in energy prices during the oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 are obvious.  As is the increase in energy prices during the 2001 through 2008 period. 
In general, energy expenditures as a percent of PCE have been trending down for years.
At the beginning of the pandemic, energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE, fell to a record low of 3.3% in May 2020.


In July 2021,  energy expenditures as a percentage of PCE had rebounded and were at 4.0% of PCE.  This is slightly above the pre-pandemic level in early 2020.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BEA released the Personal Income and Outlays, July 2021 report yesterday.   The report showed that government transfer payments were still almost $1.0 trillion (on SAAR basis) above the February 2020 level (pre-pandemic)  Note: Seasonal adjustment doesn't make sense with one time payments, but that is how the data is presented.  

This table shows the amount of unemployment insurance and "Other" transfer payments since January 2020 (pre-crisis level).  The increase in "Other" was mostly due to parts of the relief acts including direct payments.

Note: Not in the table below, but Social Security and Medicare payments haven't increased significantly from the pre-recession levels.  Social Security increased from $1,065 billion SAAR in Jan 2020 to $1,113 billion SAAR in July 2021.  Medicare increased from $807 billion to $821 billion.  Medicaid increased significantly from $603 billion to $760 billion.


But most of the increase in transfer payments - compared to the levels prior to the crisis - is from unemployment insurance and "other" (includes direct payments).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 24th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Familiar Midmonth Uptick in Forbearances
Continuing the same mid-month trend we also noted last week, the number of active forbearance plans edged slightly higher once again.
  
According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, there are now 1.76 million borrowers who remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans as of August 24, including 1.9% of GSE, 5.8% of FHA/VA and 4.1% of portfolio held and privately securitized mortgages.
The overall number of active forbearances rose by 12,000 since last Tuesday, driven primarily by a 10,000 increase in plans among portfolio/PLS loans. FHA/VA volumes also rose – though a more modest 3,000 – with GSE plans seeing the week’s only decline (-1,000).
Click on graph for larger image.
  
This puts plan volumes down 132,000 from the same time last month for a 7% decline. More than 150,000 plans are slated for review for extension or removal through the final week of August, so there is still some opportunity for modest improvement yet this month.
That number ramps up to nearly 670,000 for September, though, with 415,000 of those plans set to reach their final expiration next month based on current allowable forbearance term lengths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 9.1% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Performance Continues Decline in Mid-August
Reflecting seasonal demand patterns and concerns around the pandemic, U.S. hotel performance continued to decline from previous weeks, according to STR‘s latest data through August 21.
August 15-21, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 63.7% (-9.1%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $135.77 (+5.1%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $86.43 (-4.5%)
While none of the Top 25 Markets recorded an occupancy increase over 2019, Detroit came closest to its 2019 comparable (-0.7% to 69.3%).
...
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid - but, according to STR, occupancy is declining due to both seasonal factors and "concerns around the pandemic".
Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - especially with the sharp increase in COVID pandemic cases and hospitalizations.]]></summary>

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the second quarter of 2021, according to the "second" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the first quarter, real GDP increased 6.3 percent.
The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the "advance" estimate issued last month. In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 6.5 percent. The update reflects upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and exports that were partly offset by downward revisions to private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, were revised down

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the Philly Fed: 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has released the coincident indexes for the 50 states for July 2021. Over the past  three months, the indexes increased in 48 states, decreased in one state, and remained stable in one, for a three-month  diffusion index of 94. Additionally, in the past month, the indexes increased in 46 states, decreased in one state, and remained stable in three, for a one-month diffusion index of 90. For comparison purposes, the Philadelphia Fed has also  developed a similar coincident index for the entire United States. The Philadelphia Fed’s U.S. index increased 1.9 percent  over the past three months and 0.8 percent in July.
emphasis added
Note: These are coincident indexes constructed from state employment data.  An explanation from the Philly Fed: 
The coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state’s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state’s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.

Here is a map of the three month change in the Philly Fed state coincident indicators.  This map was all red during the worst of the Pandemic and also at the worst of the Great Recession.
The map is almost all positive on a three month basis.

And here is a graph is of the number of states with one month increasing activity according to the Philly Fed. 

This graph includes states with minor increases (the Philly Fed lists as unchanged).
In July, 48 states had increasing activity including minor increases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some interesting information from the REALTORS® Confidence Index Survey July 2021
Several metrics indicate that demand is cooling in a moderately strong market. With limited supply in the  market, homes typically sold within 17 days (22 days one year ago). The REALTORS® Buyer Traffic Index decreased further from 71 in June to 64 in July (moderately strong conditions) while the REALTORS® Seller  Traffic Index remains below 50 which is “weak” traffic compared to the level one year ago. On average, a home  sold had more than 4 offers, for which remains unchanged from last month’s survey. REALTORS® expect home  prices in the next three months to increase nearly 2% from one year ago compared to 4% outlook in last  month’s survey. Respondents expect sales in the next three months to decrease 1% from last year’s sales level  compared to the 1% outlook in last month’s survey.  
emphasis added

This map, from the July NAR report, shows buyer traffic is mostly "moderately strong" just about everywhere.
This is less demand than last month, and significantly less than a few months ago. 
As the NAR noted: "demand is cooling in a moderately strong market".
 The second map is from the April report.
In April, buyer traffic was very strong just about everywhere.
There has also been a shift in seller traffic, with more traffic in many states (compare map from April on page 3 to the map from July also on page 3).]]></summary>

지금 우리는 이전과는 완전히 다른 세계를 맞이하고 있다. 그리고 이 세계는 우리가 지금까지 진리와 상식으로 믿어왔던 투자 공식을 파괴하며 혼돈을 키우고 있다. 과학과 기술의 발전으로 시간의 가치가 감소하며, 다양한 요소들의 합으로 불확실성과 우연이 일상화가 되는 사회를 복잡계라고 한다. 앞으로 미래에는 하나의 현상에 하나의 원인만 존재하는 것이 아니라 여러 가지 요소들이 복합적으로 작용하여 우리는 결과를 예측하기 어려운 사회를 살아가게 될 것이다. 

타이거자산운용 오종태 투자전략 이사는 2008년 글로벌 경제위기 이후 기존의 방식으로는 설명되지 않는 경제와 투자 세계를 바라보며 복잡계에 대해 연구했고, 이를 투자에 접목시켜 큰 수익을 창출했다. 업계에서는 투자의 숨은 고수로 불렸지만 방송 출연은 전무했다. 

하지만 2021년 4월 「삼프로TV」에서 복잡계 투자를 소개하며 단 1회 방송만으로 ‘레전드 강의’라는 폭발적 반응을 일으켰고, 방송에서는 말하지 못했던 복잡계 이론을 한 권의 책에 압축해 담았다. 지금의 복잡계의 흐름을 과학, 정치, 경제의 사건으로 짚어보며, 복잡계가 바꾸고 있는 투자의 미래, 그리고 복잡계에서 살아남기 위해 필요한 투자 지침까지 이 책을 통해 지금까지 알고 있던 투자의 공식을 바꾸고 새로운 투자 세계에서 살아남을 수 있는 가이드라인을 얻을 수 있을 것이다.

저자의 말 점점 더 복잡해지는 삶과 투자에 대해 이야기해봅시다

1부 영원히 변화하는 세계

수용하기 벅찬 변화의 가속
지식이 지식의 근거가 되는 세상의 종말
명료함의 독에 빠지지 말자
변화하지 않는 삶은 이제 존재하지 않는다
삶의 방식과 사고 구조의 대전환이 필요하다
변화의 폭을 넓히고 싶다면?
세상을 복잡계로 바라보는 인디언처럼

단순계와 복잡계
탐구가 중요한 단순계, 변화가 중요한 복잡계
절대 진리가 발전시킨 서양의 단순계
복잡계 세상을 이해하는 데 동양이 서양보다 유리하다?
복잡계를 이해하려는 서양의 시도들

우연을 다루다
합리화의 수단으로 사용된 우연
우연을 예측하는 것은 가능할까?
앞으로의 우연에 대처할 우리의 자세

복잡계에 단순계를 적용하는 지금의 현실
외부가 아닌 내부에 집중하라
복잡계 선두에 설 저력이 충분한 대한민국
단순계에서 복잡계 사고 구조로 바꾸려면?
복잡계의 이해 방식을 받아들이는 삶

멀티 & 메타, 멀티 vs. 메타
공존하면서도 대치하는 멀티와 메타
포함되면서도 분리되는 멀티, 경계가 없는 메타
스스로 모든 것을 만드는 메타버스의 탄생
과학 기술이 만드는 메타 세계
각개전투는 그만, 협동을 통해 시너지를 낸다
경제학적 관점보다 생태학적 관점이 주목받는 시대가 온다

투자 vs. 투기
함께하는 Nom, 활용하는 Nom, 사기 치는 Nom
투자는 제로섬이 아닌 윈-윈 게임이다
하나만 선택할 이유는 없다

2부 복잡계의 탄생과 지금, 복잡계를 이해하는 법

이해의 구조를 이해하는 법
데이터, 정보, 지식, 지혜, 직관의 이해 과정
틀리지도 못하는 삶에서 벗어나자
지혜로운 사람은 ‘내가 모른다’는 사실을 늘 인지한다
생각은 우리의 몸도 바꾼다
인간은 불확실한 정보를 가지고도 결론을 내릴 수 있다
복잡계 3의 법칙

단순계의 경제 구조와 투자 방식
2에서 3, 다시 2로 돌아온 계층 구조
구조에 대한 해석은 시대에 따라 달라진다
단순계의 기초가 되는 사이클 이론
사이클의 발생과 대응에 집중했던 단순계 경제 구조
단순계로 판단...

NFT는 ‘Non-Fungible Token(대체불가 토큰)’의 약자로, 미술, 음악, 게임, 부동산 등 유·무형의 다양한 자산들의 소유권과 거래내역을 블록체인에 저장한 디지털 파일이다. 1:1 맞교환이 가능한 기존 화폐나 암호화폐 등과 달리 NFT는 각각의 자산이 고윳값을 지녀 ‘상호 대체가 불가’하고 원본임을 증명할 수 있으며 희소성이 있다. 일반인도 쉽게 거래할 수 있고, 현금화도 가능하다. ‘자산’의 가치를 인정받으며 투자 수단으로도 떠오르는 이유다. 

게다가 종류도 활용도 무궁무진하다. 디지털 세상에만 존재하는 자산(디지털 미술 작품, 디지털 음반, 모바일 이벤트 티켓 등)과 실물로 존재하는 자산(갤러리에 전시된 작품, 금, 빌딩 등)은 물론, 개념적 자산(투표권, 관심이나 주목, 평판 등) 모두 블록체인상에 NFT로 제작하고 거래할 수 있다. 최근에는 현실 세상을 너머 가상 세계인 메타버스에서 NFT가 경제 시스템으로 작동하면서 더욱 주목받고 있다.

This column presents key trends in US political polarisation and discusses their implications. It shows that polarisation (1) has been increasing since the 1980s, (2) has grown at similar rates across different age groups, and (3) has increased more in the US relative to many other developed countries. Potential determinants for these trends in US political polarisation include racial divisions, elite polarisation, and cable TV news consumption.]]></summary>

핵심만 쏙쏙 담은 생활밀착형 인공지능 입문서. 인공지능을 실제 사례를 중심으로 그 내용을 풀어가며 해설하여, 이해도와 응용력을 높임과 동시에 인공신경망과 딥러닝의 큰 틀과 원리를 이해할 수 있도록 구성하였다. 인공지능이 일상에서 어떻게 활용될 수 있는지 생활 속 예제들을 통해 살아있는 인공지능을 느낄 수 있도록 하였다.  

기존의 인공지능 또는 인공지능 수학 도서는 단원별 목차에 맞춘 개념 해설과 풀이가 대부분이었다. 이 경우 전체적 이해도와 응용력이 떨어질 수밖에 없다. 이 책은 <한눈에 보이는 인공지능 학습맵>을 통해 전체적인 흐름을 파악할 수 있게 도와주고, 실생활을 인공지능 모델로 바꾸고, 직접 학습해 보는 실습 예제를 반복 학습을 통해 익힐 수 있도록 풀이 과정을 모듈화하였다.

파이썬의 기초적인 지식만 있으면 누구든 이 책을 통해 본격적인 인공지능 학습이 가능하다. 특히 인공신경망 학습의 핵심인 경사하강법과 오차역전파법에 대해서는 어떤 교재보다도 알기 쉽게 설명하였다. 또한 이 책은 많은 도서에 포함된 실습용 예제 코드를 실행하면서 어려움을 겪었던 학습자에게 실패하지 않는 비법을 전수하고자 했다. 각 프로그램의 버전을 알려주는 대로 설치하기만 하면 모든 예제 코드가 오류 없이 실행되는 즐거움을 맛볼 수 있다…]]></summary>

From the Census Bureau: "The median sales price of new houses sold in July 2021 was $390,500.  The average sales price was $446,000."
The following graph shows the median and average new home prices.
 Click on graph for larger image.
During the housing bust, the builders had to build smaller and less expensive homes to compete with all the distressed sales.  When housing started to recovery - with limited finished lots in recovering areas - builders moved to higher price points to maximize profits.

Then the average and median house prices mostly moved sideways since 2017 due to home builders offering more lower priced homes.  Prices picked up during the pandemic, and really picked up recently.
The average price in July 2021 was a record $446,00, up 18% year-over-year.  The median price was a record $390,500, up 18% year-over-year.  
The second graph shows the percent of new homes sold by price.
Very few new homes sold were under $200K in July 2021 (about 1.6% of all homes).  This is down from 56% in 2002.  In general, the under $200K bracket is going away.    
The $400K and greater than $500K+ brackets increased significantly over the last decade.  


Half of new homes (about 50% in July) in the U.S., are in the $200K to $400K range.  The fastest growing price segment over the last 2 years has been the $400K to $500K range.]]></summary>

This was somewhat above consensus expectations for July, but still down 27.2% year-over-year - since sales increased sharply following the early months of the pandemic.  The new home sales rate is now slightly below the pre-pandemic level of around 740 thousand (the three months previous to pandemic). 


Earlier: New Home Sales Increase to 708,000 Annual Rate in July.

This graph shows new home sales for 2020 and 2021 by month (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
The year-over-year comparisons were easy in the first half of 2021 - especially in March and April.
However, sales will likely be down year-over-year for the remainder of 2021 - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
And on inventory: note that completed inventory (3rd graph in previous post) is near record lows, but inventory under construction is closer to normal.
This graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction.
  
The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 36 thousand in July, just above the record low of 33 thousand in March, April and May 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (just above the record low).

The inventory of new homes under construction is at 3.8 months - slightly above the normal level.


However, a record 105 thousand homes have not been started - about 1.8 months of supply - about double the normal level.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digitalization of Money is a crossroad in monetary history. Advances in technology has led to the development of new forms of money: virtual (crypto) currencies like bitcoin; stable coins like libra/diem; and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) like the Bahamian sand dollar. These innovations in money and finance have resonance to earlier shifts in monetary history: 1) The shift in the eighteenth and nineteenth century from commodity money (gold and silver coins) to convertible fiduciary money and inconvertible fiat money; 2) the shift in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from central bank notes to a central bank monopoly; 3) Then evolution since the seventeenth century of central banks and the tools of monetary policy. 

This paper analyzes the arguments for a CBDC through the lens of monetary history. The bottom line is that the history of transformations in monetary systems suggests that technical change in money is inevitably driven by the financial incentives of a market economy. Government has always had a key role in the provision of outside money, which is a public good. Government has also regulated inside money provided by the private sector. This held for fiduciary money and will likely hold for digital money. CBDC could make monetary policy more efficient, and it could transform the international monetary and payments systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The regulated insurance exchanges set up in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were designed to deliver affordable, efficient health coverage through private insurers. It is crucial to study the complex industrial organization (IO) of these exchanges in order to assess their impacts to date, during the first decade of the ACA, and in order to project their impacts going forward. We revisit the inherent market failures in health care markets that necessitate key ACA exchange regulations and investigate whether they have succeeded in their goals of expanding coverage, creating robust marketplaces, providing product variety, and generating innovation in health care delivery. We discuss empirical IO research to date and also highlight shortcomings in the existing research that can be addressed moving forward. We conclude with a discussion of IO research-based policy lessons for the ACA exchanges and, more generally, for managed competition of private insurance in health care.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unemployment is notoriously difficult to predict.  In previous studies, once country fixed effects are added to panel estimates, few variables predict changes in unemployment rates.  Using panel data for 29 European countries over 439 months between 1985 and 2021 in an unbalanced country*month panel of just over 10000 observations, we predict changes in the unemployment rate 12 months in advance based on individuals’ fears of unemployment, their perceptions of the economic situation and their own household financial situation.  Fear of unemployment predicts subsequent changes in unemployment 12 months later in the presence of country fixed effects and lagged unemployment.  Individuals’ perceptions of the economic situation in the country and their own household finances also predict unemployment 12 months later. Business sentiment (industry fear of unemployment) is also predictive of unemployment 12 months later.  The findings underscore the importance of the “economics of walking about”. The implication is that these social survey data are informative in predicting economic downturns and should be used more extensively in forecasting.  We also generate a 29 country-level annual panel on life satisfaction from 1985-2020 from the World Database of Happiness and show that the consumer level fear of unemployment variable lowers well-being over and above the negative impact of the unemployment rate itself.  Qualitative survey metrics were able to predict the Great Recession and the economic slowdown in Europe just prior to the COVID19 pandemic.]]></summary>

In all cases, the timing and nature of the effects are consistent with a causal interpretation.

We present a model of lending markets with imperfect competition, adverse selection and costly lender screening. In more competitive markets, lenders have lower market shares, and thus lower incentives to monitor borrowers. Thus, when markets are competitive, all lenders face a riskier pool of borrowers, which can lead interest rates to be higher, and consumer welfare to be lower. We provide evidence for the model’s predictions in the auto loan market using administrative credit panel data.]]></summary>

Research relating to both collusion and mergers has made significant advances in the last twenty years. With respect to collusion, this includes important theoretical and empirical work on the sustainability, structure, and impact of collusive schemes. With respect to mergers, this includes important work on the impact of enforcement institutions, both theoretical and empirical work on unilateral effects, and theoretical work on the selection of which mergers get proposed to antitrust agencies and optimal policy in the face of that selection. A feature of recent research is the increasing complementarity between empirical work (ranging from observational studies to model-based measurement) and theoretical work in advancing our understanding of collusive and merger-related phenomena.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper analyzes the impact of exchange rate risk on global food supply chains. Although the theoretical literature suggests ambivalence regarding the sign and magnitude of this effect, most empirical studies indicate a negative association between exchange rate volatility and international trade flows. I contribute to the ongoing debate by investigating the relationship at the product-level using a sectoral gravity model and relying on detailed retrospective trade and exchange rate data for a balanced panel of 159 countries for 2001 to 2017. I study the relationship for 781 agricultural and food products and estimate the trade effects of short-run and long-run exchange rate volatility. My findings indicate significant heterogeneity in the trade effects of exchange rate risk. While the mean trade effects are positive for short-run and long-run volatility, these effects vary substantially according to product and industry characteristics. I find a positive association between exchange rate volatility and the trade effects for upstreamness and a negative association for downstreamness of the traded products. I show that the significant and adverse trade effects in earlier studies result from model misspecification and measurement errors. This research enhances the understanding of the implications of exchange rate volatility which is a primary source of international risk exposure for global food supply chains.]]></summary>

This review presents a meta-analysis of the recent empirical literature that examines perceptions about others in the field. We document a number of stylized facts. Misperceptions about others are widespread, asymmetric, much larger when about out-group members, and positively associated with one’s own attitudes. Experimental treatments to re-calibrate misperceptions generally work as intended; they sometimes lead to meaningful changes in behaviors, though this often occurs only immediately after the treatments. We discuss different conceptual frameworks that could explain the origin, persistence, and rigidity of misperceptions about others. We point to several directions for future research.]]></summary>

Such contracting difficulties have long been argued to be an important reason for acquisitions. To evaluate the extent to which this motivation leads to mergers, we perform a textual analysis of the patents filed by the same lead inventors of the target firms before and after the mergers. We find that patents of inventors from target firms become 28.9% to 46.8% more specific to those of acquirers’ inventors following completed mergers, benchmarked against patents filed by targets and a group of counterfactual acquirers. This pattern is stronger for vertical mergers that are likely to require specialized investments. There is no change in the specificity of patents for mergers that are announced but not consummated. Overall, we provide empirical evidence that contracting issues in motivating specialized investment can be a motive for acquisitions.]]></summary>

By abstaining on Friday, the average lender was forced to adjust today's rates slightly higher to account for the bond market weakness.  In other words, this morning's rates were higher than Friday morning's.
As the day progressed, mortgage bonds improved enough for a friendly mid-day reprice.  A majority of lenders pulled the trigger, thus helping rates close the gap with Friday's rates.  Simply put, rates started the day moderately higher versus Friday morning, but are now only marginally higher (assuming the lender in question offered a mid-day price improvement).  ...

한국의 대표적 빅테크 기업 카카오와 네이버의 블록체인 경쟁이 점점 치열해지고 있다. 수십억 원을 글로벌 블록체인에 기업에 투자하는 것은 물론 그라운드X, 라인플러스 등 블록체인 자회사의 규모도 키우는 중이다. 카카오 그라운드X가 승기를 잡은 한국은행 디지털 원화 사업(CBDC)도 그동안 카카오의 블록체인 투자가 결실을 맺은 순간이었다. 이렇듯 블록체인은 단순히 가상화폐 기반 기술이 아니라 미래 산업을 이끄는 기업들은 반드시 갖춰야 하는 필수 기술이 된 것이다.

IT 전문 포럼 커넥팅랩이 새롭게 출간한 《블록체인 트렌드 2022-2023》은 금융, 유통, IoT, 콘텐츠 분야에서 급속도로 발전한 블록체인 산업 현황을 상세하게 담아냈다. 특히 금융에서는 코로나19 이후 재편된 금융 플랫폼의 변화를 다뤘다. 비대면 거래가 일상화되자 토스, 렌딧 등 핀테크 기업들이 한 단계 더 성장했고 카카오, 네이버 등 빅테크 기업들이 블록체인 기술로 무장해 호시탐탐 기존 은행의 자리를 노리고 있다.

또한 콘텐츠 분야에서의 변화도 눈에 띈다. 네이버 제페토, 로블록스 등 메타버스 플랫폼이 인기를 끌면서 블록체인이 현실세계와 가상세계를 잇는 기술적 가교역할을 하고 있다. 유통, IoT 분야에서도 블록체인의 발전으로 중개기관의 역할이 축소되고 거래 속도…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: This is as of August 15th.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Slightly Decreases to 3.25%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 1 basis point from 3.26% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 3.25% as of August 15, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.6 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 1.66%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 3.92%, while the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) increased 10 basis points to 7.15%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers increased 2 basis points to 3.48%,  and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased 1 basis point to 3.35%.
“The share of loans in forbearance was little changed, as both new requests and exits were at a slower  pace compared to the prior week. In fact, exits were at their slowest pace in over a year,” said Mike  Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “There were more new forbearance  requests and re-entries for portfolio and PLS loans, leading to a 10-basis-point increase in their share.  Portfolio and PLS loans now account for almost 50% of all depository servicer loans in forbearance and  almost 40% of IMB servicer loans in forbearance, which highlights the importance of this investor  category.”

Two key points:
1) Existing home sales are somewhat above pre-pandemic levels rate of around 5.5 million SAAR (average six months prior to pandemic).  Seasonally adjusted (SA) sales for July 2021 were also the highest since 2006 - about 2% above July 2020. 

Some of the increase in sales over the previous year was probably related to  record low mortgage rates, strong second home buying, a strong stock market and favorable demographics.


Also, the delay in the 2020 buying season pushed the seasonally adjusted number to very high levels over the winter.   This means there are going to be some difficult comparisons in the second half of 2021!

Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of August 20th, inventory was at 432 thousand (7 day average), compared to 594 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 27.3%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55%.


A week ago, inventory was at 422 thousand, and was down 29.8% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 40.8% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we'd normally expect, however inventory has increased (as a percentage) more than normal.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - back to the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.]]></summary>

The dashed line is the percent of 2019 for the seven day average.
The 7-day average is down 23.3% from the same day in 2019 (76.7% of 2019).  (Dashed line)
There was a slow increase from the bottom starting in May 2020 - and then TSA data picked up in 2021 - but the dashed line was moving sideways, and has moved down recently.

This column uses data from the Italian electricity market to challenge this view in the context of the electricity sector, showing that carbon pricing schemes may not work efficiently when the major firms in the market are government controlled. As the vast majority of large electricity generators in the world are government-controlled and the electricity sector accounts for more than 40% of global carbon emissions from fuel combustion, the findings have important policy implications. Properly implemented command and control approaches might be more efficient, especially since reliable estimates of the production functions of electric generators are readily available.]]></summary>

Monday:

• At 10:00 AM, Existing Home Sales for July from the National Association of Realtors (NAR).  The consensus is for 5.81 million SAAR, down slightly from 5.86 million last month.
From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&P 500 are up 4 and DOW futures are up 30 (fair value).
Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $62.38 per barrel and Brent at $65.49 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $42, and Brent was at $44 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 50% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Rates Stuck in The Middle
Rates are on hold until the next chapter is written in the complex saga of covid versus the market. This isn't to say rates perfectly flat--simply that the prevailing momentum has been sideways for the past few weeks.
Since mortgage rates only change once or twice a day, we can use 10yr Treasury yields to see finer detail.  This entire week took place in the fairly narrow range of 1.29 to 1.21, and it ended with yields precisely in the middle at 1.25%.
...
What does all this mean in plain English?  Rates are low--much lower than most anyone expected at this point in the year.  The key reason is "delta" and Fed's patient approach to changing rate-friendly policies.  The lingering concerns about the nature of the post-covid economy also make the list. [30 year fixed 2.93%]

3Q GDP growth is currently coming in at 4.5%, leaving annual growth to slip to 5.9% this year. We think the Delta variant is a large reason for the soft patch as can be seen by the pullback in spending on leisure services.  But we also have to consider the possibility of more permanent supply-side constraints and greater precautionary savings.  [August 20 estimate]

From Goldman Sachs: 
We have lowered our Q3 GDP forecast to +5.5%, reflecting hits to both consumer spending and production. Spending on dining, travel, and some other services is likely to decline in August, though we expect the drop to be modest and brief. Production is still suffering from supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto industry, and this is likely to mean less inventory rebuild in Q3. [August 18 estimate]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 17th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances Edge Slightly Higher
After dropping by more than 150,000 over the past two weeks, we once again saw active forbearance plans edge up slightly in what has become a well-established mid-month trend. 
  
The week’s 11,000 overall increase was driven entirely by a 12,000 rise in plans among Portfolio/PLS loans and offset by a 1,000 decline in GSE forbearances. FHA/VA plan volumes held flat from the week prior. 
  
 According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, 1.75 million (3.3% of) borrowers remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans as of August 17. That population includes 1.9% of GSE, 5.8% of FHA/VA and 4.0% of portfolio-held and privately securitized mortgages.
Plan volumes are now down 110,000 (-5.9%) from the same time last month, with the rate of improvement slowing slightly in recent weeks.
Total plan starts were higher this week, primarily from a rise in re-start activity. New plan starts, though up slightly from last week, remain below the 5-week moving average.  
   Click on graph for larger image.
  
Meanwhile, plan removals hit their lowest weekly total since late May, but mainly due to the fact that review activity was low in general this past week.
 Of those plans reviewed since last Tuesday, 41% resulted in exits, up from the 36% removal rate the same time last month. Activity is poised to pick up significantly with the first wave of final forbearance expirations only weeks away.  
   
 Some 200,000 plans are currently slated for review through the final two weeks of August, with approximately one-third of those reaching their final expiration based on current allowable forbearance term lengths. Volumes of final expirations will increase significantly in September and October.

극중지계 2권. 대한민국 대표 중국 싱크탱크 니어재단과 당대 최고의 중국 경제 전문가들이 2년에 걸친 기획과 탐구, 토론으로 완성한 생존, 자강, 국익의 길. 미중 간 전략적 경쟁은 패권경쟁 양상을 띠고 있고, 점차 체제와 가치 전쟁으로 확대되고 있다. 이 과정에서 중국의 팽창주의적 굴기는 우리에게 중대한 위협이 되고 있다. 기존의 미국적 패권 질서에 편입되어 있던 상황을 위협하고, 중국적 질서와 가치, 중국의 국익을 강요할 가능성이 커지고 있다.

강성대국 중국을 극복하기 위한 비방서로서의, 극중지계(克中之計)인 책. 이 책은 시진핑식 노선이 우리의 주권과 생존권을 어떻게 흔들어놓을지 주시하면서 충돌이나 예속이 아닌 공생의 관계 방정식을 찾아 나간다. 거대한 전환의 시대에 재앙으로 빠지지 않고, 변화를 기회를 바꾸는 방안을 제시한다.

미래 산업과 글로벌 경제의 불확실성에도, 여전히 통계와 데이터에 기반을 둔 시장 분석은 놓칠 수 없는 유효한 수단이다. 데이터에 기반을 둔 정보 분석은 주관적 판단의 오류를 줄여주는 현실적 도구로써, 이는 이 보고서가 1989년 이후 매년 발행되는 이유이기도 하다.

특히 최근처럼 산업 간 경계가 허물어지고, 융합 기술이 중요한 경쟁력의 원천이 되고, 사업의 핵심 축으로 자리 잡게 되면서 인접 산업과 이 업종에 대한 이해와 분석은 점점 더 그 가치가 중요해져 가고 있다. 이에 이 보고서는 사업 기획과 마케팅 전략 수립에 도움을 주고자 국내 주요 산업과 시장에 대한 폭넓은 2차 자료를 최대한 망라해 소개하고 있다.

아시아를 대표하는 전문 미래학자 최윤식 박사의 새 책. 전작 《빅체인지, 코로나19 이후 미래 시나리오》에서 코로나19가 세계 경제에 미칠 영향력을 예고했다면, 이번에는 포스트 코로나 시대에 바이든 대통령의 경제 정책이 주요 선진국과 신흥국에 미칠 영향력을 예측한다.

신자유주의를 폐기하고 새로운 뉴딜 정책을 꺼내든 바이든의 결단은 주식시장을 비롯한 국제 금융시장과 각국 실물경제에 어떤 영향을 미칠까? 우리는 언제 어느 국가의 어떤 산업에 투자해야 최대의 이익을 얻을 수 있을까? 바이든 정부의 움직임을 주시하면 답이 보인다.

This column argues that the assessment of the Phillips curve has become more complicated due to numerous confounding factors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm gathering existing home data for many local markets, and I'm watching inventory very closely this year.

The table below shows some local market data for July.
As I noted in Some thoughts on Housing Inventory 
The key for housing in 2021 will be inventory. If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in house prices. However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.
Although inventory in these areas is down about 33% year-over-year, inventory is up 13.5% month-to-month (and up 26.5% over the last two months).  Seasonally we'd usually expect a small increase in inventory from June to July - so some of this increase is seasonal (as opposed to a shift in the market).   

It does appear inventory bottomed seasonally in March.  And inventory is still historically very low, but increasing more than just seasonal.

이제껏 세상에 나온 탈성장론들은 체제비판론, 탈성장 미래사회 스케치 수준을 넘지 못했었다. 반면, 탈성장 운동은 이 책 덕분에 비로소 사회경제 시스템 전환 계획을 품은 현실 정치 운동으로 진화하고 있다. 경제성장 없는 그린뉴딜, UBI(보편 기본 소득), UCI(보편 돌봄 소득), UBS(보편 기본 서비스), 커먼스 회복, 노동시간 단축, 공공 금융 제도. 평등한 탈탄소사회라는 미래로 이행하는 데 필요하다고 저자들이 말하는 사회 개혁 정책들이다.

또한 이 책은 우리 시대를 역사적 대전환기라는 인식하에, 어떤 대전환의 비전이 필요한지, 그 청사진을 분명히 제시하고 있어서 눈길을 끈다. 그것은 행복, 평등, 지속가능성, 공동체적 삶, 돌봄, 소박함의 가치를 우선시하며 더 적은 것으로 더 잘 사는 삶이다.

‘파이낸스’라고 하면 ‘기업 재무(corporate finance)’만을 떠올리는 사람이 많다. 하지만 자세히 들여다보면 기업뿐만 아니라 가정과 일상에서도 파이낸스 사고(재무적 사고)를 필요로 한다. 파이낸스 사고법이란 미래에 끼칠 모든 영향을 돈으로 환산하여 파악하고, 상정된 안을 비교해서 가장 적절한 안을 선택하는 방법이다. 일본 디즈니와 맥도날드의 공인회계사인 저자와 함께 인생의 다양한 의사결정을 내리는 데 도움을 주는 파이낸스 사고법을 알아보자.

시작하며

STEP 0 회계 vs. 파이낸스
파이낸스는 다양한 의사결정에 활용할 수 있다
회계는 형식, 파이낸스는 사고방식
회계는 과거, 파이낸스는 미래
회계는 의견, 파이낸스는 사실
회계적 사고와 파이낸스적 사고로 내 집 마련을 생각하다

STEP 1 ‘보이지 않는 비용’을 파악한다
선택을 했더라면 얻을 수 있었던 이익을 비용으로 인식하는 것이 ‘기회비용’
기회비용을 파악하여 미래 매출을 창출한다
과거에 지출한 돈인 ‘매몰 비용’에 대해서는 감정을 배제하고 판단한다
매몰 비용을 무시했어야 할 비즈니스 사례
매몰 비용의 함정을 피하려면 ‘중간 점검’ 시기를 설정해야 한다
매몰 비용을 역으로 이용한다
‘인건비’는 비용 그 자체
‘현금’은 돈을 지출하게 만드는 ‘보이지 않는 비용’
‘시간’을 비용으로 환산한다
파이낸스적 사고를 특정 비용 항목에 국한하여 생각하지 않는다
비용은 신중하게 예측한다

STEP 2 시간가치를 고려한다
장기간에 걸쳐 영향을 미치는 ‘고정비’는 최소한으로 줄인다
고정비보다 더 고정적인 ‘초기 투자 비용
‘회수 기간’은 가능한 짧게 생각한다
‘현금’을 마련하는 데는 비용이 든다
‘언제?’에 따라 돈의 가치는 다르다

STEP 3 차이를 비교한다
비교란 ‘차이점’에 주목하는 것
‘판단 기준’을 정한다
선택지를 빠짐없이 열거하고, 마지막에 비교한다
복수의 안건을 검토할 때는 ‘허들 레이트’를 사용한다
‘금액 = NPV’와 ‘이율 = IRR’을 구분하여 비교한다

STEP 4 수치를 변환하고 이미지를 연상한다
큰 숫자일수록 쉬운 단위로 변환하여 생각한다
단위를 변환하면 ‘방법’이 보인다
단위를 변환하여 구분하면 시기적절한 ‘정기적 관측’이 가능하다
관리 항목을 구분하면 ‘개인의 목표’가 보인다
회사 내에는 수많은 KPI가 존재한다
KPI는 업종의 특성을 고려하여 정한다
‘비중’과 ‘수익’의 관점에서 매출을 늘린다
부문마다 수익성을 구분하면 개별 ‘부문의 최적화’라는 부작용이 발생한다

컴퓨터 프로그래밍을 배우는 데에 있어서 기초가 되는 논리들을 이해하고, 이를 활용하여 문제를 풀어가면서 프로그램 제작 훈련을 돕기 위해 만들어진 책이다. 이 훈련의 특징은 프로그래밍의 기초부터 응용까지 15단계로 나누어 각 단계마다 필요한 논리와 개념 설명은 최소한으로 줄이고, 간단한 예제를 통해 이해할 수 있도록 설명한다. 

그러므로 다른 C언어 도서에서 다루는 구체적인 문법들이나 이론적인 설명을 자세하게 다루지 않는다. 각 단계마다 조금씩 수준을 높여 가면서 반복되는 실습문제들을 풀게 되는데, 이런 과정을 거치면서 프로그래밍 논리와 문제해결 능력이 향상되도록 하였다.

경기연구원이 기획하고 이재명 경기도지사가 추천한 ‘공정과 지속가능 프로젝트’ 경제 편이다. 이 책은 포스트 코로나 시대에 한국 경제의 구조적 문제점을 진단하고 이를 극복할 공정하고 지속가능한 경제질서와 새로운 경제 패러다임을 모색한다.

코로나19로 인해 한국 경제의 극심한 이중구조가 고스란히 드러나고 있다. 비정규직 노동자, 영세 자영업자, 저소득 계층은 더 큰 고통을 감내해야 하는 상황이다. 대기업이 성장을 기록하는 동안 중소기업은 매출과 이익 저하에 시달리며 생존을 염려하고 있다. 하위 저소득가구의 근로소득은 10%이상 감소했고, 영세 자영업은 사회적 거리 두기를 견디지 못해 폐업하고 있다. 이런 양극화 심화는 현재 소득의 격차로 끝나지 않고 점점 심화되어 불평등이 대물림될 가능성이 크다. 한국 경제는 새로운 패러다임을 구축해야 할 절박한 시점에 처했다.

《지속가능한 공정경제》는 이런 위기와 기회의 측면을 면밀하게 살펴서 지속가능한 공정경제를 위한 화두에 답하고자 한다. 포스트 코로나 시대에 새로운 경제 패러다임이 지향해야 할 시대적 가치는 무엇인지, 새로운 경제질서는 어떤 모습이고 기존 경제질서는 어떻게 재구조화되어야 하는지, 미래지향적 경제질서를 구현하기 위한 정부의 역할과 정책 기준은 무엇이어야 하는지 등을 탐색한다.

자본주의 물질문명이 형성되는 역사의 과정을 쉽고 친절하게, 역사학계의 최신 연구 성과를 바탕으로 깊이 있게 제시하는 책. 지금 우리가 누리는 물질문명이 어떻게 출현하고 발전했는지 동ㆍ서양과 한국을 가로지르고 과거와 현재를 넘나들며 폭넓게 조망한다. 그럼으로써 세계사적 관점에서 현재의 세계를 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다. 

이 책은 300년 동안 급속도로 진행된 이 세계의 변화가 도대체 무엇이었는지 구체적 사실(史實)로 톺아보는데, 저자는 물질문명을 이루어낸 원동력의 범주를 세 가지로 분석한다. 하나는 물질생활을 풍요롭게 만드는 제일 조건인 ‘생산 증대’, 그리고 생산 증대를 가능하게 한 ‘과학 기술의 비약적 발전’, 나머지 하나는 윤택한 생활의 최종 결과이자 오늘날 문명을 지배하는 ‘소비’다.
