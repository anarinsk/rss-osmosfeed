        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an ongoing merger wave in the US hospital industry, but it remains an open question how hospital mergers change, or fail to change, hospital behavior, performance, and outcomes. In this research, we open the “black box” of practices within hospitals in the context of a mega-merger between two large for-profit chains. Benchmarking the effects of the merger against the acquirer’s stated aims, we show that they achieved some of their goals: they harmonized their electronic medical records and sent managers to target hospitals; after the acquisition, managerial processes were similar across hospitals in the merged chain. However, these interventions failed to drive detectable gains in profitability or patient outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the importance of hospital organizations and internal processes for merger research and policy in health care and the economy more generally.]]></summary>

Using proprietary data from a leading Chinese FinTech company, we study Fintech's role in ending financial repression in China through the introduction of a money market fund with deposit-like features available through an already widely-adopted household payment platform.  Cities and banks whose depositor base is more exposed to FinTech see greater deposit outflows. Importantly, exposed banks respond to FinTech competition by offering competing products with market interest rates. FinTech thus facilitates a bottom-up interest rate liberalization.]]></summary>

Domestic retail investors have a greater presence in Chinese A shares, and foreign institutions are relatively more prevalent in B shares. These differences result from currency conversion restrictions and mandated investment quotas. We find that only B shares exhibit momentum and earnings drift, and only A shares exhibit monthly reversals. Institutional ownership strengthens momentum in B shares. These patterns accord with a setting where momentum is caused by informed investors who underreact to fundamental signals, and short-term reversals represent premia to absorb the demands of noise traders. Overall, our findings confirm that clienteles matter in generating stock return predictability from past returns.]]></summary>

We argue that innovation and autocracy can be mutually reinforcing when: (i) the new technology bolsters the autocrat’s power; and (ii) the autocrat’s demand for the technology stimulates further innovation in applications beyond those benefiting it directly. We test for such a mutually reinforcing relationship in the context of facial recognition AI in China. To do so, we gather comprehensive data on AI firms and government procurement contracts, as well as on social unrest across China during the last decade. We first show that autocrats benefit from AI: local unrest leads to greater government procurement of facial recognition AI, and increased AI procurement suppresses subsequent unrest. We then show that AI innovation benefits from autocrats’ suppression of unrest: the contracted AI firms innovate more both for the government and commercial markets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of sustained AI innovation under the Chinese regime: AI innovation entrenches the regime, and the regime’s investment in AI for political control stimulates further frontier innovation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper analyzes a simple model of infectious disease where the incentives for individuals to reduce risks through endogenous social distancing take straightforward cost-benefit form. Since disease is transmitted through social interactions, the threat of spread of infection poses a collective action problem. Policy interventions such as lockdowns, testing, and mask-wearing serve, in part, as substitutes for social distancing. Provision of a vaccination is the only intervention that unambiguously reduces both the peak infection level and the herd immunity level of infection. Adoption of vaccination remains limited in a decentralized equilibrium, with resulting reproductive rate of disease Rt > 1 at the conclusion of vaccination. Vaccine mandates yield increases in vaccination rates and corresponding reductions in future infection rates but do not increase expected payoffs to individuals.]]></summary>

We leverage variation in the number of mental healthcare offices within a county over the period 1999 to 2016 in a two-way fixed-effects model. Office-based treatment is the most common modality of mental healthcare received by juveniles. We find that ten additional office-based mental healthcare providers in a county leads a decrease of 2.3% to 2.6% in the per capita costs to society of juvenile arrest. Findings are similar for arrest rates although often less precise, which suggests that accounting for social costs is empirically important. Crime imposes substantial costs on society and individuals, and interventions during early life can have more pronounced effects than those received at later stages, therefore our results imply increased juvenile access to mental healthcare may have an unintended benefit for the current and future generations.]]></summary>

Is invention becoming a winner-takes-all race? We explore the rising spatial concentration of patents and identify an underlying stability in their distribution. Software patents have exploded to account for about half of patents today, and these patents are highly concentrated in tech centers. Tech centers also account for a growing share of non-software patents, but the reallocation, by contrast, is entirely from the five largest population centers in 1980. Non-software patenting is stable for most cities, with anchor tenants like universities playing important roles, suggesting the growing concentration of invention may be nearing its end. Immigrant inventors and new businesses aided in the spatial transformation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using a large survey panel that connects household shopping behavior with individual health information, this paper documents correlations between self reported depression and the size and composition of shopping baskets. First, we find that roughly 16% of individuals report suffering from depression and over 30% of households have at least one member who reports suffering from depression. Households with a member suffering from depression exhibit striking differences in shopping behavior: they spend less overall, visit grocery stores less and convenience stores more frequently and spend a smaller share of their baskets on fresh produce and alcohol but a larger share on tobacco. They spend similar shares on unhealthy foods like cakes, candy, and salty snacks. These cross-sectional correlations hold within counties, suggesting that they are not driven by region specific demographics or preferences that are incidentally correlated with depression status. They also hold when considering only single-member households. However, we rule out large differences in shopping behavior within households as they change depression status. Further, using the take-up of antidepressants as an event, we document little change in shopping in response to treatment. With our results, we discuss takeaways for the economic impact of depression and for decision modeling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate the effect of hiring skilled immigrant employees on the performance of organizations. This relationship has been difficult to establish in prior work due to theoretical ambiguity, limited data, and inherent endogeneity. We overcome these difficulties by studying European football (soccer) clubs during 1990-2020. Detailed microdata from this setting offers unusual transparency on the migration and hiring of talent and their contribution to collective performance. Further, the industry is characterized by country-level rule changes that govern the number of immigrant players clubs can hire. Using these rule changes as the basis for instrumental variables, we find a positive local average treatment effect of the number of immigrant players on the club’s in-game performance. To examine the theoretical mechanisms, we explore whether immigrants cause superior performance because they are more talented than natives or because they enhance the national diversity of their clubs. We find strong evidence for the talent mechanism. We find contingent evidence for the national diversity mechanism: national diversity has a positive relationship with club performance only when the club employs an immigrant manager (coach). The presence of an immigrant manager also strengthens the positive relationship between the number of immigrant players and club performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most important puzzles in microfinance is the low rate of borrower graduation to larger, more flexible loans. Utilizing observational and experimental data from a large Chilean microfinance institution, we demonstrate that loan officers impede borrower graduation due to common features of their compensation contracts. Our partner lender offers both microloans and larger, more flexible graduation loans, and relies on loan officer endorsements to determine borrower graduation. Loan officers are rewarded for the size of their portfolio and repayment, and so are implicitly penalized when good borrowers graduate. In an experiment designed to isolate strategic disclosure, we modify compensation to reduce this implicit penalty and document that loan officers withheld endorsements of their most qualified borrowers prior to the shift. Graduated borrowers endorsed after the shift are 34% more profitable for our partner lender than those endorsed beforehand. A back-of-the- envelope calculation suggests that strategic behavior of loan officers accounts for $4.8-29.2 billion in lost social value from forgone borrower graduations in microfinance worldwide. Our experimental design may prove useful for other experiments within firms.]]></summary>

We elicit (b), (c), and (d) with a daily online survey in the US from March to August 2020 (N ≈ 13,900).
We have three main findings: (1) beliefs elicited as infection case counts are closely related to present and future official case-count information; however (2) beliefs elicited as risk perceptions—i.e., the chance to get infected—are inconsistent with those case-count beliefs, even when mathematically, they should be identical; notably, (3) it is the latter—the risk perceptions—that are significantly better predictors of reported behavior than the former.
Together, these findings suggest that researchers and policymakers, who increasingly engage in direct elicitation and communication of numeric measures of uncertainty, may get very different outcomes, depending on which measures they use. We discuss potential implications for public communication of health-risk information.]]></summary>

Our main result is that subjects that started inside echo chambers became more polarized when these two strategies were implemented. The only scenario where they did not become more polarized is when they did not even experience the political event. Interestingly, subjects that were outside echo chambers before our study began experienced no change (or a reduction) in polarization.

This implies that the variation in effects across our students is wider than the spread of mean effects across all randomized evaluations of developing country education interventions in the literature. This very effective program does indeed leave some students behind. At the same time, we do not learn much from our analyses that attempt to determine which students benefit more or less from the program. We reject rank preservation, and the weaker assumption of stochastic increasingness leaves wide bounds on quantile-specific average treatment effects. Neither conventional nor machine-learning approaches to estimating systematic heterogeneity capture more than a small fraction of the variation in impacts given our available candidate moderators.]]></summary>

The first part focuses on how to define and measure various dimensions of upgrading --- learning, quality upgrading, technology adoption, and product innovation. The second part takes stock of recent micro-empirical evidence on the drivers of upgrading, classifying them as output-side drivers, input-side drivers, or drivers of know-how.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Investing according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria is gaining momentum. Most environmental performance indices focus only on the tonnage of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. This paper proposes an index covering eight pollutants expressed in monetary damage. Inclusion of multiple pollutants reflects a broader range of reputational and regulatory risks. Monetization appropriately weights emissions. CO₂ dominates the mass of other pollutants, yet the marginal damages from other pollutants are larger than CO₂. In the U.S. utility sector from 2014 to 2017, indices which only track CO₂ mischaracterize firms’ environmental performance and underestimate its effect on financial outcomes relative to the multipollutant index. Dirtier firms exhibit lower share prices and higher forward returns. The effect is twice as large for the multipollutant index compared to CO₂. Analysts’ earnings forecasts for dirtier firms systematically undershoot actuals. Earnings errors are between three and five times more sensitive to the multipollutant index than to CO₂. The multipollutant index may suggest new management strategies to financial market participants relative to those based on carbon intensity. ESG disclosure standards based on the new index are more likely to affect financial outcomes, capital allocation decisions, and firm behavior than disclosure of carbon intensity.]]></summary>

We exploit idiosyncratic delays in project completion and the unexpected end of the Sino-Soviet Alliance, due to which some projects received Soviet technology embedded in capital goods and know-how, while others were eventually realized by China alone using domestic technology. We find that receiving both Soviet technology and know-how had large, persistent effects on plant performance, while the effects of receiving only Soviet capital goods were short-lived.

We show that an increase in the dollar funding risk leads to a rise in the convenience yield and an appreciation of the dollar, as banks scramble for dollars.

By doing so, they tilt the division of surplus along an intermediation chain in their favor, while at the same time reducing aggregate surplus. The network is inefficient relative to a constrained efficient benchmark since banks who make risky investments “overconnect”, exposing themselves to excessive counterparty risk, while banks who mainly provide funding end up with too few connections.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a model with cheap talk, employers can send messages about their willingness to pay for higher ability workers, which job-seekers can use to direct their search and tailor their wage bid. Introducing such messages leads—under certain conditions—to an informative separating equilibrium which affects the number of applications, types of applications, and wage bids across firms. This model is used to interpret an experiment conducted in a large online labor market: employers were given the opportunity to state their relative willingness to pay for more experienced workers, and workers can easily condition their search on this information. Preferences were collected for all employers, but only treated employers had their signal revealed to job-seekers. In response to revelation of the cheap talk signal, job-seekers targeted their applications to employers of the right “type” and they tailored their wage bids, affecting who was matched to whom and at what wage. The treatment increased measures of match quality through better sorting, illustrating the power of cheap talk to improve market outcomes.]]></summary>

More than 80 percent of these deaths are attributable to unsafe drinking water. Drinking water can be made safe through dilute chlorine solution, but take-up of this technology has been low. Previous work has shown that free community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution through “dispensers” – reservoirs of chlorine solution at water sources that make chlorination easy and free – increases take-up of chlorination. However, it has remained unclear whether this increase also translates into reduced mortality. Here we show that four years of community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution in rural Kenya reduces all-cause under-5 mortality by 1.4 percentage points (95% CI: 0.3 pp, 2.5 pp), a 63% reduction relative to control. We estimate that at USD 25 per DALY averted, free provision of chlorine solution is twenty times more cost-effective than the WHO “highly cost-effective” threshold.]]></summary>

For preference dimensions that are systematically biased toward the same gender across the globe, differences between men and women are larger in more gender-equal countries. In contrast, for preference dimensions with a gender bias that varies across countries, the opposite holds. This finding takes an important step toward reconciling evolutionary psychology and social role theory as they relate to gender.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study how salary history disclosures affect employer demand by using a novel, two-sided field experiment featuring hundreds of recruiters reviewing over 2000 job applications. We randomize the presence of salary history questions as well as candidates' disclosures. We find that employers make negative inferences about non-disclosing candidates, and view salary history as a stronger signal about competing options than worker quality. Disclosures by men (and other highly-paid candidates) yield higher salary offers, however they are negative signals of value (net of salary), and thus yield fewer callbacks. Male wage premiums are regarded as a weaker signal of quality than other sources (such as the premiums from working at higher paying firms, or being well-paid compared to peers). Recruiters correctly anticipate that women are less likely to disclose salary history at any level, and punish women less than men for silence. In our simulation of bans, we find no evidence that bans affect the gender ratio of callback choices, but find large reductions in gender inequality in salary offers among candidates called back. However, salary offers are lower overall (especially for men). A theoretical framework shows how these effects may differ by key properties of labor markets.]]></summary>

The data also permit novel IV estimation that isolates variation in parental cognitive skills due to school and peer quality. The between-subject and IV estimates of the key intergenerational persistence parameter are strikingly similar and close at about 0.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic theories suggest that common pool resources are subject to overexploitation. Community-based resource management approaches may ameliorate “tragedy of the commons” effects. Using a randomized evaluation in Namibia’s communal rangelands, we find that a comprehensive four-year program to support community-based rangeland and cattle management led to persistent and large improvements for eight of thirteen indices of social and behavioral outcomes. Effects on rangeland health, cattle productivity and household economics, however, were either negative or nil. Positive impacts on community resource management may have been offset by communities’ inability to control grazing by non-participating herds and inhibited by an unresponsive rangeland sub-system. This juxtaposition, in which measurable improvements in community resource management did not translate into better outcomes for households or rangeland health, demonstrates the fragility of the causal pathway from program implementation to intended socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. It also points to challenges for improving climate change–adaptation strategies.]]></summary>

We find that between 1990-2007, import competition due to the “China Shock” lowered union certification elections by 4.5% among workers in manufacturing industries directly exposed to it, and by 8.8% among workers indirectly exposed through its effect on their local labor market. Consistent with a simple model of workers’ decision to seek union representa- tion, we show that direct exposure lowered the expected wage gain from unionization, whereas indirect exposure increased the cost of job loss, both of which discourage worker organizing.]]></summary>

Are the differing results because a hot hand is only present in similar shots or because testing for the hot hand in game situations is difficult? Combining repeated shots in a location and shots across locations, the NBA 3-Point Contests mimics game situations without many of the confounding factors. Using data on the 1986-2019 contests, we find a hot hand, but only within shot locations. Shooting streaks increase a hot hand only if a player makes his previous shot and only within locations. Even making three shots in a row has no effect on making the next shot if a player moves locations. Our results suggest that any hot hand in basketball is only present in extremely similar shooting situations and likely not in the run-of-play.]]></summary>

Most of the 5.0mn persons who have exited the labor force since the start of the pandemic are over age 55 (3.4mn), largely reflecting early (1.5mn) and natural (1mn) retirements that likely won’t reverse. The outlook for prime-age persons who have exited the labor force (1.7mn) is more positive, since very few are discouraged and most still view their exits as temporary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings was little changed at 10.4 million on the last business day of September, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires and total separations were little changed at 6.5  million and 6.2 million, respectively. Within separations, the quits level and rate increased to a series  high of 4.4 million and 3.0 percent, respectively. The layoffs and discharges rate was unchanged at 0.9  percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for September, the most recent employment report was for October.
 Click on graph for larger image.
Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spike in layoffs and discharges in March  2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings decreased in September to 10.438 million from 10.629 million in August.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 58% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 34% year-over-year to a new record high.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for "quits").]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This data is as of November 9th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Drop Below 2% Entering November
Forbearance plan exit volumes increased week-over-week heading into November as the share of mortgage loans in forbearance fell below 2% for the first time since the early stages of the pandemic.
According to our McDash Flash daily mortgage performance dataset, the number of loans in active forbearance fell 123,000 (-10.8%). The week’s strongest declines were among loans held in bank portfolios and private label securities, which recorded a reduction of 59,000 (-15.9%). FHA/VA plans also showed significant improvement, declining by 48,000 (-11.3), while GSE loans in forbearance plans decreased by 16,000 (-4.8%).
As of November 9, 1.01 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 1.9% of all active mortgages, including 1.2% of GSE, 3.1% of FHA/VA and 2.4% of portfolio/PLS loans.

  Nearly 300,000 borrowers have left their plans over the past two weeks down from 455,000 over the same two-week period last month as we hit the downslope of exit activity. That said, more than 250,000 plans are still listed with October/November reviews for extension/removal. Half of those are expected to reach final expiration, which could lead to continued improvement, albeit at a slower pace, in the weeks ahead.
Plan entries were down 9% from a week ago, logging one of the lowest weeks in terms of new entries since the onset of the pandemic.

Excerpt: 
This is the third look at local markets in October. This update adds Albuquerque, Atlanta, Colorado, Houston, Jacksonville, Minnesota, Portland, Sacramento and Santa Clara.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported so far in October. For these markets, inventory was down 7.9% in October MoM from September, and down 25.1% YoY.
Of the markets that have reported so far, inventories in Jacksonville and San Diego are at record lows.  Sacramento is the only market so far with inventory up YoY in October.
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 22.9% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is slightly larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market.

이와나미 시리즈. 노벨 경제학상 후보로 거론되기로 했던 세계적인 경제학자 모리시마 미치오. 2004년 사망했지만, 이미 국내에서도 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》 등으로 유명한 그는 LSE 교수로 역임하면서 세계적으로 이름을 날리기 시작했다. 그는 친 자본주의와 자유주의 성향인  노벨 경제학상 선정 위원회의 경향에 맞지 않아 경제학상 수상에는 실패했으나, 일본 경제 위기를 진단하는 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》로 우리에게도 많은 교훈을 준다. 

이 책은 모리시마 미치오가 NHK에서 강의한 내용을 바탕으로 마르크스, 미제스, 케인스를 추가하여 11명의 유명 경제학자들의 사상에 관해 설명하고 있다. 방송을 기본으로 했기 때문에 어려운 근대경제학 역사를 좀 더 쉽고 정확하게 이해하는 데 도움이 된다.

근대경제학이 마주한 당시 시대 상황은 두 차례 세계대전과 대공황으로 점철된 격변의 시기였다. 그렇기에 당연히 새로운 경제 체제가 모색되었고, 많은 경제학자들이 경제학과 사회학의 종합화를 제창하였다. 저자 역시 이러한 경제학의 과제가 21세기까지도 유효하다고 보고 이 책을 집필하였다. 

책에 서술한 경제학자들이 자기 분야의 협소한 경제이론을 파고들기만 한 학자가 아닌 인간과 사회의 큰 틀에서 경제를 바라본 학자들 위주로 선정한 것도 그러한 까닭이다. 이것이 이 책의 가장 큰 장점이라 하겠다.

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.

This column examines the representation of women in undergraduate economics degrees in 25 European countries during 2014–2018. The ratio of women to men in economics, controlling for gender differences in enrolment, has been around 0.6 on average and is stable or decreasing. Increased representation of women economists is important for more balanced policy recommendations, and the authors discuss how this might be achieved.]]></summary>

This column reveals that the majority of the panel thinks the sequence of fiscal rules in place in the UK since 1997 have caused a material reduction in UK public debt. However, twice as many panellists thought these rules harmed the conduct of macroeconomic policy than those that thought they helped. Going forward, a majority of the panel believes that well-designed rules limiting public deficits or debts would best improve the conduct of macroeconomic policy, but nearly a third would scrap fiscal rules altogether.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
We are being flooded with housing stories.  Will house prices decline or will price growth just slow?  Does the US have a housing shortage?   If mortgage rates rise to 4%, will that “halt the housing market” as Ivy Zelman said on CNBC?
Although my crystal ball is cloudy at this point, I believe inventory will tell the tale.  That is why I watch inventory closely.  Not just the monthly existing home sales report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the monthly new home sales report from the Census Bureau.  I also use weekly data from Altos Research (See Altos’ Mike Simonsen’s weekly presentation on YouTube).
And I track inventory and sales for 30+ local markets each month.
...
My Spidey senses are tingling, however it isn't obvious why this time - or what the outcome will be.
But I believe one thing is certain: inventory will tell the tale!

The monthly all items seasonally adjusted increase was broad-based, with increases in the indexes for energy, shelter, food, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles among the larger contributors. The energy index rose 4.8 percent over the month, as the gasoline index increased 6.1 percent and the other major energy component indexes also rose. The food index increased 0.9 percent as the index for food at home rose 1.0 percent.
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in October after increasing 0.2 percent in September. Most component indexes increased over the month. Along with shelter, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles, the indexes for medical care, for household furnishing and operations, and for recreation all increased in October. The indexes for airline fares and for alcoholic beverages were among the few to decline over the month.
The all items index rose 6.2 percent for the 12 months ending October, the large st 12-month increase since the period ending November 1990. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.6 percent over the last 12 months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending August 1991.

Excerpt: 
Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported so far in October.  For these markets, inventory was down 9.6% in October MoM from September, and down 30.4% YoY.
Inventory in San Diego is at an all time low!
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these eight markets were down 27.4% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market (but this is just 8 early reporting markets).

I'm looking at data for some second home markets - and I'm tracking those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through October 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.
  
   Click on graph for larger image.
Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Currently inventory is still very low - above the record low set early in 2021, but down YoY - and prices are up sharply YoY.   

This will be interesting to watch, but so far there isn't any evidence of a 2nd home slowdown in these numbers (The fires don't seem to have impacted these numbers either).]]></summary>

모든 국민에게 조건 없이 일정한 금액의 돈을 정기적으로 지급하는 기본소득. 모두에게 속한 ‘공유부’를 분배하자는 것이다 보니 돈이 많은 부자에게도 지급한다. 게다가 일을 하지 않아도 주는 무조건성의 원칙 때문에 자칫 사람들의 노동의욕을 꺾는 것은 아닐지, 기본소득 도입으로 선별 복지의 수혜자들에게는 오히려 복지가 줄어드는 것은 아닐지 의문이 꼬리에 꼬리를 문다.

기본소득이 화두가 되면서 여전히 많은 사람들이 의구심을 갖고 있다. 하지만, 소모적인 논쟁 대신 기본소득이 정확히 어떤 개념이며, 어떤 원칙을 가진 제도인지 꼼꼼하게 알아볼 필요가 있다. 

어려운 경제개념을 쉽고 재미있게 이해할 수 있도록 만화로 구성된 이 책은 기본소득의 원리와 5대 원칙, 기본소득이 탄생한 역사적 배경과 경제철학을 소개하는 것은 물론이고, 기본소득을 둘러싼 여러 의혹들을 명쾌하게 해명, 실제 입법이 되려면 어떤 숙의 과정이 필요한지, 재원 마련은 어떻게 하는지, 적정한 지급액은 얼마로 추정하는지 등 기본소득을 둘러싼 모든 개념과 궁금증을 해소해준다.

‘금의 가격’은 전 세계적인 경제 위기 때마나 가파른 상승세를 보이며 급등했다. 멀게는 1929년 대공황 때부터 가깝게는 2008년 세계금융위기를 거치며 급등을 반복, 2011년에는 1온스당 장중 1,900달러 선을 돌파하며 사상 최고점을 찍었다. 이를 통해, 경제 위기→양적완화→달러 가치 하락→금의 급등으로 이어지는 흐름이 공식처럼 굳어졌다.

2019년, 코로나 팬데믹이 전 세계를 강타하고, 각국의 경제가 위기에 빠지자, 다시 ‘금의 가격’이 요동치고 있다. 거기에 더해, 이미 바닥을 드러낸 금의 추정 매장량과 달러의 대량 공급 등이 과거 경제 위기 때보다 금의 가격 상승 요인을 더욱 풍부하게 뒷받침하고 있다. 2008년 세계금융위기 때 위기를 기회로 바꿨던 전설적 투자가들이 다시 금에 집중하는 이유다.

반세기 전에 일어난 대변화
1980년- 버블화된 금
위기 시의 달러 뒤에 가라앉은 금
전환기가 된 2000년
2008년 리먼 쇼크 직후 금의 움직임

구독경제는, 사용자(구독자)가 일정 기간 동안 일정 금액, 즉 구독료를 내고 원하는 상품이나 서비스를 제공받는 경제활동을 말한다. 이전부터 있었지만, 새롭게 주목받고 있는 유통 서비스이다. 용도에 따라 변화를 추구하고 그에 따른 경험을 누리는 것, 그것이 주는 가치가 매우 중요해진 요즘 시기에 주목하지 않을 수 없다.

현 MZ세대는 직접 하는 요리나, 청소 등 집안일에 들어가는 시간을 아끼고 출퇴근 시간에 들어가는 시간을 아껴서 자신에게 투자하는 것을 선호한다. 자신이 좋아하는 취미활동을 하는 데 시간과 돈과 에너지를 아끼지 않는다. 이러한 현상은 젊은 세대일수록 뚜렷하게 나타난다.

아직 경제활동을 하는 1인 가구라면 내가 가장 중요하기 때문에 무엇을 하든 가장 효율적인 방법을 찾기 마련이다. 내가 가장 즐겁고 행복해지는 방법을 우선적으로 찾으며, 나에게 다양한 경험을 주는 것들에 흔쾌히 마음을 내어줄 것이고 그것들에 가치와 의미를 부여할 것이다. 즉 이러한 소비자의 입맛에 맞추어 소비자가 원하는 유무형의 아이템을 제공한다는 것이 구독경제의 핵심이다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

이 책의 예제 코드와 함께 홈페이지 회원들에게만 제공하는 회원특전 PDF는 예제와 라이브러리 사용법 간이 매뉴얼로 성안당 홈페이지(www.cyber.co.kr) [도서몰]에 회원가입 후 [자료실]-[자료실] 바로가기에서 도서 검색을 통해 다운로드할 수 있다.

인간과 시공간이라는 물리적 한계를 넘어 그 속에서 상호 융합 및 공진화하게 될 메타버스 글로벌 시장! 지금까지 계속 관망만 해 왔다면, 이제는 마지막 기회가 될 메타버스에 과감히 탑승하길 바란다. 앞으로 AR·VR 등 XR 기반의 기업들과 AI, 블록체인 기업들이 힘을 합쳐 지속적으로 메타버스 기술 개발을 이끌어가야 할 것이다. 

메타버스 시장은 2020년 50조 원, 2023년 535조 원 이상, 2030년에는 1,700조 원가량 성장할 전망이며, 우리나라는 향후 5년간 2.6조 원의 메타버스 관련 예산을 단계적으로 집행할 예정이다. 그렇다면 그 주인공은 누가 될 것인가? 현재로서는 예측이 불가하지만 문화와 IT 기술, 콘텐츠 강국인 대한민국이 그 주인공이었으면 하는 바람이다. 그리고 그 변화의 바람에 나도 함께할 것이다.

어떻게 하면 이 시대 청년들에게 꿈과 희망을 줄 수 있을까? 이 시대적 과제에 대한 해결책을 모색하고자 뜻을 같이하는 교수 6명이 이 책을 집필하게 되었다. 더 이상 강단에서 지켜보지만 말고 시대에 역행하는 모순을 바로잡아야만 한다는 사명감에서 출발하였다. 

흔히 우리는 기술혁신이 일자리를 빼앗고 소득 양극화를 심화시킬 수 있다고 오해하기 쉽다. 그러나 이는 편견에 지나지 않으며, 불평등 사회를 조장하는 것은 기술혁신이 아니라 그 혁신을 가로막는 제도다. 그 제도 때문에 일자리가 줄어드는 것이다.

제1장 노동시장의 이중구조와 노동조합의 사회적 책임

1. 노동조합이 노동시장 양극화를 만든 모순
기형적인 한국의 노동조합
불평등을 키우는 노동조합
모순에 빠진 한국의 노동운동

2. 노동시장은 왜 단절되었는가
노동법과 노동시장의 괴리
빈익빈부익부 만드는 노동정치
민주화와 노동운동
민주노총과 전투적 노동운동의 모순
노사정의 사회적 대화의 실패
노동의 경제민주화와 기울어진 정책무대
기업의 사회적 책임 및 공공성 강화와 고용의 왜곡
노동조합의 비정상적 운영 관행
낙후된 노동법

3. 노동조합의 사회적 책임은 우리나라만의 문제인가
노동조합의 사회적 책임
자본주의와 노동조합의 사회적 책임
정부와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：미국
정치와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：영국
복지와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：스웨덴
기술혁신과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：독일
고용과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：프랑스와 남부 유럽

4. 디지털 시대의 노동, 무엇을 어떻게 할 것인가
디지털 시대의 노동시장과 노동조합
손 놓고 있는 한국
노동개혁의 방향
일자리문제의 시각부터 바로잡자
중소기업을 고임금 일자리로 만들자
교육훈련을 사회적 권리로 만들자
후진적인 임금고용관행을 바꾸자
노동조합은 사회적 책임 강화에 나서라
노동법을 바꾸자
정치적 결단이 요구된다

제2장 최저임금제도의 역설：2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 부작용

1. 최저임금제도, 왜 사회경제적 논란이 되었나
최저임금제도의 목적
최저임금 결정 과정
2018년~2019년 2년간 29.1% 최저임금 인상안의 문제점

2. 최저임금과 관련된 지표와 통계 자료
최저임금의 인상률 추이：2018년~2019년을 중심으로
2014년~2017년 최저임금 인상률과 인상요인
2018년~2019년 최저임금 인상률과 그 결정요인

3. 2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 영향
최저임금을 지불할 수 없는 사업장 증가：최저임금 미만율 증가
근로자 임금결정 시 정부의 과도한 영향：최저임금 영향률 증가
과도한 최저임금 인상에 의한 소득분배 개선 악화
과도한 최저임금 인상에 ...

메타버스, OTT, 밈테크, 틱톡, 슈퍼 IP, 이커머스, 오리지널 콘텐츠…. 만약 이런 단어가 낯설다면 당신은 세상의 변화에 둔감한 사람일지 모른다. 1020세대의 전유물이라고 치부되던 뉴미디어와 그 매체가 담아내는 독창적인 콘텐츠는 이제 보편적이고 대중적인 문화로 자리 잡아가고 있다. 뿐만 아니라 유튜브와 숏폼의 인기 콘텐츠가 거시적인 사회문화 트렌드의 출발지가 되는 사례가 점차 늘어나면서, 뉴미디어 콘텐츠의 영향력이 커지고 있다.

시장이 클수록 혁신에 대한 보상은 증가하며, 이는 더 많은 혁신을 불러온다. 그러나 전 세계 인구의 0.7%에도 미치지 못하지만 세계 10위의 경제 규모를 가지게 된 우리나라는 무역을 통해서 혁신을 자극하는 효과를 누려왔다. 박지형 교수는 한국의 사례를 들어 국내의 인적·물적 자원뿐 아니라 전 세계 자원을 효과적으로 활용해야 지속적 혁신을 할 수 있다고 강조한다.

2021년 글로벌혁신지수(Global Innovation Index)에서 한국은 스위스, 스웨덴, 미국, 영국에 이어 세계 5위의 혁신국가로 평가됐다. 하지만 한국은 ‘기술 융합 역량’은 우수한 편이나 ‘창의적 사고’와 ‘공정하고 유연한 제도’의 면에서는 다른 선진국에 비해 뒤처진다. 이정민 교수는 정부가 충분한 숙려 기간과 사전 검토 기간을 거친 후 정책을 체계적으로 결정해야 엉뚱한 곳으로 투자 자원이 소모되지 않는다고 지적한다.

돈이 무엇인지 설명한다. 세계사의 여러 장면을 조명해 돈이 어떻게 만들어지고, 어떻게 발전해왔는지 알아본다. 지배자들은 돈에 개입해 주화라는 개념을 만들면서 시뇨리지를 챙기고, 지배자들의 더 큰 개입은 훗날 은행으로 발전한다. 

천재 과학자 뉴턴은 영국의 금본위제를 도입하고 이는 산업혁명과 함께 유럽 전체가 금본위제를 도입하게 되는 시발점이 된다. 사실 영국의 금본위제는 우연과 실수의 산물이며 이는 중국과 유럽 사이의 무역 불균형에서 초래한 바가 크다.

한편, 두 번의 세계 대전을 거쳐 미국의 달러는 소위 기축통화의 위치를 얻게 되는데 소위 브레튼 우즈 협약을 통해 미국 달러는 종이로 만든 금의 위치에 오르게 된다. 훗날 IMF는 SDR이라는 형태로 케인스가 주창했던 방코르를 흉내 내고 이는 현재까지도 세계 무역의 기본이 되는 통화다. 

이 밖에도 미국과 일본의 양적완화와 테이퍼링, 인플레이션과 초인플레이션, 현대 통화 이론 등을 살펴보며 미국 정책금리와 통화량의 변화도 알아본다. 전 세계를 뜨겁게 달군 비트코인도 조명한다. 비트코인은 화폐인지, 비트코인은 투자인지 투기인지, FATF와 가상자산은 무엇인지, 암호화폐와 토큰, NFT, DeFi, CBDC, DAO 비트코인과 엘살바도르의 위험한 실험, 디지털 자산의 실체도 자세히 살펴본다.

1장. 화폐의 등장
2장. 은행의 탄생
3장. 경제학의 태동과 금본위제
4장. 미국의 달러
5장. 기축통화의 탄생
6장. 명목화폐
7장. 비트코인과 가상자산

경제라는 복잡한 세계의 입구에서 갈팡질팡하는 분들을 위해 쓰인 책이다. 비즈니스는 물론이고 정치와 행정 등 모든 사회적 현상의 기초에는 경제 문제가 관련되어 있다. 하지만 일반적인 경제학 입문서나 교과서에는 추상적인 개념만 가득할 뿐, 우리의 실생활과 어떤 관련이 있는지는 찾아보기 어렵다. 

이 책은 ‘가격’이라는, 경제에서 가장 기초가 되는 키워드를 바탕으로 쓰인 책이다. 가격이 상품과 함께 태어나서 자라나는 험난한 여정을 따라가며, 가격이 수행하는 사회적 역할의 크기를 살펴보고 어떤 사람들이 어떻게 가격을 만들고 키워내는지, 그 과정을 거슬러 올라가며 확인할 것이다. 또 사회 속에 존재하는, 가격을 중심으로 한 전반적인 경제 시스템을 탐구해 나갈 것이다.

가격은 ‘우리의 생활’ 그 자체다. 이 책의 의도는 가격 결정 과정에서부터 시작된 경제가 사회에서 실제로 어떻게 작용하는지, 그 생생한 시스템을 보여 주는 것이다. 약속하건대 이 책을 읽는 사람은 누구든 경제가 무엇인지 명확하게 실감할 수 있게 될 것이다.

들어가며 - 옛날에는 주먹밥에 가격이 없었다?
프롤로그 - 가격을 통해 보는 사회 시스템

제1장 우리는 가격에 의지해 구매할 수밖에 없는가?
물건을 산다는 것은 무엇일까? 
사실 구매자는 상품에 대해 잘 모른다 
왜 내가 올 것이라는 것을 미리 알고 있을까? 
우리의 눈은 ‘이안 반사식 카메라’ 
가격은 경제의 ‘키 플레이어’

제2장 경제의 이모저모는 가격이 조정한다
전제: 시장경제란 무엇일까 
매매에서는 ‘가격’과 ‘수량’이 문제 
‘가격 메커니즘’ - 가격이 움직이면 수량도 움직인다 
경매에서는 ‘가격 메커니즘’이 작동한다 
가격 메커니즘은 그래프로 나타낼 수 있다 

제3장 투입한 생산비용을 회수할 수 있을까?
상품을 생산한다는 것은 무엇일까? 
상품이 팔리지 않는 것이 가장 큰 문제 
이익을 키우는 방법 
리스크가 적은 행동을 선택한다 
드디어 출하! 
가격은 생산자의 생명줄

제4장 가격은 어떻게 결정되는가?
현실의 시장은 어떤 시스템인가? 
시장에는 상품도 기업도 모여든다 
도매상을 중심으로 사고팔다 
경매 거래로 공정한 가격을 만든다 
시장이라는 시스템을 
경제학적으로 생각해 보자 
경매의 구조 
수요와 공급은 어떻게 가격을 결정할까

제5장 전부 팔아 치우기 위한 전략적 가격 결정
소매상에 있어 가격이란 무엇일까? 
상점에서는 가격을 어떻게 결정할까? 
소비자는 어떻게 판단할까? 
소비자의 ‘실속있는 소비’, 그 적정 가격은? 
타점포와의 가격 경쟁도 있다 
‘가격을 파는’ 전략을 취한다 
이렇게 해서 가격이 결정된다

제6장 최후의 관문, 소비자의 ‘까다로운 눈’
적절한 가격을 순간적으로 판단하는 기준은? 
쇼핑의 심리와 행동의 흐름 
우리는 매번 합리적으로 판단하지는 않는다 
판매자가 교묘히 이용하는 쇼핑 심리 
우리도 경험을 쌓아 직감을 기르자

덧붙이는 장 눈에 보이지 않는 가격도 있다
칼럼① 무료여도 괜찮을까? 
칼럼② 보이지 않는 가격에는 어떤 의미가 있을까? 
칼럼③ 가격의 끝자리를 주목하자 
칼럼④ ...

대학에서 지난 수년간 “소프트웨어 프로그래밍(파이썬)” 과목을 강의하면서 다양한 교과서를 살펴보았다. 어떤 서적은 한 학기에 파이썬 교육을 완성하기에 분량이 너무 많았고 시간이 부족해서 적절한 교과서를 찾기 쉽지 않았다. 연세대 강의는 전교의 다양한 학생들이 수강하고 있으며 거의 대부분의 수강생들이 프로그래밍 배경이 전혀 없는 상태이다. 실제 강의는 매주 강의 2시간 및 실습(LAB) 2시간으로 진행해 왔다. 이러한 요구와 여건에 맞추어 이 책을 저술하게 되었다. 

이 책은 실제 강의 내용에 기반하여 LAB 내용(연습문제의 B. 따라하기 실습 및 C. 프로그래밍 실습)을 구성하였다. 수강생들은 LAB 내용(B. 따라하기 실습)을 그대로 따라함으로써 파이썬 언어를 익히고, 간단한 프로그래밍 문제(C. 프로그래밍 실습)를 LAB 시간 내에 완성하는 방식을 따랐다. 이 책을 사용하는 모든 사람이 이와 동일한 방법으로 비교적 단시간 내에 파이썬 언어의 모든 것을 배우고 활용 능력을 발휘해 나갈 수 있을 것이다.

사람들은 비어 있는 집(공간)을 공유하거나 주차장에 세워져 있는 차로 운송 및 배송을 하며 부수입을 얻을 수 있다. 나만이 알고 있던 지식이나 창작물을 콘텐츠화해 확산시키며 구독자를 늘릴 수 있다. 카카오톡으로 메시지를 공유하거나 네이버와 구글에서 지식 검색을 하고 답변을 올리면서 데이터 생산에 참여한다. 이 데이터들은 빅테크 기업의 자산이 된다.

이처럼 플랫폼은 우리의 일상을 조금씩 바꾸고 있다. 새로 등장한 경제 방식을 제대로 활용하기 위해서는 플랫폼에 대한 정의부터 예시까지 정확한 이해가 필수다. ‘10대가 꼭 읽어야 할 사회・과학 교양 시리즈’의 열 번째 주제인 ‘플랫폼 경제’는, 동시대를 살아가는 우리 청소년들이 경험하게 될 경제사회를 이해하는 데 꼭 필요한 개념을 소개하며 미래를 준비하게 도와준다.

많은 인문학자들이 입을 모아 현재를 ‘대변혁의 시대’라고 칭한다. 전 인류를 위협하는 질병과, 경제 위기 등으로 매일 아침 우리는 변화를 맞이하고 그에 발맞추어야 하는 시대를 살고 있다. 이런 격변의 시기에 우리는 어떻게 살아가야 하는가? 한국인이 맞닥뜨린 이 존재론적 고민에 대한 해결의 실마리를 제시하기 위해, 대한민국 대표 석학 12인이 한자리에 모였다. 기후 위기 등 환경 문제(최재천, 공우석, 제임스 후퍼), 삶과 죽음을 대하는 자세(유성호, 정상훈), 코로나 이후 자본의 흐름(홍익희, 유인경), 운과 운명(강헌, 박성준) 그리고 미래를 주도할 열쇠 메타버스(김상균, 강유정, 전범선)까지. 인생을 구성하는 핵심 키워드를 놓고, 방대한 지식을 바탕으로 더 나은 삶에 대한 예리한 인사이트를 풀어 놓는다. 『한국인을 읽는다』는 이 시대에 현대인이 필수로 갖춰야 할 지식과 통찰을 묶어 놓은 현대 지성의 산물이다. 삶이 갈피를 잡지 못해 부유한다고 느끼는가? 이 책의 지식과 통찰은 당신의 삶에 지혜라는 돛을 달아줄 것이다.

1위 반도체 기업들의 경쟁력과 전략. 새로운 승자들의 도전 등 혁신과 전략의 과정을 기술 발전 사례와 데이터를 토대로 설명했던 《반도체 제국의 미래》에 최근의 혼란스러운 국내외 반도체 산업의 환경까지 모두 담아 2년 만에 개정증보판으로 새롭게 출간됐다.

기존의 알찬 구성에 진공관, 트랜지스터, 모스펫 등 진화를 거쳐 우리가 아는 반도체가 되기까지 흐름을 알 수 있도록 내용을 추가했고, 새 CEO를 영입하며 새로운 생태계 조성을 시도하는 인텔의 야심을 엿볼 수 있다. 기존 부록에서 반도체 공정에 관한 자세한 설명으로 독자의 이해를 도왔다면, 이번 개정증보판에는 향후 시장의 방향성까지 짐작할 수 있도록 했다. 

독자는 첫 번째, 팹리스 관점에서 파운드리 사업이 무엇인지 알아보고 급변하는 파운드리 시장에 관해 이해하며, 두 번째, 2021년 6월, 미국 백악관이 발표한 반도체 공급망 보고서 내용을 통해 한층 더 치열해진 각축전에서 기업이 어떤 노력을 기울일지 가늠할 수 있다.

반도체 산업의 발전과 변화 속도는 어떤 분야와도 비교할 수 없을 만큼 빠르다. 《반도체 제국의 미래》는 저자의 날카로운 시선으로 각 기업들이 구사한 전략의 구체적이고 생생한 사례, 데이터와 전문지 등을 기반으로 한 근거와 전망, 합리적인 미래 예측까지 선보였다. 이번 개정증보판…]]></summary>

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.

영국의 경제사학자이자 『존 메이너드 케인스』 전기 3부작으로 세계적 명성을 얻은 원로 경제 석학 로버트 스키델스키 교수의 최신 화제작. 2008년 글로벌 금융 위기 예측 실패 이후 별다른 진보를 보이지 못한 ‘주류 경제학(신고전주의 경제학)’의 문제점을 총체적으로 진단하고 처방을 모색한다. 모두 13개 장을 할애해 ‘방법론적 결함’에서 ‘학문적 불완전성’까지 치밀하게 살핀다. 비판의 강도가 높고 범위도 넓다.

이 책에서 스키델스키 교수는 작심하고 주류 경제학을 공격하지만, 그 의도는 경제학을 향한 깊은 믿음과 기대에 있다. 그가 보기에 경제학이야말로 인류에게 ‘더 나은 삶’을 열어줄 수 있는 가장 강력하고 현실적인 학문이기 때문이다. 그는 경제학 본연의 역할을 되찾아주고자 이 책을 썼다.

세계 제일의 케인스 전문가라는 타이틀 탓에 ‘케인스주의’로의 회귀를 주장할 것 같지만 그렇지 않고, 주류 경제학을 공격한다고 해서 비주류 경제학을 옹호하는 것도 아니다. 저자는 ‘신고전주의’가 경제학의 주류가 된 배경을 명확히 인지하되, 그 속의 심각한 결함을 바로잡아야 ‘더 나은 삶을 위한 경제학’으로의 대전환을 이룰 수 있다고 역설한다.

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.
