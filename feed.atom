        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of November 2nd.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: October Forbearance Exits Pick Up Pace in Final Week of Month
Improvement in the number of active COVID-19 forbearance plans continued this week as early entrants bumped against final expirations.
According to our McDash Flash daily mortgage performance dataset, the number of loans in active forbearance fell 85,000 (-6.9%). The week’s strongest declines were seen in FHA/VA plans, which marked a 42,000 (-9%) plan reduction. Strong improvement was also observed among GSE plans, which declined by 22,000 (-6%), as well as  those held in bank portfolios or private label securities, (-21,000, -5.3%).
As of Nov. 2, 1.14 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 2.1% of all active mortgages, including 1.2% of GSE, 3.5% FHA/VA and 2.8% of portfolio/PLS loans.

  Active plans are now down 332,000 (-23%) from the same time last month, as the first wave of forbearance entrants continue to reach their final expirations. Further improvement is likely next week as well, given the 129,000 reviews still scheduled for October, 75% of which are expected to be final expirations.
Finally, forbearance plan starts decreased 8% this week, with plan restart activity falling to its lowest level since early October.

U.S. rail volumes continue to be impacted by supply chain issues and an economy that isn’t yet  what it could be.
Total U.S. carloads rose 3.8% in October 2021 over October 2020 as year-over-year gains in coal,  chemicals, and crushed stone and sand, among others, exceeded declines in motor vehicles, grain, and  petroleum products. October was the eighth straight month in which total carloads were higher than  the same month in 2020, but the 3.8% gain in October was the lowest gain in those eight months. ...
Supply chain problems (especially shortages of dray trucks, drivers, and warehouse space) kept  U.S. intermodal volume down in October — it fell 7.9% from October 2020, its third straight year-over-year decline.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
Total U.S. carload traffic has risen slightly but  perceptibly over the past two months. At the end of  October, the 6-week moving average for total carloads originated was 237,999. That’s the most since mid-June. ... Total carloads in  October 2021 were down 3.1% from October 2019. In  each month so far in 2021, total carloads in 2021 have  been below the comparable month in 2019.
The second graph shows the six week average (not monthly) of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
[I]ntermodal volumes continue to be driven down by supply chain problems — especially  shortages of dray trucks, drivers, and warehouse space — that are preventing rail customers from clearing their freight from rail terminals as quickly as they and railroads would like. Intermodal in October  2021 was down 7.9% from October 2020, its third straight year-over-year decline. October 202o was at  the time the best intermodal month ever.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
This is the first look at local markets in October.  I’m tracking about 30 local housing markets in the US. Some of the 30 markets are states, and some are metropolitan areas. I’ll update these tables throughout the month as additional data is released.
My view is that if the housing market is slowing, it will show up in inventory (not yet!).
...
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these three markets were down 24% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is larger than in September. This isn’t indicating a slowing market (but this is just 3 early reporting markets).

From CoStar: STR: Tampa Leads Top 25 US Markets in Weekly Performance
As anticipated ahead of Halloween, U.S. hotel performance fell week over week, according to STR‘s latest data through 30 October.
Oct. 24-30, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 58.9% (-5.7%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$127.70 (+1.5%)
• evenue per available room (RevPAR): US$75.28 (-4.3%)
Even with a drop in performance levels from previous weeks, comparisons with the matching week in 2019 improved because Halloween that year fell on a Thursday and created a more significant disruption in business travel and groups.
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use data from a large web-based job platform to study how the price of remote work is determined in a globalized labor market. In the platform, workers from around the world compete for jobs that can be done remotely. We document that, despite the global nature of the marketplace, the location of the worker accounts for over a third of the variance in wages. The observed wage differences are strongly correlated to the GDP per-capita of the worker’s country. This correlation is not accounted for by differences in workers’ characteristics, occupations, nor for differences in the employers’ locations. We also document that remote wages in local currency move almost one-for-one with the dollar exchange rate of the worker’s country, and are highly sensitive to changes in the wages of foreign competitors. Finally, we provide a new measure on which jobs are easier to offshore that is based on the prevalence of cross-border contracts rather than on subjective job characteristics, and show that there is substantial heterogeneity in the offshorability of remote occupations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent supply disruptions catapulted the issue of risk in global supply chains (GSCs) to the top of policy agendas and created the impression that shortages would have been less severe if GSCs were either shorter and more domestic, or more diversified. But is this right? We start our answer by reviewing studies that look at risks to and from GSCs, and how GSCs have recovered from past shocks. We then look at whether GSCs are too risky—starting with business research on how firms approach the cost-resiliency trade-off. We propose the risk-versus-reward framework from portfolio theory as a good way to evaluate whether anti-risk policy is justified. We then discuss how exposures to foreign shocks are measured and argue that exposure is higher than direct indicators imply. Finally, we consider the future of GSCs in the light of current policy proposals and advancing technology before pointing to the rich menu of topics for future research on the risk-GSC nexus.]]></summary>

We find that youth ITB prohibitions reduced population search intensity for tanning-related information. Among white teen girls, ITB prohibitions reduced self-reported indoor tanning and increased sun protective behaviors. We also find that youth ITB prohibitions significantly reduced the size of the indoor tanning market by increasing tanning salon closures and reducing tanning salon sales.]]></summary>

We exploit rules which state that Dutch general practitioners (GPs) must be available to make house calls to their patients.  In practice many therefore use postal code boundaries to limit their practices. We instrument a  postpartum woman’s receipt of antidepressants with the propensity to prescribe antidepressants to women aged 46 to 65 among GPs in her postal code. Ordinary Least Squares estimates suggest highly negative effects of postpartum treatment with antidepressants, but this is mainly due to selection into treatment. Instrumental variable estimates suggest that the marginal patient treated with postpartum antidepressants is much more likely to continue taking antidepressants long-term, with little evidence of effects on other outcomes.]]></summary>

We document striking imbalances. While Western and Northern European authors have made substantial gains, the representation of authors based in low-income countries remains extremely low -- an order of magnitude lower than the weight of their countries or regions in the global economy. Developing country representation has risen fastest at journals rated 100th or lower, while it has barely increased in journals rated 25th or higher. Fields such as international or development where global diversification may have been expected have not experienced much increase in developing country authorship. These results are consistent with a general increase in the relative supply of research in the rest of the world. But they also indicate authors from developing countries remain excluded from the profession’s top-rated journals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a deterministic overlapping-generations economy with production and physical capital, the price of debt can be positive without any budget surpluses being in the offing, because debt incorporates a rational bubble. Yet the dynamics of debt remain a function of the dynamics of the primary budget deficit. As a way to study their joint behavior, we endogenize a structural deficit in the form of an underfunded social-security scheme. We define debt capacity as the level of debt that can be just sustained without a change of policy all the way to an unstable steady state. When it starts below the capacity, the debt converges to a stable steady state, in which the bubble is sustained. Above capacity the bubble unravels and the deficit cannot be financed. In several realistic scenarios occurring in economies, we calculate the needed policy response, which is the true "fiscal cost" of exceeding debt capacity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The impact of an economic shock depends both on its severity and the resilience of the economic response. Resilience can include the ability to relocate factors, for example, even when new technologies or skills are not yet at the ready. This resilience per se buffers production and has an economic value, which we estimate. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a widespread decline in recorded GDP. Yet, as catastrophic as the collapse was, it was buffered by an unprecedented and spontaneous deployment of what we call “Potential Capital,” the dwelling/residential capital and connective technologies used alongside working from home. Together potential capital and labor working from home provided additional output margins and capacity. We estimate the contribution of this capital, and the remote work that it facilitated, to have roughly halved the decline in GDP in the US reducing the fall in GDP to 9.4 log points in 2020Q2 at the trough of the recession. Similar effects are seen in the 6 OECD countries for which data are available, output fell by 14 log points, but would have fallen by 26 log points had only workplace inputs been available. Accounting for the contribution of “Potential Capital” also revises downwards estimated total productivity gains in the business sector during the pandemic from 8 log points to 5 log points in 2020Q2. We also find an output elasticity of domestic non-dwellings capital to be similar to that of workplace ICT capital, reflecting its role as productive capital. Turning to the future, changes in working from home depend upon relative costs, relative technologies and, crucially, the elasticity of substitution between home and work tasks. We estimate that that elasticity to be more than unity, meaning that the growth of ICT will raise the share of work done remotely.]]></summary>

Although we confirm prior reports of an increase in domestic calls for service at the start of the pandemic, we find that the increase preceded mandatory shutdowns, and there was an incremental decline following the government imposition of restrictions. We find no evidence that domestic violence crimes increased. Rather, domestic violence assaults declined significantly during the initial shutdown period and there was no significant change in intimate partner homicides in these months. Our results fail to support claims that shutdowns increased domestic violence and suggest caution before drawing inference or basing policy on calls data alone.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study recent minimum wages by Amazon, Walmart, Target, CVS, and Costco using data from millions of online job ads and employee surveys. We document that these policies induced wage increases at low-wage jobs at other employers, where the modal response was to match the wage announced by the large retailer. In the case of Amazon’s $15 minimum wage in October 2018, our estimates imply that a 10% increase in Amazon’s advertised hourly wages led to an average increase of 2.3% among other employers in the same commuting zone. Using the CPS, we estimate wage increases in exposed jobs in line with our magnitudes from employee surveys and find that large employer minimum wage policies led to small but precisely estimated declines in employment, with employment elasticities ranging from -0.04 to -0.13. Large employer minimum wage announcements influenced wages more broadly. The magnitude of these wage spillovers cannot easily be explained by standard competitive pressures, suggesting a role for both market power and norms in wage determination.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Americans work longer in response to a changing retirement landscape, it is important to ask whether there are groups being left out of this trend. Geography is a natural lens through which to examine this question, given regional disparities in the employment of prime-age individuals. In this study, we explore the geography of retirement using data from the U.S. Census/American Community Survey and other sources. We find large differences across U.S. commuting zones in employment rates at older ages, with a gap of about 20 percentage points between areas at the 90th and 10th percentiles of employment. Low-employment areas are systematically different, with a less educated and more diverse population, more low-wage jobs and import competition from China, poorer health outcomes and health care access, lower government spending, and more income inequality. Although these correlations are not necessarily causal, these factors collectively can explain about four-fifths of the geographic variation in employment at older ages.]]></summary>

Our results indicate that French restaurant prices increased faster than Grade 7 salaries over the entire period and changes in the British exchange rate were not favorable for British travelers.  To dine weekly in France, during the 1950s and 1960s, Bond would have spent 18 percent of his salary; whereas over the course of the Euro era the same basket of luxury services would have required on average 26 percent of his salary.  Finally, our data indicate a likely violation of the law of one price during both the Pound-Franc and Pound-Euro eras.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper explores the economic incentives for medical procedure innovation. Using a proprietary dataset on billing code applications for emerging medical procedures, we highlight two mechanisms that could hinder innovation. First, the administrative hurdle of securing permanent, reimbursable billing codes substantially delays innovation diffusion. We find that Medicare utilization of innovative procedures increases nearly nine-fold after the billing codes are promoted to permanent (reimbursable) from provisional (non-reimbursable). However, only 29 percent of the provisional codes are promoted within the five-year probation period. Second, medical procedures lack intellectual property rights, especially those without patented devices. When appropriability is limited, specialty medical societies lead the applications for billing codes. We indicate that the ad hoc process for securing billing codes for procedure innovations creates uncertainty about both the development process and the allocation and enforceability of property rights. This stands in stark contrast to the more deliberate regulatory oversight for pharmaceutical innovations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two-stage least squares estimates in heavily over-identified instrumental variables (IV) models can be misleadingly close to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates when many instruments are weak. Just-identified (just-ID) IV estimates using a single instrument are also biased, but the importance of weak-instrument bias in just-ID IV applications remains contentious. We argue that in microeconometric applications, just-ID IV estimators can typically be treated as all but unbiased and that the usual inference strategies are likely to be adequate. The argument begins with contour plots for confidence interval coverage as a function of instrument strength and explanatory variable endogeneity. These show undercoverage in excess of 5% only for endogeneity beyond that seen even when IV and OLS estimates differ by an order of magnitude. Three widely cited microeconometric applications are used to explain why endogeneity is likely low enough for IV estimates to be reliable. We then show that an estimator that’s unbiased given a population first-stage sign restriction has bias exceeding that of IV when the restriction is imposed on the data. But screening on the sign of the estimated first stage is shown to halve the median bias of conventional IV without reducing coverage. To the extent that sign-screening is already part of empirical workflows, reported IV estimates enjoy the minimal bias of sign-screened just-ID IV.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Population growth has declined markedly in almost all major economies since the 1970s. We argue this trend has important consequences for the process of firm dynamics and aggregate growth. We study a rich semi-endogenous growth model of firm dynamics, and show analytically that a decline in population growth reduces creative destruction, increases average firm size and concentration, raises market power and misallocation, and lowers aggregate growth in the long-run. We also show lower population growth has positive effects on the level of productivity, making the short-run welfare impacts ambiguous. In a quantitative application to the U.S, we find that the slowdown in population growth since the 1980s and the projected continuation of this trend accounts for a substantial share of the fall in the entry and exit rates and the increase in firm size. By contrast, the impact on markups is modest. The effect on aggregate growth is positive for around two decades, before turning negative thereafter.]]></summary>

Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, we find that developers file for more multi-family construction permits in blocks with higher allowable densities. We incorporate these micro-estimates into an equilibrium model of housing supply and demand to estimate the long term impact of zoning changes. Supply responses from the reform produce a 2.2 percent increase in the total housing stock, leading to a 0.5% reduction in prices on average, with substantial heterogeneity across neighborhoods. Consumer welfare gains due to price reductions are small, but increase 4-fold once we account for changes in the built environment, with more gains accruing to college-educated and higher income households. However, nominal house price losses faced by existing homeowners and landlords overshadow all consumer welfare gains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many economic environments in which an object is offered sequentially to prospective buyers. It is often observed that once the object for sale is turned down by one or more agents, those that follow do the same. One explanation that has been proposed for this phenomenon is that agents making choices further down the line rationally ignore their own assessment of the object's quality and herd behind their predecessors. Our research adds a new dimension to the canonical herding model by allowing agents to differ in their ability to assess the quality of the offered object. We develop novel tests of herding based on this ability heterogeneity and also examine its efficiency consequences, applied to organ transplantation in the U.K. We find that herding is common but that the information lost due to herding does not substantially increase false discards of good organs or false acceptances of bad organs. Our counter-factual analysis indicates that this is due (in part) to the high degree of heterogeneity in ability across transplant centers. In other settings, such as the U.S., where organ transplantation is organized very differently and the ability distribution will not be the same, the inefficiencies due to herding might well be substantial.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do children affect women in science? We investigate this question using rich biographical data, linked with patents and publications, for 83,000 American scientists in 1956 at the height of the baby boom. Our analyses reveal a unique life-cycle pattern of productivity for mothers. While other scientists peak in their mid-thirties, mothers become more productive after age 35 and maintain high productivity in their 40s and 50s. Event studies show that the output of mothers increases after 15 years of marriage, while other scientists peak in the first 10 years. Differences in the timing of productivity have important implications for tenure and participation. Just 27% of mothers who are academic scientists get tenure, compared with 48% of fathers and 46% of women without children. Mothers face comparable tenure rates to other assistant professors for the first six years but fall behind afterwards, suggesting that they face higher standards of early productivity. Mothers who survive in science are extremely positively selected: Compared with other married women, mothers patent (publish) 2.5 (1.4) times more before the median age at marriage. Compared with men, female scientists are more educated, half as likely to marry, one-third as likely to have children, but half as likely to survive in science. Employment records indicate that a generation of baby boom mothers was lost to science.]]></summary>

Our goal is to derive mathematical formulas for child support amounts that achieve those normative goals while satisfying basic desiderata such as supporting children in both of their families, equity between siblings, neutral medical decisions, and not requiring higher contributions from parents with a lower salary.]]></summary>

We then offer an overarching statistical framework of algorithmic discrimination through the lens of measurement errors, which is familiar to the health economics audience. Specifically, we show that algorithmic discrimination exists when measurement errors exist in either the outcome or the predictors, and there is endogenous selection for participation in the observed data. The absence of any of these phenomena would eliminate algorithmic discrimination. We show that although equalized odds constraints can be employed as bias-mitigating strategies, such constraints may increase algorithmic discrimination when there is measurement error in the dependent variable.]]></summary>

Causally estimating the marginal value of biomedical research is challenging due to a lack of micro data linking health outcomes to plausibly exogenous variation in research. We create a new linkage between a research database (PubMed) and administrative death records that enables research to be related to mortality at the geographic, disease and time level. We then estimate the marginal impact of biomedical research on mortality using hospital market (HRR) level shocks to research activity by disease. Our identification strategy builds on the literature on the dissemination of knowledge, specifically that of local knowledge spillovers. By utilizing variation across diseases, time and distance from research we control for additional trends relative to the current literature. Our results show that an additional research publication on average reduces local mortality from a disease by 0.35%. Our results also provide novel evidence that there are health benefits to the local communities (local spillovers) in which biomedical research is conducted.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Focusing on bipolar disorder (BD), we investigate the link between mental health, creativity, and wealth. Analyzing population data for Denmark, we find that people with BD are more likely to be musicians, but less likely to hold other creative jobs than the population. Healthy siblings of people with BD, however, are consistently more likely to work in creative jobs. We also show people in the top decile of parental wealth are seven times as likely to work in creative professions compared with the bottom decile. Yet, wealth differences only explain a small portion of the link between BD and creativity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we review the growing literature on FinTech lending – the provision of credit facilitated by technology that improves the customer-lender interaction or lenders’ screening and monitoring of borrowers. FinTech lending has grown rapidly, though in developed economies like the U.S. it still only accounts for a small share of total credit. An increase in convenience and speed appears to have been more central to FinTech lending’s growth than improved screening or monitoring, though there is certainly potential for the latter, as is the case for increased financial inclusion. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown potential vulnerabilities of FinTech lenders, although in certain segments they have displayed rapid growth.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper considers fiscal policy during the pandemic through the lens of optimal social insurance. We develop a simple framework to analyze how government taxes and transfers could mimic the insurance against pandemic income losses that people would like to have had. Permutations of the framework provide insight into how unemployment insurance should be structured, when and how much hazard pay is called for, and whether fiscal policy should aim just to redistribute income or also to stimulate aggregate demand during a pandemic. When we use the insights from the model to evaluate unemployment insurance measures taken during the pandemic, we find that some, but far from all, of the implications of the social insurance framework were followed. In the case of hazard pay, we find that the proposal for a national program (the never-implemented HEROES Act) was both broader and more generous than a social insurance perspective would call for. We suggest that the social insurance perspective on fiscal policy is likely to become increasingly relevant as pandemics and climate-related natural disasters become more common causes of unemployment and recessions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Great Depression struck the United States, Oliver M.W. Sprague was America’s foremost expert on financial crises. His History of Crises under the National Banking System is a frequently cited classic. Had he diagnosed a banking panic and called for an aggressive response by the Federal Reserve, it might have made a difference; but he did not. Sprague’s misdiagnosis had, I argue, two causes. First, the crisis lacked the symptoms of a panic, such as high short-term interest rates in the New York money market, which Sprague had identified from his studies of previous crises. Second, Sprague’s macro-economic ideas led him to conclude that an expansionary monetary policy would be of little help once a depression was underway. Sprague’s main concern was that abandoning the gold standard would intensify the crisis, a concern that led him to resign his position as advisor to the U.S. Treasury to protest Roosevelt’s gold policy.]]></summary>

In 2011, EU member states were invited to strengthen their medium-term fiscal planning, but EU surveillance is still very much centred on the year ahead. This column argues that multiannual expenditure paths would be a promising way to improve the medium-term orientation of fiscal policy and, by extension, fiscal performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BEA released their estimate of light vehicle sales for October today.  The BEA estimates sales of 12.99 million SAAR in October 2021 (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate), up 6.3% from the September sales rate, and down 20.8% from October 2020. 

This was well above the consensus estimate of 12.4 million SAAR.
Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows light vehicle sales since 1967 from the BEA.  The dashed line is sales for the current month.
The impact of COVID-19 was significant, and April 2020 was the worst month.
After April 2020, sales increased, and were close to sales in 2019 (the year before the pandemic).  


However, sales decreased earlier this year due to supply issues. It appears the "supply chain bottom" was in September.


So far - through October - sales are up 9.2% in 2021 compared to 2020.
This second graph shows the percent of light vehicle sales between passenger cars and trucks / SUVs through October 2021.
Over time the mix has changed more and more towards light trucks and SUVs.
Only when oil prices are high, does the trend slow or reverse.
The percent of light trucks and SUVs was at 80.1% in October 2021 - an all time high.
The third graph shows heavy truck sales since 1967 using data from the BEA. The dashed line is the October 2021 seasonally adjusted annual sales rate (SAAR).
Heavy truck sales really collapsed during the great recession, falling to a low of 180 thousand SAAR in May 2009.  Then heavy truck sales increased to a new all time high of 563 thousand SAAR in September 2019.
Note: "Heavy trucks - trucks more than 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight."
Heavy truck sales really declined at the beginning of the pandemic, falling to a low of 299 thousand SAAR in May 2020.  

Heavy truck sales were at 445 thousand SAAR in October, up from 404 thousand SAAR in September, but down 1% from 450 thousand SAAR in October 2020.]]></summary>

But the bottom line is inventories are very low, mortgage rates are still historically low, and demographics are currently favorable for home buying.
If the housing market slows - for whatever reason - I think the slowdown will show up in active existing home inventory. This is why I track local market inventory so closely every month. Some markets have seen inventories increase, but overall active inventory was at a record low for September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Posted with permission).  The October ISM® Services index was at 66.79%, up from 61.9% last month. The employment index decreased to 51.6%, from 53.0%.  Note: Above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction. 
From the Institute for Supply Management: Services PMI® at 66.7%  October 2021 Services ISM® Report On Business® 
Economic activity in the services sector grew in October for the 17th month in a row — with the rate of expansion setting a record for the fourth time in 2021 — say the nation's purchasing and supply executives in the latest Services ISM® Report On Business®.
The report was issued today by Anthony Nieves, CPSM, C.P.M., A.P.P., CFPM, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management® (ISM®) Services Business Survey Committee: “In October, the Services PMI® registered another all-time high of 66.7 percent, 4.8 percentage points above September’s reading of 61.9 percent. This figure exceeds the former all-time high of 64.1 percent in July; previous records were set in May (64 percent) and March (63.7 percent). The data quickly explains the elevated Services PMI® reading, as two of the four equally weighted subindexes that directly factor into the composite index set all-time highs: The Business Activity Index reached 69.8 percent, an increase of 7.5 percentage points compared to the reading of 62.3 percent in September, and the New Orders Index hit 69.7 percent, up 6.2 percentage points from last month’s figure of 63.5 percent. (The other two subindexes are Employment and Supplier Deliveries, both also in expansion territory in October.)
   emphasis added
This was above the consensus forecast,  however the employment index decreased to 51.6%, from 53.0% the previous month.]]></summary>

“The labor market showed renewed momentum last month, with a jump from the third quarter average of  385,000 monthly jobs added, marking nearly 5 million job gains this year,” said Nela Richardson, chief  economist, ADP. “Service sector providers led the increase and the goods sector gains were broad  based, reporting the strongest reading of the year. Large companies fueled the stronger recovery in  October, marking the second straight month of impressive growth.”
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said, “The job market is revving back up as the Delta wave of the pandemic winds down. Job gains are accelerating across all industries, and especially among  large companies. As long as the pandemic remains contained, more big job gains are likely in coming months.”

  This was well above the consensus forecast of 400,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 413 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in October.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.]]></summary>

어떻게 하면 이 시대 청년들에게 꿈과 희망을 줄 수 있을까? 이 시대적 과제에 대한 해결책을 모색하고자 뜻을 같이하는 교수 6명이 이 책을 집필하게 되었다. 더 이상 강단에서 지켜보지만 말고 시대에 역행하는 모순을 바로잡아야만 한다는 사명감에서 출발하였다. 

흔히 우리는 기술혁신이 일자리를 빼앗고 소득 양극화를 심화시킬 수 있다고 오해하기 쉽다. 그러나 이는 편견에 지나지 않으며, 불평등 사회를 조장하는 것은 기술혁신이 아니라 그 혁신을 가로막는 제도다. 그 제도 때문에 일자리가 줄어드는 것이다.

제1장 노동시장의 이중구조와 노동조합의 사회적 책임

복지와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：스웨덴
기술혁신과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：독일
고용과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：프랑스와 남부 유럽

4. 디지털 시대의 노동, 무엇을 어떻게 할 것인가
디지털 시대의 노동시장과 노동조합
손 놓고 있는 한국
노동개혁의 방향
일자리문제의 시각부터 바로잡자
중소기업을 고임금 일자리로 만들자

후진적인 임금고용관행을 바꾸자
노동조합은 사회적 책임 강화에 나서라
노동법을 바꾸자
정치적 결단이 요구된다

제2장 최저임금제도의 역설：2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 부작용

It may now be tempting to rely on the post-pandemic growth and inflation rebound to reduce debt burdens.

As a result, some developing economies may eventually need to resort to debt default to restore fiscal sustainability, with the associated heavy economic and political cost. The global community can help by coordinating prompt and efficient debt relief and restructuring.]]></summary>

From CoreLogic: US Annual Home Price Growth Hits 18% in September as Supply and Demand Imbalances Intensify, CoreLogic Reports
CoreLogic® ... released the CoreLogic Home Price Index (HPI™) and HPI Forecast™ for September 2021.
Demand for homebuying remained strong through the end of the summer. However, the ongoing housing supply shortage has continued to drive up prices, which increased 18% year over year in September, to record highs creating additional challenges for entry into the homebuying market. High demand and low supply levels for entry-level homes, in particular, are sidelining many would-be first-time buyers.
As millennials continue to make up a large part of homebuying demand and flock to tech hubs like Seattle; San Jose, California and Austin, Texas, we may see this challenge intensify. This is reflected in a recent CoreLogic consumer survey, with 47.9% of this cohort stating they cannot afford to purchase a home in their preferred area.
“The pandemic led prospective buyers to seek detached homes in communities with lower population density, such as suburbs and exurbs,” said Frank Martell, president and CEO of CoreLogic. “As we head into 2022, we expect some moderation in the current pattern of flight away from urban cores as the pandemic wanes.”
...
 Nationally, home prices increased 18% in September 2021, compared to September 2020. On a month-over-month basis, home prices increased by 1.1% compared to August 2021.
...
 In September, appreciation of detached properties (19.6%) was 7.4 percentage points higher than that of attached properties (12.2%).

Mortgage rates moved moderately lower today despite an absence of significant movement in the bond market.  In general, when bonds improve, rates fall (and vice versa), but it's not feasible for mortgage lenders to adjust their rates offerings in relative real-time as bonds can send massively mixed signals on any given day.

시장이 클수록 혁신에 대한 보상은 증가하며, 이는 더 많은 혁신을 불러온다. 그러나 전 세계 인구의 0.7%에도 미치지 못하지만 세계 10위의 경제 규모를 가지게 된 우리나라는 무역을 통해서 혁신을 자극하는 효과를 누려왔다. 박지형 교수는 한국의 사례를 들어 국내의 인적·물적 자원뿐 아니라 전 세계 자원을 효과적으로 활용해야 지속적 혁신을 할 수 있다고 강조한다.

2021년 글로벌혁신지수(Global Innovation Index)에서 한국은 스위스, 스웨덴, 미국, 영국에 이어 세계 5위의 혁신국가로 평가됐다. 하지만 한국은 ‘기술 융합 역량’은 우수한 편이나 ‘창의적 사고’와 ‘공정하고 유연한 제도’의 면에서는 다른 선진국에 비해 뒤처진다. 이정민 교수는 정부가 충분한 숙려 기간과 사전 검토 기간을 거친 후 정책을 체계적으로 결정해야 엉뚱한 곳으로 투자 자원이 소모되지 않는다고 지적한다.

This column evaluates the effects of carbon taxes by employing utility-based measures of whether a household is better off. The transparency of such a policy increases political support if a substantial majority of the population benefit from the carbon tax plus cash disbursal. However, endogenous behaviour blunts the effectiveness of such transfers; for Germany, it diminishes political approval from 60% to 30%. Using revenue for lowering income taxes as well for dividends increases popular support back to above 50%.]]></summary>

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of October 29th, inventory was at 414 thousand (7 day average), compared to 543 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.9%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55.0% from 919 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 423 thousand, and was down 23.1% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 35% above the record low in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September.   Eight weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 5.4% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for October.]]></summary>

Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,229.9 billion, 0.5 percent below the revised August estimate of $1,236.1 billion. ...
In September, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $343.7 billion, 0.7 percent below the revised August estimate of $345.9 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 14% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 10% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been weak recently.
Public construction spending is 6% above the peak in March 2009, but weak recently.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 19.3%.  Non-residential spending is down 0.5% year-over-year.  Public spending is down 2.4% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service during the early months of the pandemic in most areas, and did not decline sharply like many other sectors.  However, some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 32.8% YoY, and office down 2.9% YoY.

This was below consensus expectations of a 0.4% increase in spending, and construction spending for the previous two months was revised down.]]></summary>

This column provides descriptive evidence on the backlash, discusses its theoretical underpinnings within standard trade models, and reviews the evidence on its drivers. It appears that globalisation is at stake partly due to reasons that are not strictly related to trade. The political sustainability of globalisation – and arguably of the international liberal order – will depend on how successful societies are at managing in a more inclusive way the distributional consequences of structural change.]]></summary>

In a video recorded at 2020's AEA conference, Sascha Becker (Warwick University & CEPR) explains how data around the changes to Polish borders following WWII confirms a hypothesis that people who have suddenly lost everything through forced migration place a higher value on education for them and their children, once relocated. The policy implications are clear: governments should ensure that migrants who arrive following forced relocation are given quick and effective access to education for their children as this will benefit both them and their host country.]]></summary>

Using the ECB-Global model, this column estimates the impact on inflation of the fiscal stimulus to be limited. Three scenarios are undertaken to quantify the upside risks to inflation which could arise from considering a steeper Phillips curve, stronger fiscal multipliers, and rising inflation expectations. The results suggest that the impact on inflation from these sources of risk is likely to be moderate, unless all of the risks materialise simultaneously, and the Fed does not depart from the assumed monetary policy path.]]></summary>

돈이 무엇인지 설명한다. 세계사의 여러 장면을 조명해 돈이 어떻게 만들어지고, 어떻게 발전해왔는지 알아본다. 지배자들은 돈에 개입해 주화라는 개념을 만들면서 시뇨리지를 챙기고, 지배자들의 더 큰 개입은 훗날 은행으로 발전한다. 

천재 과학자 뉴턴은 영국의 금본위제를 도입하고 이는 산업혁명과 함께 유럽 전체가 금본위제를 도입하게 되는 시발점이 된다. 사실 영국의 금본위제는 우연과 실수의 산물이며 이는 중국과 유럽 사이의 무역 불균형에서 초래한 바가 크다.

한편, 두 번의 세계 대전을 거쳐 미국의 달러는 소위 기축통화의 위치를 얻게 되는데 소위 브레튼 우즈 협약을 통해 미국 달러는 종이로 만든 금의 위치에 오르게 된다. 훗날 IMF는 SDR이라는 형태로 케인스가 주창했던 방코르를 흉내 내고 이는 현재까지도 세계 무역의 기본이 되는 통화다. 

이 밖에도 미국과 일본의 양적완화와 테이퍼링, 인플레이션과 초인플레이션, 현대 통화 이론 등을 살펴보며 미국 정책금리와 통화량의 변화도 알아본다. 전 세계를 뜨겁게 달군 비트코인도 조명한다. 비트코인은 화폐인지, 비트코인은 투자인지 투기인지, FATF와 가상자산은 무엇인지, 암호화폐와 토큰, NFT, DeFi, CBDC, DAO 비트코인과 엘살바도르의 위험한 실험, 디지털 자산의 실체도 자세히 살펴본다.

경제라는 복잡한 세계의 입구에서 갈팡질팡하는 분들을 위해 쓰인 책이다. 비즈니스는 물론이고 정치와 행정 등 모든 사회적 현상의 기초에는 경제 문제가 관련되어 있다. 하지만 일반적인 경제학 입문서나 교과서에는 추상적인 개념만 가득할 뿐, 우리의 실생활과 어떤 관련이 있는지는 찾아보기 어렵다. 

이 책은 ‘가격’이라는, 경제에서 가장 기초가 되는 키워드를 바탕으로 쓰인 책이다. 가격이 상품과 함께 태어나서 자라나는 험난한 여정을 따라가며, 가격이 수행하는 사회적 역할의 크기를 살펴보고 어떤 사람들이 어떻게 가격을 만들고 키워내는지, 그 과정을 거슬러 올라가며 확인할 것이다. 또 사회 속에 존재하는, 가격을 중심으로 한 전반적인 경제 시스템을 탐구해 나갈 것이다.

가격은 ‘우리의 생활’ 그 자체다. 이 책의 의도는 가격 결정 과정에서부터 시작된 경제가 사회에서 실제로 어떻게 작용하는지, 그 생생한 시스템을 보여 주는 것이다. 약속하건대 이 책을 읽는 사람은 누구든 경제가 무엇인지 명확하게 실감할 수 있게 될 것이다.

들어가며 - 옛날에는 주먹밥에 가격이 없었다?
프롤로그 - 가격을 통해 보는 사회 시스템

제1장 우리는 가격에 의지해 구매할 수밖에 없는가?
물건을 산다는 것은 무엇일까? 
사실 구매자는 상품에 대해 잘 모른다 
왜 내가 올 것이라는 것을 미리 알고 있을까? 
우리의 눈은 ‘이안 반사식 카메라’ 
가격은 경제의 ‘키 플레이어’

제2장 경제의 이모저모는 가격이 조정한다
전제: 시장경제란 무엇일까 
매매에서는 ‘가격’과 ‘수량’이 문제 
‘가격 메커니즘’ - 가격이 움직이면 수량도 움직인다 
경매에서는 ‘가격 메커니즘’이 작동한다 
가격 메커니즘은 그래프로 나타낼 수 있다 

제3장 투입한 생산비용을 회수할 수 있을까?
상품을 생산한다는 것은 무엇일까? 
상품이 팔리지 않는 것이 가장 큰 문제 
이익을 키우는 방법 
리스크가 적은 행동을 선택한다 
드디어 출하! 
가격은 생산자의 생명줄

제4장 가격은 어떻게 결정되는가?
현실의 시장은 어떤 시스템인가? 
시장에는 상품도 기업도 모여든다 
도매상을 중심으로 사고팔다 
경매 거래로 공정한 가격을 만든다 
시장이라는 시스템을 
경제학적으로 생각해 보자 
경매의 구조 
수요와 공급은 어떻게 가격을 결정할까

제5장 전부 팔아 치우기 위한 전략적 가격 결정
소매상에 있어 가격이란 무엇일까? 
상점에서는 가격을 어떻게 결정할까? 
소비자는 어떻게 판단할까? 
소비자의 ‘실속있는 소비’, 그 적정 가격은? 
타점포와의 가격 경쟁도 있다 
‘가격을 파는’ 전략을 취한다 
이렇게 해서 가격이 결정된다

제6장 최후의 관문, 소비자의 ‘까다로운 눈’
적절한 가격을 순간적으로 판단하는 기준은? 
쇼핑의 심리와 행동의 흐름 
우리는 매번 합리적으로 판단하지는 않는다 
판매자가 교묘히 이용하는 쇼핑 심리 
우리도 경험을 쌓아 직감을 기르자

덧붙이는 장 눈에 보이지 않는 가격도 있다
칼럼① 무료여도 괜찮을까? 
칼럼② 보이지 않는 가격에는 어떤 의미가 있을까? 
칼럼③ 가격의 끝자리를 주목하자 
칼럼④ ...

대학에서 지난 수년간 “소프트웨어 프로그래밍(파이썬)” 과목을 강의하면서 다양한 교과서를 살펴보았다. 어떤 서적은 한 학기에 파이썬 교육을 완성하기에 분량이 너무 많았고 시간이 부족해서 적절한 교과서를 찾기 쉽지 않았다. 연세대 강의는 전교의 다양한 학생들이 수강하고 있으며 거의 대부분의 수강생들이 프로그래밍 배경이 전혀 없는 상태이다. 실제 강의는 매주 강의 2시간 및 실습(LAB) 2시간으로 진행해 왔다. 이러한 요구와 여건에 맞추어 이 책을 저술하게 되었다. 

이 책은 실제 강의 내용에 기반하여 LAB 내용(연습문제의 B. 따라하기 실습 및 C. 프로그래밍 실습)을 구성하였다. 수강생들은 LAB 내용(B. 따라하기 실습)을 그대로 따라함으로써 파이썬 언어를 익히고, 간단한 프로그래밍 문제(C. 프로그래밍 실습)를 LAB 시간 내에 완성하는 방식을 따랐다. 이 책을 사용하는 모든 사람이 이와 동일한 방법으로 비교적 단시간 내에 파이썬 언어의 모든 것을 배우고 활용 능력을 발휘해 나갈 수 있을 것이다.

사람들은 비어 있는 집(공간)을 공유하거나 주차장에 세워져 있는 차로 운송 및 배송을 하며 부수입을 얻을 수 있다. 나만이 알고 있던 지식이나 창작물을 콘텐츠화해 확산시키며 구독자를 늘릴 수 있다. 카카오톡으로 메시지를 공유하거나 네이버와 구글에서 지식 검색을 하고 답변을 올리면서 데이터 생산에 참여한다. 이 데이터들은 빅테크 기업의 자산이 된다.

이처럼 플랫폼은 우리의 일상을 조금씩 바꾸고 있다. 새로 등장한 경제 방식을 제대로 활용하기 위해서는 플랫폼에 대한 정의부터 예시까지 정확한 이해가 필수다. ‘10대가 꼭 읽어야 할 사회・과학 교양 시리즈’의 열 번째 주제인 ‘플랫폼 경제’는, 동시대를 살아가는 우리 청소년들이 경험하게 될 경제사회를 이해하는 데 꼭 필요한 개념을 소개하며 미래를 준비하게 도와준다.

익숙하지 않을 뿐, 부족한 게 아니에요’라는 슬로건 아래, 이제 막 사회에 발을 들여 모든 것이 낯설고 두려운 뽀시래기 직장인들을 위한 뉴스레터를 만들고 있는 <뽀시래기의 지식 한 장> 팀이 신입사원이나 IT 용어가 낯선 이들이 현장에서 바로 써먹을 수 있는 실무 용어들을 모아 한 권의 책으로 엮은 것이다. 

이 책에서는 총 175개의 용어를 7개의 분야로 나눠 설명하고 있는데, 우리의 뽀시래기 직장인들이 궁금해하는 용어가 실제 현장에서 어떻게 활용되는지 대화와 상황 설명을 통해 보여주고, 뽀식이 캐릭터를 활용한 일러스트와 더 알아두면 좋은 정보를 통해 해당 용어를 실무에서 완벽하게 이해 혹은 활용할 수 있도록 도와주고 있다.

많은 인문학자들이 입을 모아 현재를 ‘대변혁의 시대’라고 칭한다. 전 인류를 위협하는 질병과, 경제 위기 등으로 매일 아침 우리는 변화를 맞이하고 그에 발맞추어야 하는 시대를 살고 있다. 이런 격변의 시기에 우리는 어떻게 살아가야 하는가? 한국인이 맞닥뜨린 이 존재론적 고민에 대한 해결의 실마리를 제시하기 위해, 대한민국 대표 석학 12인이 한자리에 모였다. 기후 위기 등 환경 문제(최재천, 공우석, 제임스 후퍼), 삶과 죽음을 대하는 자세(유성호, 정상훈), 코로나 이후 자본의 흐름(홍익희, 유인경), 운과 운명(강헌, 박성준) 그리고 미래를 주도할 열쇠 메타버스(김상균, 강유정, 전범선)까지. 인생을 구성하는 핵심 키워드를 놓고, 방대한 지식을 바탕으로 더 나은 삶에 대한 예리한 인사이트를 풀어 놓는다. 『한국인을 읽는다』는 이 시대에 현대인이 필수로 갖춰야 할 지식과 통찰을 묶어 놓은 현대 지성의 산물이다. 삶이 갈피를 잡지 못해 부유한다고 느끼는가? 이 책의 지식과 통찰은 당신의 삶에 지혜라는 돛을 달아줄 것이다.

한국판 뉴딜정책에 대해 진단하고 그 성과를 기반으로 더 큰 보폭으로 디지털 혁신 시대를 준비하기 위해 출간된 도서이다. 여기에는 뉴노멀 트렌드를 고려한 전통산업의 디지털 전환, 디지털 산업의 신성장, 비대면 시대의 신산업 트렌드, 뉴노멀 시대 신인류와 교육혁신, 지역균형발전과 양극화 해소, 재난안전관리와 스마트 복지, 스마트 정부와 공공혁신 등의 주제에 대해 각 분야의 전문가와 학자들이 1년여 동안 연구한 내용이 담겨있다.

그간 추진해온 ‘한국판 뉴딜’의 성과를 딛고 디지털 혁신으로 이루는 미래 비전을 준비해 모든 국민이 더불어 행복한 명실상부한 혁신적 포용국가로 거듭나야 할 것이다. 조금만 더 체계적으로 노력한다면 ‘디지털 융합 경제’시대를 이끌 더 강한 대한민국이 될 r것이다.

1위 반도체 기업들의 경쟁력과 전략. 새로운 승자들의 도전 등 혁신과 전략의 과정을 기술 발전 사례와 데이터를 토대로 설명했던 《반도체 제국의 미래》에 최근의 혼란스러운 국내외 반도체 산업의 환경까지 모두 담아 2년 만에 개정증보판으로 새롭게 출간됐다.

기존의 알찬 구성에 진공관, 트랜지스터, 모스펫 등 진화를 거쳐 우리가 아는 반도체가 되기까지 흐름을 알 수 있도록 내용을 추가했고, 새 CEO를 영입하며 새로운 생태계 조성을 시도하는 인텔의 야심을 엿볼 수 있다. 기존 부록에서 반도체 공정에 관한 자세한 설명으로 독자의 이해를 도왔다면, 이번 개정증보판에는 향후 시장의 방향성까지 짐작할 수 있도록 했다. 

독자는 첫 번째, 팹리스 관점에서 파운드리 사업이 무엇인지 알아보고 급변하는 파운드리 시장에 관해 이해하며, 두 번째, 2021년 6월, 미국 백악관이 발표한 반도체 공급망 보고서 내용을 통해 한층 더 치열해진 각축전에서 기업이 어떤 노력을 기울일지 가늠할 수 있다.

반도체 산업의 발전과 변화 속도는 어떤 분야와도 비교할 수 없을 만큼 빠르다. 《반도체 제국의 미래》는 저자의 날카로운 시선으로 각 기업들이 구사한 전략의 구체적이고 생생한 사례, 데이터와 전문지 등을 기반으로 한 근거와 전망, 합리적인 미래 예측까지 선보였다. 이번 개정증보판에서는 기존의 핵심 내용에 업계 최신 동향을…]]></summary>

이미 강남 아파트 가격이 미국 맨해튼의 평당 가격을 넘어선 지 오래다. 자산은 버블 국면에 진입하면 그 자체의 관성으로 계속 오르는 경향이 있다. 언젠가 터질 것을 알지만 적어도 내 앞은 아닐 것이라는 낙관론, 정부가 무언가 할 것이라는 학습 효과가 지금과 같은 2030세대의 비이성적인 주택 추격 매수까지 양산하고 있다.

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.

영국의 경제사학자이자 『존 메이너드 케인스』 전기 3부작으로 세계적 명성을 얻은 원로 경제 석학 로버트 스키델스키 교수의 최신 화제작. 2008년 글로벌 금융 위기 예측 실패 이후 별다른 진보를 보이지 못한 ‘주류 경제학(신고전주의 경제학)’의 문제점을 총체적으로 진단하고 처방을 모색한다. 모두 13개 장을 할애해 ‘방법론적 결함’에서 ‘학문적 불완전성’까지 치밀하게 살핀다. 비판의 강도가 높고 범위도 넓다.

이 책에서 스키델스키 교수는 작심하고 주류 경제학을 공격하지만, 그 의도는 경제학을 향한 깊은 믿음과 기대에 있다. 그가 보기에 경제학이야말로 인류에게 ‘더 나은 삶’을 열어줄 수 있는 가장 강력하고 현실적인 학문이기 때문이다. 그는 경제학 본연의 역할을 되찾아주고자 이 책을 썼다.

세계 제일의 케인스 전문가라는 타이틀 탓에 ‘케인스주의’로의 회귀를 주장할 것 같지만 그렇지 않고, 주류 경제학을 공격한다고 해서 비주류 경제학을 옹호하는 것도 아니다. 저자는 ‘신고전주의’가 경제학의 주류가 된 배경을 명확히 인지하되, 그 속의 심각한 결함을 바로잡아야 ‘더 나은 삶을 위한 경제학’으로의 대전환을 이룰 수 있다고 역설한다.

서울대 비교경제연구센터와 경제추격연구소에서 매년 발행하는 《2022 한국경제 대전망》이 출간되었다. 서울대학교 경제학부 교수이자 국민경제자문회의 부의장인 이근 교수를 위시하여 총 26명의 경제전문가들이 분야별 산업별 국내외 이슈를 통해 우리나라 경제를 거시적으로 조망해보는 미래예측서이다.

올해 우리나라 경제는 여러 가지 중대한 진퇴양난 상황에 부딪쳤다. 대외적으로는 미국과 중국 사이에서 균형 있는 선택이 필요했다. 미·중 모두와 긴밀한 관계를 맺고 있는 한국은 미국에 섣불리 동조하기도, 여전히 성장하는 중국 시장을 무시하기도 어려웠다. 대내적으로는 코로나19 위기에 대응하기 위해 정부 재정 지출을 확충하면서 증가하는 국가부채를 고려해야 했다.

2022년 한국경제는 ‘합종연횡’이라는 키워드 아래 코로나19 경제위기에서의 탈출이라는 큰 흐름을 이어나갈 전망이다. 미·중의 통상 갈등 문제는 바이든 정부 출범 후 처음 열린 G7 정상회의에서 서방의 중국 견제가 공고화되면서 새 전기를 맞았다. 대중국 견제가 강화되면 미중 사이 디커플링이 심화되면서, 그동안 중국과의 강력한 경쟁 압력에 직면해왔던 한국 기업은 도약의 기회를 맞이할 수 있다.

2021년 노벨 경제학상은 ‘최저임금과 실업률’ 간의 기존 통념이 잘못됐음을 입증한 실증경제학자 데이비드 카드 교수에게 수여됐다. 돌아보면 1968년에 노벨 경제학상이 생겨난 후 수십 년 동안은 거의 수학 이론의 차지였다. 그러나 2008년을 기점으로 비수학적 모델에 경제학상을 수여하는 사례가 늘고 있다.

세상이 점점 더 복잡해지고 시장의 불확실성 또한 커지면서 기존의 경제학 이론으로는 설명할 수 없는 현상들이 등장하고 있기 때문이다. 하지만 여느 학문이 그러하듯이 행동경제학이나 진화경제학 등 새로운 경제학 이론 모델도 이전의 경제학자들이 만들어놓은 토대 위에서 발전해온 것이다.

이 책은 경제학의 300년 역사를 선택 이론을 중심으로 펼쳐내며 새로운 서사를 제안한다. 그 서사의 축은 위험과 불확실성 그리고 인간(더 정확히는 인간의 욕망)이다. 그에 따라 경제적 의사결정에 가장 기본적 척도인 효용(재화나 용역에 대한 주관적인 만족의 정도) 이론을 태동시킨 수학자들(니콜라스 베르누이, 다니엘 베르누이, 레몽 드 몽모르, 가브리엘 크라메르)과 존 로크, 제러미 벤담 등 사상가들부터 ‘한계효용체감의 법칙’의 3인방(윌리엄 스탠리 제번스, 레옹 발라, 카를 멩거), ‘게임 이론’의 창시자 존 폰 노이만, 시카고학파의 시조 밀턴 프리드먼…]]></summary>

투자에 실패한 사람들은 정부 탓, 사회 탓을 한다. 자신의 욕망과 무지를 자책하는 사람은 없다. 투자 수익을 올릴 땐 자신의 능력이고, 손실을 보면 금융감독원이 세금만 받아먹고 하는 일이 없어서 그렇다고 말한다.

 『금융시장의 포식자들』은 때로 아플 정도로 시장경제의 민낯에 대해 얘기한다. 금융시장에서 포식자로 자리잡은 대기업, 최대주주, 기관, 글로벌 기업, 이웃나라인 일본과 중국에 대해 그동안 우리는 잘못된 시각을 지니고 있었다.

대기업 승계와 지배구조 개편 이면의 돈의 흐름, 글로벌 기업들의 한계와 솔루션, 지정학적으로 밀접한 관계를 맺고 있는 일본과 중국의 경제에 대한 냉혹한 판단까지 금융시장을 이끌어가는 포식자들의 면면을 통렬히 해부하고 있다. 이 책의 핵심 메시지는 이렇다. 돈을 벌기 위해서라면 그동안 낡은 피식자의 프레임을 벗어 던지고 포식자의 논리를 깨달아야 한다고 말이다.

프롤로그 _시장에 대해서는 낙관하되 현실에서는 냉철해져라

포식자 마인드 체크포인트

첫 번째 포식자, 대기업
당신이 삼성을 보는 시각은 틀렸다
재벌 개혁? 웃기지 마. 목적은 돈이잖아
SK의 미래가 SK하이닉스인 이유
삼성물산과 제일모직의 합병, 한국인으로서 부끄럽다?
전문 경영인은 연봉을 위해 일한다
가난한 사람은 절대 모르는 부자의 고통
작가의 직설 / 엘시티는 죄가 없다 _엘시티 소유주의 고백
분식회계 좀 했는데 왜요? 그게 뭐 잘못인가요?
전문 경영인과 오너 경영인, 누가 옳은가?
대기업 총수 절반이 범법자인 나라, 정상입니까?
작가의 직설 / 라이벌 LG화학과 SK이노베이션의 쌍둥이 같은 물적 분할

포식자 행세하는 피식자, 노조
대체 가능한 인력일수록 노조에 목을 맨다
애플, 테슬라, 구글, 페이스북은 왜 노조를 싫어할까?
희망 없는 도요타의 미래가 일본의 미래다
투자자 노후는 불안한데 노조는 착실히 밥그릇을 챙긴다
기업의 가장 큰 죄는 부도덕이 아니라 이윤을 못 내는 것이다
노조가 없는 산업은 대체 불가한 미래 산업이다
작가의 직설 / 링컨은 노예를 해방할 생각이 없었다

두 번째 포식자, 기관
단타 치는 기관 관계자들이 왜 밖에서는 장기 투자를 추천할까?
ESG는 미래가 아니라 지독한 이기주의다
작가의 직설 / 힘없는 피식자가 공정을 부르짖는다

세 번째 포식자, 글로벌 기업
테슬라교 교주 일론 머스크가 바라는 건 믿음이 아니라 헌금이다
노조가 없어서 발전한 테슬라, 노조가 없어서 망한다
포식자들은 신화 너머의 추락을 늘 염두에 두고 있다
아마존은 내려갈 일만 남았다
시장의 한계를 인지한 상상력이 돈이 된다
작가의 직설 / 스파에서 대기업 부회장을 마주치다

네 번째 포식자, 이웃나라 일본과 중국
일본 산업은 외래종 유입을 반대하는 섬에 갇혔다
세계 1등이라서 쓰러질 수밖에 없는 시총 1위 도요타
욕망이 없으면 부의 전환도 없다
피로 얻은 건 빼앗기지 않는다
일본 정치인, 너 이름이 뭐니?
일본을 기다리는 건 디폴트의 늪이다
한국을 미워하는 건 일본이 열등하다는 증거다
작가의 ...

투자에 성공한 수많은 사람의 필승 전략이 책, 유튜브에 넘쳐나는 지금도 여전히 실패하는 사람이 많은 이유는 무엇일까? 그 이유는 투자에 정답이 없기 때문이다. 무조건 성공한다는 비법도 개개인이 처한 상황과 심리에 따라 수익률이 천차만별로 달라진다. 투자의 원리, 자산배분과 장기투자의 이유를 스스로 이해하고 체득하지 않는 이상, 수익은 운으로 잠깐 얻는 것일 뿐 평생 불안하고 초조한 투자를 이어갈 수밖에 없다.

『사경인의 친절한 투자 과외』는 금융&증권 업계의 스타 강사 사경인이 사랑하는 가족에게 직접 전한 8번의 투자 강의를 엮은 책이다. 여의도 증권인이 아닌 코스피, 코스닥도 모르는 왕초보 아내의 눈높이에 맞춰 차근차근 풀어낸 친절한 이 책에는 사랑하는 가족이 누구보다 안정적이고, 현명한 투자를 하길 바라는 사경인 회계사의 진심이 담겨 있다.

프롤로그 내가 없어도 투자를 이어갈 당신을 위해

오리엔테이션 아내는 왜 주식투자가 배우고 싶어졌을까?
여보, 나도 주식 좀 가르쳐줘
1:1 원격 강의를 시작하다
투자의 단계와 방법은 다양하다! 하지만 투자를 잘하기 위해서는 많은 공부가 필요하다
투자에 사용하는 평균부터 다시 배우자
이지영의 생각 내가 잘 배울 수 있을까?
사경인의 생각 버핏은 왜 아내에게 자신의 유산을 인덱스펀드에 맡기라고 했을까?
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 주식투자 전 마음 다잡기

1일차 주식과 부동산, 뭐가 더 좋을까?
강남 아파트 대신 삼성전자 샀으면, 타워팰리스가 3채?
우량주를 사서 장기투자하라는 미신
사례가 아닌 통계를 봐라
코스피지수와 아파트가격지수를 비교해 보자
다 더해서 나누는 산술평균, 다 곱해서 나누는 기하평균
더하기 평균의 단리수익률과 곱하기 평균의 복리수익률
자료의 둔갑술에 속지 마라
주식과 부동산, 180번의 진검승부
하지만 이겨도 이긴 게 아니다
수익률만 쫓다 놓치게 되는 중요한 한 가지 
이지영의 생각 걱정보다는 훨씬 재미있고, 이해가 쉽네
사경인의 생각 사례와 통계를 구분하는 습관이 필요하다 
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 과거와 지금의 수익률을 비교해 보자

2일차 투자의 가성비를 따져보자
가격의 변동성은 왜 위험이 될까?
투자할 때 겪는 마음고생을 가늠하는 지표
가격지수의 상승률만 비교해서는 안 된다
주식보다 부동산이 낫다! 하지만…… 
나눠서 투자하면 좋은 수학적인 이유
돈을 나누는 것과 시간을 나누는 것의 차이
거꾸로 하는 잘못된 투자
손실게임을 수익게임으로 바꾸는 도박사의 공식
고수와 똑같이 투자해도 나만 손해가 나는 이유
자산배분이 먼저다
이지영의 생각 조급해하지 말고, 하나씩 천천히 배워가자
사경인의 생각 도박과 투자는 한 끗 차이
보충수업 투자 성과를 비교하는 다양한 지표들 
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 직접 MDD를 계산해 보자

3일차 자산배분, 어떻게 할 것인가?
얼마까지의 MDD를 견뎌낼 수 있는가?
큰 욕심 안 부리고 1년에 20% 수익만 내고 싶다?
복리라면 5%도 결코 나쁘지 않다

제1차 세계 대전이 시작될 무렵, 어느 한 젊은 학자가 사이드카가 달린 오토바이를 타고 런던으로 떠났다. 당시 잉글랜드에는 역사상 가장 지독한 금융 위기가 터진 지 5일 째가 되는 날이었고, 유럽을 휩쓸어버린 전쟁이 본격적으로 시작되는 시기였다. 영국은 전쟁과 경제 위기로 촉발된 공포와 혼란으로 가득했다. 

젊은 학자는 이러한 위기와 혼란을 잠재울 수 있는 획기적인 방법을 제안하였다. 영국은 젊은 학자의 제안을 받아들였고, 긴박한 위기 상황에서 벗어날 수 있었다. 런던을 위기에서 탈출하게 만든 젊은 학자는 바로 존 메이너드 케인스였다. 그는 이 사건을 통해 무명의 학자에서 당대 가장 영향력 있는 지식인으로 자리 잡을 수 있었다.

베테랑 저널리스트 재커리 D. 카터는 그의 첫 번째 책에서 존 메이너드 케인스의 개인적인 삶과 학문적, 문화적, 정치적 활동을 절묘하게 엮어낸다. 흔히 케인스는 뛰어난 경제학자로만 알려져 있다. 그러나 카터는 케인스가 탁월한 반권위주의 사상가였으며, 예술과 사상이 전쟁과 결핍을 정복할 수 있다는 믿음에 평생을 바쳤던 인물이었음을 그의 생애를 통해 소개한다. 

도덕 철학자, 정치 이론가, 정치가이기도 했던 케인스는 예술가와 지성인의 안식처인 런던 블룸즈버리 그룹에서부터 유럽과 미국 두 대륙의 주식 시장 붕괴, 뉴햄프셔 브레튼우즈에서의 협상, 런던의 호화로운 코벤트 가든에서 열린 발레 공연, 베르사유 조약이 이루어진 파리 회의에 이르기까지 다양한 역사적 순간에서 두각을 나타냈다. 이처럼 카터는 케인스의 다채로운 면모를 보여주면서 단순히 경제학자로 국한될 인물이 결코 아니라는 사실을 깨닫게 한다.

동시대 디지털 기술세계의 확대에 의해 파생되는 ‘피지털’계의 등장을 주목한다. ‘피지털’은 ‘피지컬’과 ‘디지털’을 합친 조어로, 두 공간 지각이 뒤섞인 혼합 현실을 지칭한다. 『피지털 커먼즈』는 거의 모든 유무형 자원을 포획하고 뭇 생명을 예속화하려는 플랫폼자본주의의 인클로저 질서에 맞서서 지속가능한 공통의 미래 대안을 찾기 위한 시도이다. 현실과 가상의 경계가 무너지는 ‘피지털’ 현실에서 우리는 어떤 호혜의 공통장을 기획할 수 있을까? 

오늘날 플랫폼자본주의는 디지털계의 기술 논리를 갖고 물질계의 지형과 배치를 좌우하는 역전된 현실을 만들어내고 있다. 우리 사회가 ‘메타버스’에 바치는 숭고와 찬양은 플랫폼 자본이 주도할 피지털계의 인클로저를 알리는 서곡에 해당한다. 이 책은 피지털계의 자본주의적 왜곡을 경고한다. 인간 삶의 조건을 위협하는 이 플랫폼 인클로저 질서를 넘어설 수 있을까? 

이 책은 플랫폼 질서에 맞서 다른 삶의 직조를 위해 그리고 대안 실천의 무기력을 깨우기 위한 방법으로서 ‘커먼즈’(공통장) 운동을 제안한다. ‘인류세’ 국면 인간-기술-생태의 앙상블을 도모하기 위한 전제 조건은 무엇인가? ‘인류세’ 국면 생태 커먼즈의 구성 논의는 동시대 가장 화급한 쟁점이다. 특히 『피지털 커먼즈』는 생태 커먼즈의 구성에 있어서 인간 기술과 뭇 생명과…]]></summary>

변화하는 국제 정세 속에서 새로운 중심지로 떠오른 동북아시아의 대표 국가 남북중의 관계에 대해 다루고, 나아가 동북아의 밝은 미래를 위한 남북중의 협력 방안을 모색한다.

1997년의 아시아 외환위기 이후 2000년대에 동아시아 지역주의의 움직임이 활성화되어 많은 역내 정책 협력이 추진되었다. 하지만 현재 동북아시아는 미중 전략 경쟁, 급변하는 남북관계, 코로나19로 인한 보건 위기 등 다양한 위기 상황에 놓여 있다. 

미중 전략경쟁은 지금부터 시작이고 보건 위기는 언젠가 해소될 가능성이 높지만, 당분간은 교류협력이 어려운 것이 현실이다. 이렇듯 침체된 국제 분위기 속이기에 더욱, 변화하는 현실 속에서 남북중이 교류와 협력을 통해 보다 상호이익의 관계로 한 발짝 더 다가갈 수 있도록 만들 논의가 필요하다.

이에 한반도 문제를 포함한 동북아 정세에 대한 공통의 관심을 가지고 그간 부산과 창춘에서 공동으로 한중 동북아지역 협력세미나를 주최해온 동서대학교 동아시아연구원 중국연구센터와 지린대학교 동북아연구원은 협력 5주년을 기념하여 이 책을 발간하고, 이를 통해 남북중 3자 협력의 초석을 마련하고자 한다.

도시재생의 성공적인 사례와 방법론이 넘치는 가운데 사업이 종료된 이후의 지속가능성을 고민하고 해결책을 제시한 책이 나왔다. 도시재생 현장에서 현실적인 문제를 접해온 저자들이 도시재생사업이 종료된 이후에도 지역경제를 이끌어갈 방법을 모색한 책이다. 저자들은 재개발, 개건축과는 달리 쇠퇴한 지역을 주민들이 주도해 문제를 해결하고 경제 활성화를 달성하기 위해 도시재생기업에 주목한다.

도시재생기업은 사회적기업, 마을기업, 협동조합 등의 이름으로 지원사업이나 공모사업을 통해 문을 열었다. 하지만 비즈니스에 대한 이해나 교육, 아이템의 부족 등 사업 지속성에 한계를 겪고 어려움에 처해 있는 조직이 많다. 저자들은 지속가능한 도시재생을 한 단계 끌어올릴 지역경제 비즈니스 모델을 제시한다.

제1편 도시재생의 이해
제1장 도시재생을 알아보자
도시는 혼자 살아갈 수 없다 | 서울은 어떻게 지금의 모습을 갖추었을까? | 도시재생은 어떻게 시작되었을까? | 도시재생을 하면 무엇이 좋아질까? | 어떻게 하면 도시재생이 지속될 수 있을까?

제2편 도시재생경제조직의 사업화(지역공동체조직의 사업화)
제1장 도시재생경제조직을 파악하자
시작하는 이유를 명확히 하자 | 열정과 행동을 구체화하자 | 사업화는 지역팀이 중심이다 | 방향과 신뢰가 중요하다
제2장 무엇을 어떻게 변화시킬 것인지 정하자
0(zero)의 중요성 | 조직에 대한 세 가지 오해 | 내 아이디어에 관심을 보이는 이를 파악한다 | 특정 개인과 구매과정을 주시하라 | 우리가 팔고자 하는 상품(서비스)을 제대로 알리자 | 말은 그만하고 숫자로 제시하라 | 비즈니스 모델과 사업계획서는 다르다 | 어디서부터 시작할지 구체적으로 정하라 | 테스트 제품부터 시작하라 | 모든 것을 융합하여 설명하자
제3장 우리 조직(나)이 더 하고 싶은 것은 무엇인가?(스케일업을 위한 전략)
고객이 참여하고 대화하도록 이끌자 | 당장 디지털화를 시작하자 | 비즈니스 모델을 다시 그리자 | 지역자원 활용범위의 확대를 기획하자 | 창업에서의 상권 vs. 도시재생에서의 상권, 관점이 다르다 | 민간투자를 목표로 성장전략을 수립해 보자 | 도시재생경제조직은 공공성과 경제성의 균형이 중요하다 | 이제부터가 시작이다

제3편 도시재생기업이란 무엇인가?
제1장 서울 도시재생기업의 이해
서울 도시재생기업이란? | 서울 도시재생기업에서는 무엇을 할까? | 서울 도시재생기업 어떻게 진행될까? | 서울 도시재생기업 어떻게 선정할까? | 서울 도시재생기업 어떻게 육성될까?
제2장 서울 도시재생기업의 사례
서울 도시재생 사회적협동조합 | 암사 도시재생 사회적협동조합 | 서울로 마을닥터 목공 협동조합
