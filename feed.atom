Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of September 24th, inventory was at 433 thousand (7 day average), compared to 568 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.8%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55% from 963 thousand.


A week ago, inventory was at 436 thousand, and was down 23.8% YoY.   Three weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far).


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February).  Now inventory may be peaking for the year.   Inventory was about 41.1% above the record low in early April.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for September.]]></summary>

This paper studies how firms react to electoral violence using the case of Kenyan flower exporters during the 2008 post-election violence as an example. The violence induced a large negative supply shock that reduced exports primarily through workers' absence and had heterogeneous effects: larger firms and those with direct contractual relationships in export markets suffered smaller production and losses of workers. On the demand side, global buyers were not able to shift sourcing to Kenyan exporters located in areas not directly affected by the violence nor to neighboring Ethiopian suppliers. Consistent with difficulties in insuring against supply-chain risk disruptions caused by electoral violence, firms in direct contractual relationships ramp up shipments just before the subsequent 2013 presidential election to mitigate risk.]]></summary>

We found that the proportion of maternal hospitalizations with marijuana use disorder increased by 23% (0.3 percentage points) in the first three years after RML implementation, with larger effects in states authorizing commercial sales of marijuana. This growth was accompanied by a 7% (0.4 percentage points) decline in tobacco use disorder hospitalizations, yielding a net zero effect over all substance use disorder hospitalizations. RMLs were not associated with changes in newborn health. MMLs had no significant effect on maternal substance use disorder hospitalizations nor on newborn health and fairly small effects could be ruled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We examine the effects of bank merger and local market characteristics on local small business lending.  Mergers involving small, in-state acquirers are positively associated with small business loan (SBL) originations in counties where target banks are located.  Conversely, mergers involving large, out-of-state acquirers are associated with fewer SBL originations.  The analysis suggests that the results are driven by acquirer’s choice of target.  Small and in-state acquirers target banks that focus more on SBL and targets with strong relationships while large, out-of-state acquirers pursue better performing banks with stronger balance sheets and less focus on SBL.  Results are particularly strong in counties with a large number of small firms.  Post-merger activity supports banks expanding on their acquisition strategy decisions.  The findings suggest that acquirer strategy is important for evaluating the impact of acquisitions on local community development and that one-size-fits-all policy solutions for bank mergers may not produce common local outcomes.]]></summary>

We show a robust increase in mobility between the 1910s and 1940s cohorts, about half of which is driven by absolute convergence in racial income gaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper documents a set of facts about the dramatic decline in birth rates in the United States between 2007 and 2020 and explores possible explanations. The overall reduction in the birth rate reflects declines across many groups of women, including women who differ by race and ethnicity, age, and level of education. The Great Recession contributed to the decline in the early part of this period, but we are unable to identify any other economic, policy, or social factor that has changed since 2007 that is responsible for much of the decline beyond that. Mechanically, the falling birth rate can be attributed to changes in birth patterns across recent cohorts of women moving through childbearing age. We conjecture that the “shifting priorities” of more recent cohorts, reflecting changes in preferences for having children, aspirations for life, and parenting norms, may be responsible. We conclude with a brief discussion about the societal consequences for a declining birth rate and what the United States might do about it.]]></summary>

The major preference channel is asymmetric in social outcomes – although negative and positive responsible investment (RI) externalities have the same magnitudes, negative externalities have greater impact on investment choices. The effect is persistent, but heterogenous. We also find asymmetries in belief formation and learning constitute a secondary channel. Overall, our results are consistent with important stylized empirical facts and the predictions of recent RI theories that social preferences lead to different investment choices, but our analyses also suggest important future modeling directions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transformation of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) into a more generous, inclusive monthly payment marks a historic (temporary) shift in U.S. treatment of low-income families. To investigate the initial impact of these payments, we apply a series of difference-in-difference estimates using Census Household Pulse Survey microdata collected from April 14 through August 16, 2021. Our findings offer three primary conclusions regarding the initial effects of the monthly CTC. First, payments strongly reduced food insufficiency: the initial payments led to a 7.5 percentage point (25 percent) decline in food insufficiency among low-income households with children. Second, the effects on food insufficiency are concentrated among families with 2019 pre-tax incomes below $35,000, and the CTC strongly reduces food insufficiency among low-income Black, Latino, and White families alike. Third, increasing the CTC coverage rate would be required in order for material hardship to be reduced further. Self-reports suggest the lowest-income households were less likely than higher-income families to receive the first CTC payments. As more children receive the benefit in future months, material hardship may decline further. Even with imperfect coverage, however, our findings suggest that the first CTC payments were largely effective at reducing food insufficiency among low-income families with children.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We report the labor market effects of the Jamaica Early Childhood Stimulation intervention at age 31. The study is a small-sample randomized early childhood education stimulation intervention targeting stunted children living in the poor neighborhoods of Kingston, Jamaica. Implemented in 1987-1989, treatment consisted of a two-year home-based intervention designed to improve nutrition and the quality of mother-child interactions to foster cognitive, language and psycho-social skills. The original sample is 127 stunted children between 9 and 24 months old. Our study is able to track and interview 75% of the original sample 30 years after the intervention, both still living in Jamaica and migrated abroad. We find large and statistically significant effects on income and schooling; the treatment group had 43% higher hourly wages and 37% higher earnings than the control group. This is a substantial increase over the treatment effect estimated for age 22 where we observed a 25% increase in earnings. The Jamaican Study is a rare case of a long-term follow up for an early childhood development (ECD) intervention implemented in a less-developed country. Our results confirm large economic returns to an early childhood intervention that targeted disadvantaged families living in poverty in the poor neighborhoods of Jamaica. The Jamaican intervention is being replicated around the world. Our analysis provides justification for expanding ECD interventions targeting disadvantaged children living in poor countries around the world.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last decade, Gulf countries have imposed hiring quotas to promote the participation of natives in the private sector and address high levels of unemployment, particularly among women and the youth. This paper explores how one such policy, Nitaqat in Saudi Arabia, affected the outcomes of exporting firms, the most productive sector of the non-oil economy.  We find that whereas the policy was successful in increasing the employment of Saudi nationals by these firms, it came at a high cost. In the year following the announcement of the policy, relative to firms above the quota, firms below the quota were 1.5 percentage points more likely to exit the market, 7 percentage points less likely to export, and conditional on exporting, the value of their exports fell by 14 percent. Additionally, surviving treated firms reduced their labor force by 10 percent. We find that to comply with the policy, firms hired mostly lower-wage, low-skilled Saudis. The policy doubled the share of women in treated firms. Importantly, we find that these short-term effects persisted for at least three years after the policy’s implementation.]]></summary>

Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, introduces the concept of Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium, discusses existence and multiplicity, and describes the representation of this equilibrium in terms of conditional choice probabilities. We also discuss extensions of the basic framework, including models in continuous time, the concepts of oblivious equilibrium and experience-based equilibrium, and dynamic games where firms have non-equilibrium beliefs. In section 3, we first provide an overview of the types of data used in this literature, before turning to a discussion of identification issues and results, and estimation methods. We review different methods to deal with multiple equilibria and large state spaces. We also describe recent developments for estimating games in continuous time and incorporating serially correlated unobservables, and discuss the use of machine learning methods to solving and estimating dynamic games. Section 4 discusses empirical applications of dynamic games in IO. We start describing the first empirical applications in this literature during the early 2000s. Then, we review recent applications dealing with innovation, antitrust and mergers, dynamic pricing, regulation, product repositioning, advertising, uncertainty and investment, airline network competition, dynamic matching, and natural resources.

However, little research has examined the relationship between local economic conditions and healthcare employment. Understanding how the healthcare sector responds to economic conditions is important for policy makers seeking to ensure an adequate supply of healthcare workers, as well as for those directing displaced workers into new jobs. We examine the impact of macroeconomic conditions on both the healthcare labor market and the pipeline of healthcare workers receiving healthcare degrees during a pre-COVID time period, 2005-2017. Our results indicate that the healthcare sector is stable across past business cycles. If anything, when areas experience more severe local economic downturns, healthcare employment increases. Much remains unknown about the adjustments and lasting impacts for the healthcare sector associated with the COVID era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the effects of fiscal policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the firm, sector, country and global level. First, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and policy responses on small and medium sized enterprise (SME) business failures. We combine firm-level financial data from 50 sectors in 27 countries, a detailed I-O network, real-time data on lockdown policies and mobility patterns, and a rich model of firm behavior that allows for several dimensions of heterogeneity. We find: (a) Absent government support, the failure rate of SMEs would have increased by 9 percentage points, significantly more so in emerging market economies (EMs). With policy support it only increased by 4.3 percentage points, and even decreased in advanced economies (AEs). (b) Fiscal policy was poorly targeted: most of the funds disbursed went to firms who did not need it. (c) Nevertheless, we find little evidence of the policy merely postponing mass business failures or creating many ‘zombie’ firms: failure rates rise only slightly in 2021 once policy support is removed. Next, we build a tractable global intertemporal general equilibrium I-O model with fiscal policy. We calibrate the model to 64 countries and 36 sectors. We find that: (d) a sizable share of the global economy is demand-constrained under COVID-19, especially so in EMs. (e) Globally, fiscal policy helped offset about 8% of the downturn in COVID, with a low ‘traditional’ fiscal multiplier. Yet it significantly reduced the share of demand- constrained sectors, preserving employment in these sectors. (f) Fiscal policy exerted small and negative spillovers to output in other countries but positive spillovers on employment. (g) A two-speed recovery would put significant upwards pressure on global interest rates which imposes an additional headwind on the EM recovery. (h) Corporate and sovereign spreads rise when global rates increase, suggesting that EM may face challenging external funding conditions as AEs economies normalize.]]></summary>

We report on a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted with 19,000 households in rural Bangladesh where we randomized (1) either group financial incentives or a non-financial “social recognition” reward, and (2) asking each household to make either a private pledge or a public pledge to maintain hygienic latrines. The group financial reward has the strongest impact in the short term (3 months), inducing a 7.5-12.5 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership. Getting people to publicly commit to maintaining and using a hygienic latrine in front of their neighbors induced a 4.2-6.1 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership in the short term. In the medium term (15 months), the effect of the financial reward dissipates while the effect of the public commitment persists. Neither social recognition nor private commitments produce effects statistically distinguishable from zero.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Privatization of a public good (the management of sewage treatment centers in Dakar, Senegal) leads to an increase in the productivity of downstream sewage dumping companies and a decrease in downstream prices of the services they provide to households. We use the universe of legal dumps of sanitation waste from May 2009 to November 2018 to show that legal dumping increased substantially following privatization–on average an increase of 61.7%, or an increase of about 14,000 cubic meters each month. This is due to increased productivity of all trucks, not just those associated with the company managing the treatment centers. Household-level survey data shows that prices of legal sanitary dumping decreased by ten percent following privatization, and DHS data show that diarrhea rates among children under five decreased in Dakar relative to secondary cities in Senegal following privatization with no similar effect on respiratory illness as a placebo.]]></summary>

We provide novel evidence on foreigners' U.S. Treasury portfolios based on data not yet used by researchers: the security-level Treasury portfolios of foreigners and private U.S. investors. We find that private foreign investors earn above market returns and on a risk-adjusted basis both foreign private and foreign official investors outperform U.S. investors. Moreover, while foreign officials, with their broader objective functions, may well have inelastic demand, private foreign investors increase purchases of Treasuries and increase the duration of their Treasury portfolios when their sovereign yields are low or decrease relative to Treasury yields (that is, when CIP deviations decrease). Our results are so different from existing results that we close with a reconciliation exercise that provides a useful assessment of different sources of data on flows and holdings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This chapter (to appear in the forthcoming Handbook of International Economics, Vol. 5) develops a framework with which to interpret and survey answers to the question: how does increased openness affect aggregate welfare in a typical developing country? We decompose answers into four mechanisms: (i) an effect akin to technological progress that is purely mechanical; (ii) an effect on factoral terms of trade; (iii) a distortion revenue effect that exacerbates or mitigates the consequences of domestic distortions; and (iv) an effect of trade on the magnitude of those distortions themselves. Our focus lies in the last two mechanisms as these are especially important for the study of low-income settings where domestic distortions are thought to be rife. Throughout, we provide both a review of existing work on these topics and quantitative calculations that aim to gauge the magnitudes involved in a global model that is calibrated to match firm- and industry-level data on trade flows, production techniques, and a host of distortions (tariffs, other taxes, markups, bribes, theft, credit constraints, contracting failures, labor regulations, and public utility provision) that have featured in the literature.]]></summary>

But, we know little about why education increases political participation or whether higher-quality education increases civic participation. We study applicants to Boston charter schools, using school lotteries to estimate charter attendance impacts for academic and voting outcomes. First, we confirm large academic gains for students in the sample of charter schools and cohorts investigated here. Second, we find that charter attendance boosts voter participation. Voting in the first presidential election after a student turns 18 increased substantially, by six percentage points from a base of 35 percent. The voting effect is driven entirely by girls and there is no increase in voter registration. Rich data and the differential effects by gender enable exploration of multiple potential channels for the voting impact. We find evidence consistent with two mechanisms: charter schools increase voting by increasing students’ noncognitive skills and by politicizing families who participate in charter school education.]]></summary>

We show that straightforward reasons cannot explain this behavior. We propose a model where colleges compete on prestige, measured using relative selectivity or relative admit rates. A key comparative static of the model is that higher demand decreases [increases] the admit rate when the weight on prestige is above [below] a critical value, consistent with experience in elite [non-elite] colleges. A calibrated version of the model closely replicates the pattern in the data of declining admit rates at elite colleges while counter-factual simulations without prestige fail. Prestige competition is inefficient. Allowing elite colleges to collude on admissions strategy internalizes the non-pecuniary prestige externality and is Pareto improving.]]></summary>

Intuitively, the smaller the bias towards more durable goods, the less the recovery is buffeted by pent-up demand. We show that, in a standard multi-sector business-cycle model, this prediction holds if and only if, following an aggregate demand shock to all categories of spending (e.g., a monetary shock), expenditure on more durable goods reverts back faster. This testable condition receives ample support in U.S. data. We then use (i) a semi-structural shift-share and (ii) a structural model to quantify this effect of varying demand composition on recovery dynamics, and find it to be large. We also discuss implications for optimal stabilization policy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We examine the start date of the Great Recession across OECD countries based on two successive quarters of negative GDP growth recession.  For most OECD countries this establishes the start of recession in Q22008 or Q32008.  We find that the Sahm Rule identifies the start of recession in the US to the beginning of 2008 but in other OECD countries it identifies the start in almost every case, after that identified by GDP.  But the GDP and labor market data are subject to major revisions, so the turn is not apparent in most countries for some time.  We establish our own rule for predicting recession using the fear of unemployment series to predict recession.  It involves looking for a ten-point rise in the series compared to its previous twelve month low.  These surveys are timely and have the major advantage they are not subject to revision. Across the OECD we confirm this finding with other types of qualitative data and especially so in the UK.  Qualitative surveys, we show, in the US in 2006 and 2007 predicted the subsequent recession and they did the same in Europe at the end of 2007 and in the early part of 2008.]]></summary>

We use CPS data from January 2016 to June 2021, limiting the sample to childless individuals who lack a college degree. In the younger group (aged 15-19), we observe the expected sharp reduction in outcomes at the start of the pandemic, followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels of work hours, employment, and labor force participation starting in September 2020, with outcomes even surpassing pre-pandemic levels in April and May 2021. In the older age group (20-24-year-olds), however, work hours, employment, and labor force participation were still lagging below pre-pandemic levels as of June 2021. As of June 2021, weekly earnings and hourly wages were higher than typical pre-pandemic levels for that month for both age groups. Although we cannot test directly whether enhanced UI programs have played a role in these differences by age group, our findings show that within the 15-24-year-old age group, there is significant heterogeneity in labor market recovery from the COVID-19 recession.]]></summary>

Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that adopting a robot drives prostate cancer patients to the hospital. To test whether this result reflects market expansion or business stealing, we also consider market-level effects of adoption and find they are significant but smaller, suggesting that adoption expands the market while also reallocating some patients across hospitals. Marginal patients are relatively young and healthy, inconsistent with the concern that adoption broadens the criteria for intervention to patients who would gain little from it.

The factors usually associated with big shifts in policy—a macroeconomic crisis, a change in political power or institutions, lobbying by export interests, pressure from international financial institutions—were not present; it was ideas that were key. In 1954, economist S. C. Tsiang proposed that Taiwan boost export earnings rather than squeeze import spending to deal with its chronic shortage of foreign exchange. He recommended a currency devaluation to establish a realistic exchange rate and a market-based system of foreign exchange allocation to end the inefficient rationing by the government. Four years later, a leading policymaker, K. Y. Yin, fought for the adoption of Tsiang’s proposal, helping clear the way for Taiwan’s phenomenal growth in trade.]]></summary>

The data show a gradual shift over the past centuries from the  traditional interventions of a lender-of-last-resort, suspensions of convertibility, and bank holidays, towards a much more prominent role for capital injections and  sweeping guarantees of bank liabilities. Furthermore, intervention frequencies and  sizes suggest that the crisis problem in the financial sector has indeed reached an  apex during the post-Bretton Woods era – but that such trends are part of a more  deeply entrenched development that saw global intervention frequencies and sizes  gradually rise since at least the late 17th century.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1960, South Korea’s exports were about 1 percent of GDP, and the country’s ability to import depended almost entirely on US aid. After changing its foreign exchange and trade policies in the mid-1960s, Korea saw a surge in exports to more than 10 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. What factors account for the shift in policy that enabled this dramatic export growth to occur? The United States helped initiate the process by withholding financial assistance, pressuring Korea to devalue its currency and reform its foreign exchange regime. Initially, the Korean government resisted taking these steps, but in 1964 it became firmly committed to an export promotion strategy to boost foreign exchange earnings and end its dependence on American aid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We fully solve an assignment problem with heterogeneous firms and multiple heterogeneous workers whose skills are imperfect substitutes, that is, when production is submodular. We show that sorting is neither positive nor negative and is characterized sufficiently by two regions. In the first region, mediocre firms sort with mediocre workers and coworkers such that output losses are equal across all these pairings (complete mixing). In the second region, high skill workers sort with a low skill coworker and a high productivity firm, while high productivity firms employ a low skill worker and a high skill coworker (pairwise countermonotonicity). The equilibrium assignment is also necessarily characterized by product countermonotonicity, meaning that sorting is negative for each dimension of heterogeneity with the product of heterogeneity in the other dimensions. The equilibrium assignment as well as wages and firm values are completely characterized in closed form. We illustrate our theory with an application to show that our model is consistent with the observed dispersion of earnings within and across U.S. firms. Our counterfactual analysis gives evidence that the change in the firm project distribution between 1981 and 2013 has a larger effect on the observed change in earnings dispersion than the change in the worker skill distribution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We experimentally study the impact of substantially larger enterprise loans, in collaboration with an Egyptian lender. Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals dramatic heterogeneity. Top-performers (i.e., those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, whereas profits for poor-performers drop. The magnitude of this difference implies that an individual lender’s credit allocation choices matter for aggregate income. Evidence on two fronts suggests large loans would be misallocated: top-performers are predicted by loan officers to have higher default rates; and, top-performers grow less than others when given small loans, implying that allocating larger loans based on prior performance is not efficient. Our results have important implications for credit expansion policy and our understanding of entrepreneurial talent: on the former, the use of psychometric data to identify top-performers suggests a pathway towards better allocation that revolves around entrepreneurial type more than firm type; on the latter, the reversal of fortune for poor-performers, who do well with small loans but not large, indicates a type of entrepreneur that we call a “go-getter” who performs well when constrained but poorly when not.]]></summary>

Using firm level data from 46 EMEs from 2000 to 2018, we document four findings. First, active IRM positively affects firm investment - the effect strengthens with the magnitude of adverse external financial shocks. Second, financially constrained firms, compared with unconstrained ones, are less responsive to active IRM. Third, our results suggest that the country credit spread is a plausible causal channel of the positive IRM effect on firm investment. Fourth, the policies of capital controls and exchange rate managements are complementary to the IRM – it is beneficial to form a macro policy mix including active IRM to safeguard firm investment against global financial shocks. Further, our results indicate the IRM effect on firm investment is both statistical and economical significance and is relevant to the aggregate economy.]]></summary>

We examine data taken at age 50 in 2008, when the Great Recession hit and then five years later at age 55 in 2013.  We find those suffering both short-term and chronic pain at age 44 continue to report pain and poor general health in their 50s.  However, the associations are much stronger for those with chronic pain.  Furthermore, chronic pain at age 44 is associated with a range of poor mental health outcomes, pessimism about the future and joblessness at age 55 whereas short-duration pain at age 44 is not.  Uniquely, we also show that pain experienced in childhood, at ages 11 and 16, reported by a parent and a teacher respectively, collected decades earlier, predicts pain in mid-life, indicating just how persistent pain can be over the life-course.]]></summary>

In a randomized control trial that varies the salience of female and minority representation on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy committee, the FOMC, we test whether diversity affects how Fed information influences consumers’ subjective beliefs. Women and Black respondents form unemployment expectations more in line with FOMC forecasts and trust the Fed more after this intervention. Women are also more likely to acquire Fed-related information when associated with a female official. White men, who are overrepresented on the FOMC, do not react negatively. Heterogeneous taste for diversity can explain these patterns better than homophily. Our results suggest more diverse policy committees are better able to reach underrepresented groups without inducing negative reactions by others, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of policy communication and public trust in the institution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unemployment rates differ widely across local labor markets. I offer new empirical evidence that high local unemployment emerges because of elevated local job losing rates. Local employers, rather than local workers, account for most of spatial gaps in job stability. I then propose a theory in which spatial differences in job loss arise endogenously, due to the spatial sorting of heterogeneous employers across local labor markets.  Labor market frictions induce productive employers to over-value locating close to each other. The optimal policy incentivizes them to relocate to areas with high job losing rates, providing a rationale for commonly used place-based policies. I estimate the model using French administrative data. The estimated model accounts for over three fourths of the cross-sectional dispersion in unemployment rates, as well as for the respective contributions of job losing and job finding rates. Employers' inefficient location choices amplify spatial unemployment differentials five-fold. Both real-world and optimal place-based policies can yield sizable local and aggregate welfare gains.]]></summary>

We study the role of relative value-added across colleges within student choice sets in producing these outcome disparities. Linking high school, college, and earnings registries spanning the state of Texas, we identify relative college value-added by comparing the outcomes of students who apply to and are admitted by the same set of institutions, as this approach strikingly balances observable student potential across college treatments and renders our extensive set of covariates irrelevant as controls. Methodologically, we develop a framework for identifying and interpreting value-added under varying assumptions about match effects and sorting gains. Empirically, we estimate a relatively tight, though non-degenerate, distribution of relative value-added across the wide diversity of Texas public universities. Selectivity poorly predicts value-added within student choice sets, with only a fleeting selectivity earnings premium fading to zero after a few years in the labor market. Non-peer college inputs like instructional spending more strongly predict value-added, especially conditional on selectivity. Colleges that boost BA completion, especially in STEM majors, also tend to boost earnings. Finally, we probe the potential for (mis)match effects by allowing value-added schedules to vary by student characteristics.]]></summary>

In a study of recent minimum wage changes, we demonstrate how analyses of medium- and long-run impacts of policy interventions can be pre-specified as extensions to short-run analyses. Further, our pre-analysis plan includes comparisons of the effects of large vs. small minimum wage increases, which is a theoretically motivated dimension of heterogeneity. We discuss how these use cases harness the strengths of pre-analysis plans while mitigating their weaknesses. This project’s initial analyses explored CPS and ACS data from 2011 through 2015. Alongside these analyses, we pre-committed to analyses incorporating CPS and ACS data extending through 2019. Averaging across the specifications in our pre-analysis plan, we estimate that relatively large minimum wage increases reduced employment rates among low-skilled individuals by just over 2.5 percentage points. Our estimates of the effects of relatively small minimum wage increases vary across data sets and specifications but are, on average, both economically and statistically indistinguishable from zero. We estimate that medium-run effects exceed short-run effects and that the elasticity of employment with respect to the minimum wage is substantially more negative for large minimum wage increases than for small increases.]]></summary>

We find that Chinese-named defendants were more likely to be dismissed by trial or acquitted by jury, and were found guilty on fewer counts, and on average received harsher indictments. These results are robust regardless of whether we consider all cases or only arguably ``marginal'' cases. We also find that, for those publicly listed victim firms whose trade secrets were allegedly stolen by the charged defendants, the stock market reaction was much more muted to the news on the case filing date if the charged defendants are of Chinese descent. Our study provides the first systematic evidence that the DOJ's prosecutorial decisions in the application of the EEA may have been tainted by ethnic prejudice against Chinese, including American citizens of Chinese descent.]]></summary>

We show that this approach explains many puzzles: separately treated departures from “rationality” such as probability weighting, menu effects, reference point effects, and framing, emerge as distinct manifestations of the same principle of bottom up attention to salient stimuli.

Increasingly, higher-SES children spend less time with their parents and more time in the care of others. Non-parental care for high-SES children is more likely to be in childcare centers, where average quality is higher, and less likely to be provided by relatives where average quality is lower. Even within types of childcare, higher-SES children tend to receive care of higher measured quality and higher cost. Inequality is evident at home as well: measures of parental enrichment at home, from both self-reports and outside observers, are on average higher for higher-SES children. We also find that parental and non-parental quality is reinforcing: children who receive higher quality non-parental care also tend to receive higher quality parental care. Head Start, one of the largest government care subsidy programs for low-income households, reduces inequality in care provided, but it is mainly limited to older children and to the lowest income households. Our evidence is from the pre-COVID-19 period, and the latest year we examine is 2019.]]></summary>

Moreover, for countries with excess capital out flows during this period, the impact on external balance sheet positions was mitigated by valuation gains. This is because, in contrast with past financial crises, many emerging markets did not experience negative external balance sheet effects from their currency depreciation, partly due to currency-induced valuation gains on equity positions offsetting losses on debt positions, partly due to reduced currency mismatch on their external debt positions.]]></summary>

This paper leverages a randomized experiment conducted by a large fintech lender to estimate welfare losses arising from asymmetric information in the market for online consumer credit. Building on methods from the insurance literature, we show how exogenous variation in interest rates can be used to estimate borrower demand and lender cost curves and recover implied welfare losses. While asymmetric information generates large equilibrium price distortions, we find only small overall welfare losses, particularly for high-credit-score borrowers.]]></summary>

This essay selectively reviews the copious literature that now exists on the long-term impact of natural disasters. At this point, the long-run resilience of cities to many forms of physical destruction, including bombing, earthquakes and fires, has been well-documented. The destruction of human capital may leave a longer imprint, but cities have persisted through many plagues over the past millennia. By contrast, economic and political shocks, including deindustrialization or the loss of capital city status, can enormously harm an urban area. These facts suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will only significantly alter urban fortunes, if it is accompanied by a major economic shift, such as widespread adoption of remote work, or political shifts that could lead businesses and the wealthy to leave urban areas. The combination of an increased ability to relocate with increased local redistribution or deterioration of local amenity levels or both could recreate some of the key attributes of the urban crisis of the 1970s.]]></summary>

Using a newly assembled dataset on U.S. companies between 1926 and 1940 combining information on corporate ownership, organization, research and innovation, we attempt to explain the rise of corporate research. We argue that it was driven by companies trying to take advantage of opportunities for innovation made possible by scientific advances and an underdeveloped academic research system in the United States. Measuring  field-specific scientific backwardness in several different ways, we find that large firms, business group affiliated firms, and firms close to the technological frontier were more likely to initiate scientific  research. We also find that companies in monopolistic or concentrated industries were more likely to  engage in basic research. Corporate research was positively correlated with novel and valuable patents, and with market-to-book ratios. For companies choosing to do so, investment in corporate research seems to have paid off. The results shed light on the link between corporate organization, market structure and corporate science.]]></summary>

We implement different semi-structured bargaining protocols based on deferred acceptance, and we compare their performance to the benchmark scenario of a sealed-bid auction. We show that bargaining dramatically improves efficiency, mainly to the benefit of players rather than the silent auctioneer. A protocol of unconstrained simultaneous bargaining performs best, doubling the proportion of deals relative to the benchmark. This is because participants seek to reveal information through a gradual bidding-up strategy that favors bargaining environments. Aggregate efficiency nonetheless suffers from the fact that buyers bargain harder than sellers, and that some players over-bargain to appropriate a larger share of the unknown surplus.]]></summary>

Using longitudinal student-level administrative data from Michigan and nationally representative data from the Census Household Pulse Survey, we show how the pandemic affected families’ choices of school sector. We document four central facts. First, public school enrollment declined noticeably in fall 2020, with about 3 percent of Michigan students and 10 percent of kindergartners using other options. Second, most of this was driven by homeschooling rates jumping substantially, driven largely by families with children in elementary school. Third, homeschooling increased more where schools provided in-person instruction while private schooling increased more where instruction was remote, suggesting heterogeneity in parental concerns about children’s physical health and instructional quality. Fourth, kindergarten declines were highest among low income and Black families while declines in other grades were highest among higher income and White families, highlighting important heterogeneity by students’ existing attachment to public schools. Our results shed light on how families make schooling decisions and imply potential longer-run disruptions to public schools in the form of decreased enrollment and funding, changed composition of the student body, and increased size of the next kindergarten cohort.]]></summary>

I show that if preferences are empathetic in the sense of depending on the well-being of others, then in an extreme case external effects are fully internalized, and private contributions to the provision of a public good will be sufficient for it to be provided at an efficient level. Furthermore I show that an increase in the level of empathy shown by any agent will lead to an increase in the level of provision of the public good, and that as empathy levels increase towards their upper bound, the level of provision of the public good converges to the efficient level. Under certain conditions an increase in empathy is Pareto improving. As it is well-documented that people display some degree of empathy, it is arguable that our failure to provide public goods at efficient levels is attributable to lack of empathy as well as to the free rider problem.]]></summary>

Using administrative data from Germany, we apply an event study design in combination with propensity score matching and a reweighting technique to directly compare men and women who are displaced from similar jobs and firms. Our results show that after a mass layoff, women’s earnings losses are about 35% higher than men’s, with the gap persisting five years after job displacement. This is partly explained by a higher propensity of women to take up part-time or marginal employment following job loss, but even full-time wage losses are almost 50% (or 5 percentage points) higher for women than for men. We then show that on the household level there is no evidence of an added worker effect, independent of the gender of the job loser. Finally, we document that parenthood magnifies the gender gap sharply: while fathers of young children have smaller earnings losses than men in general, mothers of young children have much larger earnings losses than other women.]]></summary>

We show that output, input use, and labor productivity of the targeted industries and regions grew significantly faster than those of non-targeted ones. While the plant-level total factor productivity also grew faster in targeted industries and regions, the misallocation of resources within them got significantly worse, especially among the entrants, so that the total factor productivity at the industry-region level did not increase relative to the non-targeted industries and regions. In addition, we provide new evidence on how industrial policy reshapes the economy: (i) The establishment size distribution of targeted industries and regions shifted to the right with thicker tails due to the entry of large establishments and (ii) the targeted industries became more important in the economy's input-output structure in the sense that their output multipliers increased significantly more.]]></summary>

All PT places that received funding for LNS schools and all PT places that did not were identified by examining program records and contemporaneous newspaper accounts. Focusing on students who in 1960 attended high school in the same city or town where they were born, we estimate intent to treat effects of access to LNS preschool on high school academic and social emotional outcomes and on educational attainment and labor outcomes at five and eleven years following high school graduation. Preschool boosts high school academic outcomes for men and (in at least one specification) income 11 years after high school graduation. For women, preschool exposure had a negative effect on some social emotional outcomes in high school. We found no or inconsistent effects for other outcomes. The Lanham experience demonstrates that even with the less sophisticated understanding of child development of the early 1940s, the first universal, government-funded preschool program had positive impacts on boys’ outcomes at least through high school. Given today’s expanded understanding of child development and focus on the quality of early care and education programming, these findings provide some optimism as communities, states, and the federal government contemplate expanding funding for today’s early learning environments.]]></summary>

In about nine out of 10 EMDEs, debt is higher now than it was in 2010 and, in half of the EMDEs, debt is more than 30 percentage points of gross domestic product higher. Historically, elevated debt levels increased the incidence of debt distress, particularly in EMDEs and particularly when financial market conditions turned less benign. This paper reviews an encompassing menu of options that have, in the past, helped lower debt burdens. Specifically, it examines orthodox options (enhancing growth, fiscal consolidation, privatization, and wealth taxation) and heterodox options (inflation, financial repression, debt default and restructuring). The mix of feasible options depends on country characteristics and the type of debt. However, none of these options comes without political, economic, and social costs. Some options may ultimately be ineffective unless vigorously implemented. Policy reversals in difficult times have been common. The challenges associated with debt reduction raise questions of global governance, including to what extent advanced economies can cast their net wider to cushion prospective shocks to EMDEs.]]></summary>

Our discussion emphasizes how empirical strategies can leverage different features of data depending on the sources of variation that are commonly found in applied work. Moving to the supply-side, we show how demand estimates combined with a pricing model, can be used to recover markups and marginal costs. We also show how the model of pricing can be tested. We discuss a baseline Bertrand-Nash model of competitive pricing, and expand it to cover a) coordinated pricing, b) wholesale relationships, and c) bargaining.

We use a simulated safety net eligibility approach that accounts for interactions across safety net programs and relies on changing policies across states and time to identify causal effects of safety net generosity on psychological distress and risky behaviors of single mothers. Our results suggest that a more generous safety net is protective of maternal mental health: we estimate that a $1000 increase to the combined cash and food benefit package reduces severe psychological distress by 5.5 percent. Breaking out effects by individual programs while still controlling for potential benefits from other programs, we find that this reduction is entirely due to simulated tax credit eligibility and appears to occur in the first half of the year, when such benefits are typically received. We find no significant effect of the overall safety net on risky behaviors like smoking and heavy drinking, but this masks offsetting effects of cash and food benefits, suggesting that the impact of improved financial resources depends on details of transfer program design.]]></summary>

We hypothesize that employers coerce victims into silence through the threat of a retaliatory firing, and test this theory by estimating whether external shocks that reduce the value of a worker's outside options exacerbate underreporting. Under mild assumptions, a rise in the severity of formal complaints is indicative of increased underreporting. Combining this insight with an objective measure of the quality of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), we perform two analyses. First, we assess whether workers report sexual harassment more selectively during recessions, when outside labor market options are limited. We estimate the fraction of sexual harassment charges deemed to have merit by the EEOC increases by 0.5-0.7% for each one percentage point increase in a state-industry's monthly unemployment rate. The effect is amplified in industries employing a larger fraction of men and in establishments with a higher share of male managers. Second, we test whether less generous UI benefits create economic incentives for victims of workplace sexual harassment to remain silent. We find the selectivity of sexual harassment charges increases by more than 30% in response to a 50% cut to North Carolina's Unemployment Insurance (UI) program following the Great Recession.]]></summary>

We test this idea at a global scale using a combination of ethnographic records, historical folklore information, global data on contemporary conflict events, and large-scale surveys. The data show systematic links between traditional herding practices and a culture of honor. First, the culture of pre-industrial societies that relied on animal herding emphasizes violence, punishment, and revenge-taking. Second, contemporary ethnolinguistic groups that historically subsisted more strongly on herding have more frequent and severe conflict today. Third, the contemporary descendants of herders report being more willing to take revenge and punish unfair behavior in the globally representative Global Preferences Survey. In all, the evidence supports the idea that this form of economic subsistence generated a functional psychology that has persisted until today and plays a role in shaping conflict across the globe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A large body of evidence finds that relative mobility in the US has declined over the past 150 years. However, long-run mobility estimates are usually based on white samples and therefore do not account for the limited opportunities available for non-white families. Moreover, historical data measure the father’s status with error, which biases estimates toward greater mobility. Using linked census data from 1850-1940, I show that accounting for race and measurement error can double estimates of intergenerational persistence. Updated estimates imply that there is greater equality of opportunity today than in the past, mostly because opportunity was never that equal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper provides causal evidence of the impact of industrial policy on firms' long-term performance and quantifies industrial policy's long-term welfare effects. Using a natural experiment and unique historical data during the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive in South Korea, we find large and persistent effects of firm-level subsidies on firm size. Subsidized firms are larger than those never subsidized even 30 years after subsidies ended. Motivated by this empirical finding, we build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these persistent effects through a combination of learning-by-doing (LBD) and financial frictions that hinder firms from internalizing LBD. The model is calibrated to firm-level micro data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. Counterfactual analysis implies that the industrial policy generated larger benefits than costs. If the industrial policy had not been implemented, South Korea's welfare would have been 22-31% lower, depending on how long-lived are the productivity benefits of LBD. Between one-half and two-thirds of the total welfare difference comes from the long-term effects of the policy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of September 21st.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Little Movement in Forbearance Volumes This Week
The number of active forbearance plans fell by 18,000 (-1.4%) this week, leaving 1.58 million U.S. homeowners in COVID-19 forbearance as of September [21].
Declines of 11,000 and 10,000 among FHA/VA and GSE loans respectively were partially offset by a 3,000 rise in PLS/portfolio plans. Overall, forbearances are now down 182,000 (-10%) from the same time last month, with the strongest decline (-13%) seen among GSE plans.
The population of mortgage holders in COVID-19 related forbearance plans represents 3% of all active mortgages, including 1.7% of GSE, 5.2% of FHA/VA and 3.8% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
In terms of forbearance plan starts, 15,000 new plans were initiated since last Tuesday – down slightly from last week’s 16,000 starts – while 34,000 plans were restarted, compared to last week’s volume of 35,000. Meanwhile, in typical mid-month behavior, plan exits dipped slightly this week, but are expected to ramp up in coming weeks.

  More than 460,000 plans are still slated for review for extension/removal over the final week of September, with some 300,000 set to reach their final expirations based on current allowable forbearance term lengths. This could lead to significant movement in volumes entering early October.

The previous three months were revised up, combined. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in August 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 740,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.
New home sales are now declining year-over-year since sales soared following the first few months of the pandemic.
The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply.
The months of supply increased in August to 6.1 months from 6.0 months in July. 
The all time record high was 12.1 months of supply in January 2009.  The all time record low was 3.5 months, most recently in October 2020.
This is above the normal range (about 4 to 6 months supply is normal).
"The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of August was 378,000.  This represents a supply of 6.1 months at the current sales rate."
The last graph shows sales NSA (monthly sales, not seasonally adjusted annual rate).
In August 2021 (red column), 62 thousand new homes were sold (NSA).  Last year, 81 thousand homes were sold in August.
The all time high for August was 110 thousand in 2005, and the all time low for August was 23 thousand in 2010.
This was above expectations of 714 thousand SAAR and sales in the three previous months were revised up, combined.  I'll have more later today.]]></summary>

문재인 정부의 경제정책 5년을 돌아보고 새로운 시대의 개혁을 부르짖는 책이 출간되었다. 이 책은 변화하는 한국사회에 발맞추어 ‘경제정책의 개혁’이 선행되어야 한다고 주장한다. 과거의 관념과 유산을 털어버리고, 새로운 시대에 맞도록 경제정책의 관점과 인식을 대전환해야 한다고 힘주어 말한다. 

책은 성장담론을 시작으로 부동산, 교육, 재정, 복지, 의료, 저출생, 외교, 환경에 이르기까지 한국사회 곳곳에 현미경을 들이댄다. 정교한 분석과 날카로운 문제의식을 무기로 각각의 정책이 어떻게 추진되었으며, 무엇이 문제였는지 샅샅이 살핀다. 나아가 대안을 제시하는 시도 또한 잊지 않는다. 성장에서 성숙으로 넘어가야 하는 지금, 우리 앞에 찾아온 《정책의 시간》이다.

KUDOS to the residents of the 12 states that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: Vermont at 69.1%, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland. New Jersey, Washington, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire and Oregon at 60.2%.

The following 20 states and D.C. have between 50% and 59.9% fully vaccinated: Virginia at 59.8%, District of Columbia, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Hawaii, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, South Dakota, Kentucky, Arizona, Kansas, Texas, Nevada, and Utah at 50.0%.

Next up (total population, fully vaccinated according to CDC) are Ohio at 49.8%, Alaska at 49.7%, North Carolina 49.0% and Montana at 48.1%.

이제는 "인공지능이 어떤 일을 할 수 있을까?"라는 질문에서 "인공지능이 도대체 할 수 없는 일은 무엇인가?"라는 자조 섞인 질문으로 바뀌었다. 대부분의 전문가는 앞으로 5년 이내에 모든 기술 데이터와 인프라가 AI 기반으로 바뀔 것이라고 말한다. 2010년 전후 모바일에 적응한 기업과 그렇지 못한 기업을 구분했던 것처럼, 모든 제품과 서비스는 AI 기술을 제대로 활용하느냐, 못하느냐로 구분되는 시기가 도래했다.

AI 기술과 비즈니스에 대한 이해 없이는 미래를 준비할 수 없는 이유다. 이 책은 AI의 역사에서 시작하여 핵심 기술과 비즈니스, AI의 창의성과 공정성, 그리고 인간과의 상호작용까지를 폭넓게 다루고 있다. 또한 단순한 트렌드 분석을 넘어 신기술 분야 투자에 대한 통찰과 기술 스타트업의 관점까지를 모두 다루고 있어 AI에 관심이 있는 초보자에서부터 AI 관련 조직에서 일하는 구성원 모두에게 유용하다. 또한 글로벌 AI 전문가들과의 생생한 인터뷰는 이 책의 가치를 더한다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.

From CoStar: STR: US Hotels Achieve Four-Week Occupancy High
U.S. hotel occupancy reached a four-week high, according to STR‘s latest data through September 18.
September 12-18, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 63.0% (-11.6%)
• verage daily rate (ADR): $131.04 (-2.6%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $82.50 (-13.9%)
The gain in occupancy was helped by weekly group demand eclipsing 1 million for the first time since the earliest days of the pandemic. More group demand created a lowering effect on ADR, as group rooms for upper-tier classes are typically priced lower than transient rooms.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months had decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel - usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.]]></summary>

Here are the projections.  In June, most participants expected around two rate hikes in 2023.  Now, about half of participants expect one rates hike in 2022. 
Wall Street forecasts were for GDP to increase at a 8.6% annual rate in Q2 (came in at 6.6%) and forecasts for Q3 have been downgraded recently.  

So GDP was revised down for 2021.

With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the NAR: Existing-Home Sales Recede 2.0% in August
Existing-home sales retreated in August, breaking two straight months of increases, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Each of the four major U.S. regions experienced declines on both a month-over-month and a year-over-year perspective.
  
Total existing-home sales, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, fell 2.0% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.88 million in August. Year-over-year, sales dropped 1.5% from a year ago (5.97 million in August 2020).
...
Total housing inventory at the end of August totaled 1.29 million units, down 1.5% from July's supply and down 13.4% from one year ago (1.49 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, unchanged from July but down from 3.0 months in August 2020.

This graph shows existing home sales, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) basis since 1993. 
Sales in August (5.88 million SAAR) were down 2.0% from last month, and were 1.5% below the August 2020 sales rate.
The second graph shows nationwide inventory for existing homes.
According to the NAR, inventory decreased to 1.29 million in August from 1.31 million in July.

Headline inventory is not seasonally adjusted, and inventory usually decreases to the seasonal lows in December and January, and peaks in mid-to-late summer.
The last graph shows the year-over-year (YoY) change in reported existing home inventory and months-of-supply. Since inventory is not seasonally adjusted, it really helps to look at the YoY change. Note: Months-of-supply is based on the seasonally adjusted sales and not seasonally adjusted inventory.
 Inventory was down 13.4% year-over-year in August compared to August 2020. 
Months of supply was unchanged at 2.6 months in August from 2.6 months in July.
  This was slightly above the consensus forecast. I'll have more later.]]></summary>

메타버스에서 요즘 화두는 디지털 가상 경제에 관한 것이다. 메타버스 이커머스로 가장 공격적인 기업으로 페이스북을 비롯해 국내 기업으로는 ‘제페토’의 네이버와 ‘이프랜드’의 SKT가 꼽힌다. SK mySUNI 부사장인 저자는 메타버스 최일선에서 터득한 메타버스의 진면목, 특히 NFT, 디파이(Defi)같은 메타버스 가상 경제의 큰 틀을 이루는 블록체인 기술에 대해서 알기 쉽게 설명할 뿐 아니라 메타버스가 가져올 시대 변화, 이에 따른 준비 등을 점검하도록 한다. 

이 책 타이틀의 ‘3번째 세상’이란 2000년 웹, 2010년 모바일, 2020년 메타버스로 이어지는 10년 주기의 디지털 산업의 큰 플랫폼의 흐름을 의미한다. 저자는 2000년대의 웹이 콘텐츠, 미디어, 커머스 산업에 위기를 가져왔고, 2010년대의 모바일이 통신, 교통, 배달 산업에 영향을 준 것처럼 2020년대의 메타버스는 또 어떤 변화를 가져올지, 그것을 위기로 만드느냐 기회로 삼느냐는 전적으로 우리의 준비에 달려 있다고 강조한다. 

또 저자는 “메타버스를 차원이 다른 세상이라고 보는 이유는 첫째, 기존 PC나 스마트폰이 보여주지 못한 입체감과 전혀 다른 경험을 제공한다는 것과 둘째, 오프라인 현실과 통합된 디지털의 경험을 제시하고 있다는 것”이라고 말한다. 또 ‘제3세상’이라는 표현도 사용하는데 “제1의 세상은…]]></summary>

채 2년도 되지 않은 기간에 우리는 이전에는 상상할 수 없었던 변화를 목격하고 있다. 어느 날 갑자기 등장한 코로나 바이러스는 개인과 기업, 시장과 사회 등 모든 분야의 추세(trend line)를 10년씩 앞당기고 있으며, 무엇보다 이러한 변화의 속도는 앞으로 점점 더 빨라질 것으로 보인다. 피할 수도, 벗어날 수도 없는 ‘거대한 가속’이 강타한 세상은 팬데믹 이후 어떤 식으로 펼쳐질 것인가? 

세계 최고의 비즈니스 스쿨 교수로 꼽히는 스콧 갤러웨이 뉴욕대 교수는 ‘비즈니스 판도, 교육 시장, 정부의 역할’이라는 3가지 키워드로 미래를 지배할 새로운 패러다임을 설득력 있게 분석한다. 팬데믹으로 양극화된 자본시장에서 더욱 강력해진 플랫폼 제국 ‘빅 4’의 다음 행보는 무엇일까? 이들에 맞서 도전하는 시장 교란자들은 누구인가? 거리 두기로 촉발된 대규모 원격 교육은 교육 시장에 어떠한 위험과 기회를 가져다줄까? 나날이 쌓여가는 자본과 혁신 속에 사회가 새롭게 주목하는 가치는 무엇이 될까? 

대변혁은 이미 시작되었고 막연히 상상했던 미래는 이미 눈앞에 다가와 있다. 살아남고, 소멸하고, 변화하는 속도가 더욱 빨라지는 시대, 이 책은 변곡점에 선 세상과 새로운 기회를 한 발 앞서 읽어낼 서슬 퍼런 인사이트를 선보인다.

교육의 질을 좌우할 결정적 요소 
기술은 규모를 키우고, 규모는 수익을 늘린다 
‘마이크로 세대’는 무엇을 선택할 것인가 

5장 | 거대한 가속이 우리에게 남긴 것들

변화하는 자본주의, 충돌하는 가치 
팬데믹을 낳은 미국의 ‘예외주의’ 
전대미문의 자본시장 상승은 무엇을 가져왔는가 
엄청난 번영에도 발전이 없는 사회 
길은 갈수록 좁아지고 있다 
혁신 경제에서 착취 경제로 
때로는 정부가 놀라울 만큼 효과적일 수 있다 
우리는 무엇을 할 수 있을까 

감사의 글

코딩 인터뷰는 어색한 공간, 낯선 면접관 앞에서 이루어진다. 후회 없이 인터뷰를 마치려면 평소에 난이도와 주제별로 다양한 문제를 풀며 철저히 준비해 두어야 한다. 이 책은 면접관으로 수많은 인터뷰를 해 온 저자들이 집필한 소프트웨어 개발 인터뷰의 종합 안내서다.

자료구조, 탐색, 정렬, 알고리즘 설계 원칙 및 동시성 등에 관련된 문제를 장별로 제시한다. 각 장은 먼저, 문제를 풀기 위해 꼭 알고 있어야 할 내용, 중요한 라이브러리 함수 등을 설명한다. 그 후 실전처럼 문제를 분석하고 답을 내고 코드를 보여 준다. 해당 문제에 대한 설명이 끝나면 비슷한 응용 문제를 제시해 배운 내용을 한 번 더 단단히 할 수 있다.

2021년 대한민국은 2020년에 이어 코로나19 팬데믹의 타격으로 휘청거릴 수밖에 없었다. 2020년이 유례없는 역병의 발생에 허둥지둥하며 대응책 마련에 바빴다면, 2021년은 확진자가 늘고 사회적 거리두기가 강화되면서 자영 업계의 손실과 시민들의 피로감이 극에 달했다. 동시에 하반기에 들어서며 백신 접종률이 늘어나 ‘위드 코로나(With Corona)’, 즉 코로나19 바이러스와의 공존을 모색하려는 기대감이 커진 것도 사실이다.

설령 2022년 위드 코로나 정책이 잘 자리 잡아 경제와 산업이 다시 정상화된다고 하더라도 그것이 코로나19 이전으로의 복귀를 의미하지는 않을 것이다. 많은 것이 이미 달라졌고, 앞으로 그 변화는 오히려 더 요동칠 것이다. 하지만 늘 그랬듯, 삶은 어떻게든 방법을 찾아내기 마련이다.

그렇다면 이러한 격변에 우리는 어떻게 대응할 것인가? 용맹하고 거침없는 호랑이의 기세가 기대되는 2022년, 『트렌드 코리아 2022』은 반전의 시작을 알리는 변화의 징후들을 포착하는 데 결정적인 도움을 줄 것이다.

기술의 도약적 발전, 코로나 팬데믹 등 새로운 변화가 기존의 질서를 파괴하며 비즈니스 환경을 끊임없이 바꾸고 있다. 많은 사람이 경쟁을 넘어 새로운 기술을 빠르게 익히지 못하거나 변화에 적응하지 못하는 기업들은 밀려오는 변화의 물결에서 도태될 것이라고 입을 모아 말한다.

이런 상황에 발 맞춰 전 세계 기업들은 디지털 전환에 앞장서고 있다. 세계경제포럼(WEF)의 발표에 따르면 디지털 기반 플랫폼 기업이 지난 10년간 글로벌 GDP 중 신규 부가가치의 70%를 창출했다고 한다. 

디지털 전환의 선두주자인 맥킨지앤드컴퍼니에서는 전 세계 기업들의 디지털 전환은 “피할 수 없는 흐름”이라고 말하며, 전 세계 글로벌 그룹의 디지털화를 이끌어온 경험을 통해 디지털 전환을 꿈꾸는 기업의 리더들이 꼭 알아야 할 실행 전략들을 신간 《초속도(Fast Times) :디지털 전환 불변의 법칙》를 통해 제시하고 있다.

광복 이후 2019년까지 한국적이고 현대적인 통화와 금융제도가 어떻게 형성되고 발전되어 왔으며 정책적으로 어떻게 활용되었는가를 다룬다. 광복 이후 경제적 혼란 속에서 한국적인 통화 및 금융제도가 왜 어떻게 형성되었으며, 경제개발 시대에 왜 어떻게 재편되고 통제되면서 활용되었으며, 금융자유화 시대에는 이 제도가 왜 어떻게 자율화되고 개방되었으며, 그 결과는 무엇이었는가도 살펴보고 있다.

이어 통화·금융위기가 나타나고 금융과 기업이 재편되면서 어떤 변화가 있는가를 살펴보고, 마지막으로 통화·금융의 장기적 추이 분석을 통해 한국의 통화 및 금융제도의 변화를 수량적으로 제시하고 있다. 특히 이 책은 통화제도, 은행, 개발·저축·투자·보험기관 등 비은행 금융기관, 단기 금융시장과 증권시장, 그리고 통화·금융정책 등 통화·금융 전반의 변화에 주목하고 있다.

지금껏 박종훈이 예측한 경제는 전부 들어맞았다. 수많은 베스트셀러를 출간해 대한민국 경제 흐름을 예측했던 그가 이번에는 『부의 시그널』을 통해 불황 이후 찾아올 세계 경제 패러다임 속 5가지 경제 시그널을 주목한다.

이미 유튜브 채널 「박종훈의 경제한방」에서 친절하고 재미있는 설명으로 많은 사람들이 경제에 친근해질 수 있도록 도왔던 저자는 이번 책에서는 더욱더 친절하고 쉬운 설명으로 독자들에게 다가간다. 『부의 시그널』은 돈과 관련한 다양한 역사적 사건과 경제 흐름을 재미있는 일러스트로 담아내 전작들과 차별화를 두었다. 

놀라운 혁신은 이미 과거로부터 날아왔다. 우리가 돈의 흐름에 주목해야 하는 이유는 분명하다. 반복되어왔던 돈의 흐름 속에서 부의 시그널을 발견할 수 있다면, 미래의 위기 속에서도 내 자산을 지키고 부를 손에 넣을 수 있다. 

변화가 커질수록 부의 기회 역시 커질 수밖에 없다. 새로운 기회는 끝없이 찾아오지만, 그 해답을 알기 위해선 스스로 준비해야만 한다. 흥미로운 이야기를 따라가다 보면 세계 경제의 흐름과 앞으로 한국 경제의 전망까지 꿰뚫어 볼 수 있다. 지금, 부의 시그널을 포착해 미래의 부를 향해 나아가자.

백악관과 미 의회가 설치한 인공지능국가안보위원회 NSCAI가 3년만에 보고서(2021년 3월)를 발표했다. 이 책은 최종보고서(두차례 중간보고서 발표)를 번역, 편집한 것이다. 보고서는 미국과 중국의 첨단 인공지능 기술의 현황 및 장단점을 분석하고, 미국의 향후 행동방향까지 제시해 놓았다.

쿼드, 파이브 아이즈 가입 문제를 비롯, 국제 디지털민주주의 이니셔티브, 반도체 동맹, 우주개발 참여 등 한국 관련 부분도 상당량 기술되어 있다(56~57쪽, 96쪽 ). 지난 5월 중순 백악관에서 문재인 대통령과 조 바이든 대통령의 정상회담에 올려진 반도체 관련 의제도 이 보고서의 지침에 따른 것이다. 향후 미국의 동맹국 정책도 이 지침에 기반해 이뤄질 것이다.

향후 미국은 이 보고서를 토대로 미국은 인공지능 선진 국가로 미국을 혁신할 것이며, 중국 역시 인공지능 개발 프로젝트를 국가적 시활을 걸고 밀어붙히고 있다. 이번 번역된 백악관 AI 리포트는 미중 두 나라의 전략과 더불어 한국을 비롯한 선진 각국이 따라할 인공지능 전략을 망라하고 있다. 

FAANG(페이스북, 아마존, 애플, 넷플릭스, 구글)은 물론, BAT(바이두, 알리바바, 텐센트 등
오늘날 대표적인 글로벌 IT 기술 분야 공룡 기업들은 AI 혁명에 올인하고 있다. 아마존의 CEO 제프 베이조스가 말했듯이, 인류는 현재 AI의 황금시대를 시작하려한다. AI는 미래 경제성장과 국가안보에 직결되는 첨단 기술이 되고 있다.

팬데믹 이후 세계는 각종 품귀 현상에 꾸준히 시달리고 있다. 마스크를 구매하기 위해 긴 줄을 선 사람들은 물론, 소독제와 화장지 등 공산품에 대한 품귀현상이 있었고, 원재료가 없어 반도체나 자동차 공장이 셧다운을 맞기도 했다. 최근에는 어떤 백신을 얼마나 수급할 것인지가 모두의 관심사이다. 이전의 많은 팬데믹도 마찬가지지만, 코로나19는 특히 우리 모두가 서로에게 의존하고 있음을 증명해주었다. 한 사람은, 나아가 하나의 기업과 국가는 결코 독단적으로 생존할 수 없다.

현 MIT 교수인 요시 셰피는 서플라이 체인 분야의 세계적 석학이자 선구자이다. 특히 서플라이 체인에 대한 학술적 전문성과 함께 직접 기업을 운영해온 실무적인 지식을 더한 경력을 바탕으로 회복탄력성(리질리언스)을 강조하며 기업의 유연한 대처를 강조왔다. 이 책에는 불확실하고 예측할 수 없는 포스트 팬데믹 시대를 기회로 전환한 세계 기업의 사례가 설명되어 있다.

앞으로도 새로운 팬데믹의 발생이나 정치적 불안정, 기후 변화 및 자원 고갈 등 수많은 문제가 기업의 생존을 위협할 가능성은 높다. 그러나 이 책이 제시하는 프레임워크와 여러 사례가 다음에 닥칠 위기에 맞서 번창하는 데 도움을 줄 것이다.

PHP나 프로그래밍의 기초를 배우고자 하는 초보자용으로, 문장보다는 이미지를 전면에 내세워 설명하고 있다. 캐릭터 베이스의 프로그램을 작성함으로써 PHP의 개념의 확실한 이해 도모를 목적으로 하고 있다. 그리고 일러스트와 그림을 많이 사용하고 있으므로 단순히 문장으로만 설명하는 것보다 이미지 전달이 더 정확할 것이다.

2017년 한국은 이미 1인당 국민소득 3만 달러를 넘었지만 이후 횡보하고 있다. 저성장의 고착화가 그 배경이다. 저자들은 저성장과 일자리 부족의 원인을 직업 간 과도한 보상격차와 비싼 부동산가격으로 인한 고비용구조로 일목요연하게 설명한다. 그리고 지속 성장과 일자리 창출을 위한 중요 과제를 구체적으로 제시한다. 정책의 실현 가능성을 높이기 위한 방안도 적시하고 있다.

부동산 불패의 신화는 언제까지 계속될 것인가? 문재인 정부는 출범 초기부터 부동산시장 안정화를 최우선 과제 중 하나로 내세워 여러 대책을 쏟아냈지만 그때마다 이를 비웃기라도 하듯 부동산가격은 오히려 급등하기만 했다. 열심히 돈 모아 집을 산다는 예전 식의 내 집 마련은 그야말로 꿈이 되어버렸고, 정부의 약속대로 ‘사는 것’이 아닌 ‘사는 곳’을 바랐던 서민들의 박탈감은 그만큼 더욱 커져만 가고 있다. 

그런데 아이러니한 것은 무주택자뿐만 아니라 집값 폭등으로 큰 이득을 본 1주택자도, 다주택자도 이 상황이 만족스럽지 않다는 것이다. 집 없는 사람은 집을 사기는커녕 빌려 사는 것조차 녹록지 않아 난리고, 집 있는 사람은 시세 차익 환수에 따른 세금 부담으로 난리다. 또 하나의 아이러니는 부동산과 관련한 각종 통계 지표와 국민들의 체감 현실 사이에 상당한 괴리가 있다는 것이다. 

대표적인 국제 주택시장 비교 사이트인 ‘글로벌 프로퍼티 가이드’와 OECD 등의 가격 변동 통계에 따르면, 우리나라의 집값 상승률은 평균적으로 다른 나라들보다 낮은 편이다. 특히 OECD 국가 중에서는 일본과 함께 하위권을 형성하고 있다. 물론 비교 기준의 문제로 논란이 있긴 하지만, 단지 ‘통계의 함정’으로만 치부할 수는 없는 노릇이다. 이를 어떻게 보아야 할까? 좀 더 거시적이고 냉철한 비교 연구가 요구되는 시점이다.

국토 면적으로는 우리의 96배, 인구로는 27배나 되는, 중국이라는 거대한 나라를 한눈에 이해하기란 매우 어렵다. 특히나 지역 간 발전 격차가 큰 탓에 자칫하면 평균의 함정에 빠질 수밖에 없다. 중국 경제를 제대로 알기 위해 반드시 지역별 연구가 뒷받침되어야 하는 이유다. 

이런 관점에서 놀라운 성장을 거듭해온 광둥성은 중국 경제의 현재와 미래를 가늠하는 데 최적의 지역이라 할 수 있다. 실제로 광둥성은 중국 대외개방 역사의 중심지로 적극적인 개혁개방 정책과 수출 전략으로 중국 내에서 32년간 GDP 1위를 차지해왔으며, 광둥성 언론들은 곧 한국의 GDP를 추월할 것이라고 장담하고 있다.

이 책은 중국 산업과 기술의 혁신 현황을 가장 빠르게 보여주는 광둥성을 자세히 들여다보며 중국의 경쟁력이 어디에서 비롯되고 있는지를 밝히고자 한다. 특히 광저우에서 선전을 거쳐 홍콩으로 이어지는 지역을 ‘차이나 실리콘밸리’라고 이름 붙이고, 직접 찾아가 보고 들은 중국 4차 산업혁명의 현장을 담고 있다.   
사실 한국에서 중국에 대한 관심은 베이징과 상하이를 넘지 못하는 경우가 많다. 이 책은 중국 경제의 바로미터라 할 수 있는 광둥성 경제를 3년간 가장 가까이서, 가장 깊게 들여다볼 수 있었던 경험을 통해 베이징과 상하이라는 좁은 시각에서 벗어나 진짜 중국 경제의 현재와 미래를 묻고 있…]]></summary>

현재 전 세계에서 가장 영향력 있는 대표적 경제학자 중 한 명인 폴 크루그먼은, 국내 일반 독자들에게도 낯설지 않다. 1997년 발생한 아시아 외환위기를 사전에 예측하면서 국내에 널리 알려지게 되었고,  <뉴욕타임스>의 고정 칼럼니스트로서 현실 경제 문제에 대한 예리한 진단과 함께 정부 정책에 대한 날선 비판을 하는 그는, 스스로를 ‘현대적 진보주의자’로 부르며 현실 문제에 적극 발언하는 실천적 지식인이다. 크루그먼은 재화와 노동시장의 불안정성을 전제하며 정부 당국의 일정한 개입을 정당화하는 신케인즈주의자로 분류되고 있다.

크루그먼의 책은 국내에 20여 종 번역되어 있으나 정작 그가 어떤 성과를 인정받아 2008년 노벨 경제학상을 받았는지에 대해서는 국내에 잘 알려지지 않았다. 그의 이론이 규모의 경제와 소비자 선호의 다양성을 바탕으로 무역의 패턴과 경제활동의 지리적 분포를 설명하였다는 게 당시 수상의 이유였고, 그것이 이 책 《폴 크루그먼의 지리경제학》의 주제이다.

매일 같은 일상을 살다 보면 자신도 모르게 삶의 테두리가 줄어든다. 만나는 사람만 만나고 다니는 곳만 다니는데 심지어 유튜브 알고리즘조차 끝없이 비슷한 주제의 영상들만 추천한다. 학교에 다닐 때는 원하지 않아도 다양한 분야의 지식을 접했지만 성인이 된 후에는 관심사의 범위를 넓히기가 쉽지 않다. 그러다 보니 생각의 크기 또한 협소해지는 것이 당연하다. 

‘지금의 교양’ 시리즈는 일상적으로 사용하지만 정확한 의미를 알기 어려웠던 각 분야의 50가지 키워드를 선정해 간결하고 정확하게 설명함으로써 세부적인 것에서 출발해 전체를 보는 눈을 길러준다. 50개 키워드 하나하나가 모여 큰 틀의 지도가 완성된다. 낱낱의 지식을 쌓고 생각의 외연을 확장함으로써 지금 이 시대 내 삶에 꼭 필요한 교양을 쌓도록 돕는다.   

‘지금의 교양’ 시리즈 첫 책은 『당신이 꼭 알아야 할 자본주의 키워드 50』이다. 런던 킹스칼리지의 경제학과 교수이자 경제 전문가 조너선 포티스가 자본주의를 구성하는 50가지 핵심 키워드를 통해 자본주의란 무엇이며, 어떻게 그 안에서 사회, 문화, 역사가 촘촘하게 연결되고 발전해왔는지를 설명한다. 자본주의는 오늘날 세계 대부분 국가의 경제 체제이며 이미 우리 사회 곳곳에 스며들어 있다. 세금, 최저임금, 실업, 집값, 대출 같은 일상의 …]]></summary>

지극히 평범한 보통사람 제이(J)가 2022년 한국에서 대통령이 된다는 상상 속의 가정으로부터 이 책은 출발한다. 그런데 여기저기서 ‘빵을 달라’는 외침을 마주하게 된 보통사람 제이(J)는 대한민국 국민들을 먹여 살리기 위해 빵칼을 들고 구체적으로 정부 현안들을 각 부처별로 들여다 보는 이야기이다.

 “델타 대통령의 빵칼”은 총3부로 구성되어 있는데, ‘빵칼을 들기 전에’, ‘빵칼을 들고’ 그리고 ‘빵을 달라’로 되어 있다. 모두가 본능적으로 느끼지만 말로 잘 표현하지 못하는 영역까지 이 책은 절제력을 가진 가운데 거침없이 들어간다. 더하기와 빼기의 정치력을 구체적으로 보여주는 대통령의 빵칼 암호는 델타(Delta)이다. 알파벳 D로 55개 정부 부처의 빵칼 코드를 읽어내는 흥미로움을 준다. 경제전략 정동희 작가의 10번째이자 마지막 책이다.

“중국은 음모, 협작, 기망 등이 지저분하게 판치는 곳이다. 우리가 이를 반칙이라 생각하여 페어플레이를 고수한다면 우리는 그들에게 파트너도 적도 될 수 없다. 옹졸하고 비겁하며 영악한 강자와의 게임에서 우리는 내내 패배하고 있었다.” 저자가 ‘프롤로그’에서 밝힌 중국 비즈니스에 대한 진단이다.

이 책에서 소개하는 40가지의 사례들을 보면 중국 시장이 녹록은커녕 자칫하면 구렁텅이에 빠질 수 있다는 사실을 실감하게 된다. 물론 예전부터 이랬던 것은 아니다. 2006년까지만 해도 중국은 미국과 동일할 정도로 한국인들이 호감을 느끼는 국가였고, 우리에게 아주 친절하고 풍족하며 만만한 시장이었다. 중국인은 우리의 일상생활을 선망하고 대중문화에 열광하던 두껍고 너그러운 지갑의 소유자였다. 이런 상황은 사드발 한한령을 경계로 일변한다. 

이 책은 저자가 직간접적으로 겪은 중국 비즈니스의 다양한 사례로부터 필승 노하우의 핵심을 추려낸 것이다. 중국인과 중국 비즈니스의 민낯을 넘어 본질 그 구석구석까지 파헤쳐놓은 한중 비즈니스의 해부학 교재라고 지칭할 만하다. 

상대를 잘 파악하여 합리성에 기반한 냉철한 이성으로써 사업하는 것과, 무지한 낙관과 우리 사회에서나 통용될 법한 정의감 등의 잣대로 임하는 것은 천양의 차이로 귀결한다. 중국과의 사업에서 결핍해서는 안 될 태도와 필수 지식이 해학, 분노, 감동, 충격 등 흥미진진한 이야기를 통해 전수된다. 이길 수 있는 진짜배기 정보를 현장감 있는 에피소드를 통해 얻을 수 있는 것은 이 책만의 강점이다.

코로나19 이후 증시가 V자 반등을 하면서 주식을 처음 접한 개인투자자들이 많아졌다. 대한민국에 이토록 주식 열풍이 분 적은 없었다. 코인도 마찬가지이다. 현재 서점에서 팔리고 있는 투자 서적은 500여 권. 그런데 주가 조작이 횡행하는 주식시장에서 개인투자자가 실제 도움을 받을 만한 책은 없다. 저자는 아무도 알려주지 않는 작전 세력에 대해 제대로 알려주어, 개인투자자들이 정보의 비대칭을 극복하는 데 도움을 주고자 한다. 

이 책은 투자를 공부할 때 활용하는 PBR, PER과 같은 보조지표를 다루지 않는다. 그런 정보라면 이미 많은 책이 존재한다. 일반인이 합법과 불법 사이를 오가며 줄타기를 하는 작전 세력의 움직임을 알기란 참으로 어렵다. 개인은 자본력도 정보력도 뒤떨어지기 때문이다. 그러나 세력은 흔적을 남긴다. 

이 책은 그 흔적을 하나하나 보여준다. 잘 살피고 속지 말자. 세력의 매집 차트, 작전 세력의 의도, 실행, 결과까지 실증 데이터를 기반으로 전 과정을 파헤친다. 세력의 흔적을 찾아내는 7가지 요소 즉 매집 차트, N자 파동, 작업 세력, 전환사채와 유상증자, 작전 과정 그리고 코인 시장에서의 작전 등으로 정리해 누구나 쉽게 이해하고 적용해 볼 수 있다.

펴내며 
세력을 만나다

코스닥 잡주가 대규모 유상증자하면 99% 작전 
알고 보자-유상증자 공시를 읽자

5. 작전이 시작되다
작전의 주체들
작전 개시

6. 김치 프리미엄이 나타나다
김치 프리미엄은 세력이 개미를 꾀기 위한 유인책
