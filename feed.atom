        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is evidence that physicians disproportionately suffer from substance use disorder and mental health problems.  It is not clear, however, whether these phenomena are causal.  We use data on Dutch medical school applicants to examine the effects of becoming a physician on prescription drug use and the receipt of treatment from a mental health facility.  Leveraging variation from lottery outcomes that determine admission into medical schools, we find that becoming a physician increases the use of antidepressants, opioids, anxiolytics, and sedatives, especially for female physicians. Among female applicants towards the bottom of the GPA distribution, becoming a physician increases the likelihood of receiving treatment from a mental health facility.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, we provide a comprehensive, empirical assessment of the hypothesis that the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) affected hospital readmissions. In doing so, we provide evidence as to the validity of prior empirical approaches used to evaluate the HRRP and we present results from a previously unused approach to study this research question—a regression-kink design. Results of our analysis document that the empirical approaches used in most prior research assessing the efficacy of the HRRP often lack internal validity. Therefore, results from these studies may not be informative about the causal consequences of the HRRP. Results from our regression-kink analysis, which we validate, suggest that the HRRP had little effect on hospital readmissions. This finding contrasts with the results of most prior studies, which report that the HRRP significantly reduced readmissions. Our finding is consistent with conceptual considerations related to the assumptions underlying HRRP penalty; in particular, the difficulty of identifying preventable readmissions, the highly imperfect risk adjustment that affects the penalty determination and the absence of proven tools to reduce readmissions.]]></summary>

We study whether other financial market frictions—in particular, lack of access to a safe place to save—might limit credit's benefits. Working with Kenyan farmers, we cross-randomize access to a simple savings product with a harvest-time loan. Among farmers offered a loan, the additional offer of a savings lockbox increased farm investment by 11% and household consumption by 7%. Results suggest that financial market frictions can interact in important ways and that multifaceted financial access programs might unlock dynamic household gains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While a growing body of evidence documents large gender disparities in health care and related social insurance programs, little is known about what drives these disparities.  We leverage administrative data and random assignment of doctors to patients inherent within the workers’ compensation insurance claim dispute resolution process to study the impact of gender match between doctors and patients on medical evaluations and subsequent social insurance benefits received. Compared to differences among their male patient counterparts, female patients randomly assigned a female doctor rather than a male doctor are 5.0% more likely to be evaluated as disabled and receive 8.5% more subsequent cash benefits on average. There is no analogous gender-match effect for male patients. The magnitude of these effects implies that having female doctors evaluate patients entirely offsets the observed gender gap in the likelihood of being evaluated as disabled when male doctors evaluate patients. We explore mechanisms through further analysis of the administrative data and complementary survey evidence. In addition, we present broader evidence on gender gaps in workers' compensation insurance and gender homophily in patients' selections of doctors in settings where patients have choice. Combining this evidence, we conduct policy counterfactuals illustrating how policies increasing gender diversity among doctors or increasing gender homophily in patient-doctor matches may impact gender gaps in evaluated disability. Our findings indicate that policies increasing the share of female patients evaluated by female doctors may substantially shrink gender gaps in medical evaluations and associated outcomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We evaluate how nonresponse affects conclusions drawn from survey data and consider how researchers can reliably test and correct for nonresponse bias. To do so, we examine a survey on labor market conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic that used randomly assigned financial incentives to encourage participation. We link the survey data to administrative data sources, allowing us to observe a ground truth for participants and nonparticipants. We find evidence of large nonresponse bias, even after correcting for observable differences between participants and nonparticipants. We apply a range of existing methods that account for nonresponse bias due to unobserved differences, including worst-case bounds, bounds that incorporate monotonicity assumptions, and approaches based on parametric and nonparametric selection models. These methods produce bounds (or point estimates) that are either too wide to be useful or far from the ground truth. We show how these shortcomings can be addressed by modeling how nonparticipation can be both active (declining to participate) and passive (not seeing the survey invitation). The model makes use of variation from the randomly assigned financial incentives, as well as the timing of reminder emails. Applying the model to our data produces bounds (or point estimates) that are narrower and closer to the ground truth than the other methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented policy responses and a large literature evaluating their impacts. This paper re-examines this literature and investigates the role of researchers' degrees-of-flexibility on the estimated effects of mobility-reducing policies on social-distancing behavior. We find that two-way fixed effects estimates are not robust to minor changes in usually-unexplored dimensions of the degree-of-flexibility space. While standard robustness tests based on the sequential addition of covariates are very stable, small changes in the outcome variable and its transformation lead to large and sometimes contradictory changes in the estimates, where the same policy can be found to significantly increase or decrease mobility. Yet, due to the large number of degrees-of-flexibility, one can focus on a set of results that appears stable, while ignoring problematic ones. We show that recently developed heterogeneity-robust difference-in-differences estimators only partially mitigate these issues, and discuss how a strategy of identifying the point at which a sequence of ever more-stringent robustness tests eventually fail could increase the credibility of policy evaluations.]]></summary>

Our statistic incorporates life expectancy, consumption, leisure, and inequality, with mortality rates playing a key role quantitatively. According to our estimates, welfare for Black Americans was 43% of that for White Americans in 1984 and rose to 60% by 2019. Going back further in time (albeit with more limited data), the gap was even larger, with Black welfare equal to just 28% of White welfare in 1940. On the one hand, there has been remarkable progress for Black Americans: the level of their consumption-equivalent welfare increased by a factor of 28 between 1940 and 2019, when aggregate consumption per person rose a more modest 5-fold. On the other hand, despite this remarkable progress, the welfare gap in 2019 remains disconcertingly large. Mortality from COVID-19 has temporarily reversed a decade of progress, lowering Black welfare by 17% while reducing White welfare by 10%.]]></summary>

We deliberately did not modify the model specification in view of the COVID-19 outbreak, except for the exclusion of crisis observations from the estimation sample. We compare the MF-VAR forecasts to the median forecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the productivity-pay relationship in the United States and Canada along two dimensions. The first is divergence: the degree to which the levels of productivity and pay have diverged. The second is delinkage: the degree to which incremental increases in the rate of productivity growth translate into incremental increases in the rate of growth of pay, holding all else equal. We show that in both countries the pay of typical workers has diverged substantially from average labor productivity over recent decades, driven by both rising labor income inequality and a declining labor share of income. Even as the levels of productivity and pay have grown further apart, we find evidence for some linkage between productivity and pay in both countries: a one percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth is associated with a positive increase in the rate of pay growth, holding all else equal. This linkage appears stronger in the US than in Canada. Overall, our findings lead us to tentatively conclude that policies or trends which lead to incremental increases in productivity growth, particularly in large relatively closed economies like the USA, will tend to raise middle class incomes. At the same time, other factors orthogonal to productivity growth have been driving productivity and typical pay further apart, emphasizing that much of the evolution in middle class living standards will depend on measures bearing on relative incomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. entrepreneurial finance market has changed dramatically over the last two decades. Entrepreneurs raising their first round of venture capital retain 30% more equity in their firm and are more likely to control their board of directors. Late-stage startups are raising larger amounts of capital in the private markets from a growing pool of traditional and new investors. These private market changes have coincided with a sharp decline in the number of firms going public—and when firms do go public, they are older and have raised more private capital. To understand these facts, we provide a systematic description of the differences between private and public firms. Next, we review several regulatory, technological, and competitive changes affecting both startups and investors that help explain how the trade-offs between going public and staying private have changed. We conclude by listing several open research questions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Racial segregation can occur across educational programs or classrooms within a given school, and there has been particular concern that gifted & talented programs may reduce integration within schools. This paper evaluates the contribution of gifted & talented education to racial segregation using data on the presence and racial composition of gifted & talented programs at virtually all US elementary schools over a span of nine school years. I first show that, consistent with widespread perceptions, gifted & talented programs do disproportionately enroll white and Asian students while Black, Hispanic and Native American students are underrepresented. However, I also show that accounting for the within-school racial sorting caused by these programs has little or no effect on standard measures of overall racial segregation. This is primarily because gifted & talented programs are a small share of total enrollments and do enroll non-negligible numbers of under-represented minority students. I also estimate changes in race-specific enrollments after schools initiate or discontinue gifted & talented programs, and find no significant enrollment changes after programs are eliminated or initiated. I conclude that gifted & talented education is a quantitatively small contributor to racial segregation in US elementary schools.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose an approach to modeling and estimating discrete choice demand that allows for a large number of zero sale observations, rich unobserved heterogeneity, and endogenous prices. We do so by modeling small market sizes through Poisson arrivals. Each of these arriving consumers then solves a standard discrete choice problem. We present a Bayesian IV estimation approach that addresses sampling error in product shares and scales well to rich data environments. The data requirements are traditional market-level data and measures of consumer search intensity. After presenting simulation studies, we consider an empirical application of air travel demand where product-level sales are sparse. We find considerable variation in demand over time. Periods of peak demand feature both larger market sizes and consumers with higher willingness to pay. This amplifies cyclicality. However, observed frequent price and capacity adjustments offset some of this compounding effect.]]></summary>

Student achievement depends on cognitive ability, motivation, effort, and match of school curriculum to ability. Exercising charter school autonomy over curriculum, to maximize achievement gains, the charter sets curriculum to attract the highest ability students. Achievement gains are modest, consistent with empirical evidence. We next investigate a no-excuses charter that not only chooses curriculum but also enforces an effort minimum. Consistent with the evidence, highly motivated students select into the charter, achievement gains are large, and the largest gains accrue to those who would be lower performers in public school.]]></summary>

In this paper we provide estimates of the standard of living by commuting zone for households in a given income or education group, and we study how they relate to local cost of living. Using a novel dataset, we observe debit and credit card transactions, check and ACH payments, and cash withdrawals of 5% of US households in 2014 and use it to measure mean consumption expenditures by commuting zone and income group. To measure local prices, we build income-specific consumer price indices by commuting zone. We uncover vast geographical differences in material standard of living for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This data is as of December 7th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearance Plan Exits Drop Significantly
Active forbearance plan totals plunged in the first full week of December, led by portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans fell by 112,000 (-11%) this week, led by a 49,000 (-15%) drop in PLS/portfolio loans. FHA/VA plan volumes dropped 42,000 (-12%) followed by GSE (21,000/-7%). There is a modest opportunity for additional improvement in coming weeks with 33,000 loans still listed with November reviews for extension/removal (roughly half of which are expected to be reaching their final expirations).
As of December 7, 882,000 mortgage holders (1.7%) remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, including 1.1% of GSE, 2.6% of FHA/VA and 2.1% of portfolio/PLS.
  Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Overall, the number of forbearance plans is down by 177,000 (-17%) from the same time last month, with the potential for modest additional improvements through the end of the year. Plan starts over the past four weeks are up 24% from the preceding four-week period, driven by a more than 40% increase among FHA/VA loans (with GSEs seeing a 29% increase). This is a trend we’ll be watching closely as we round out the year.

Excerpt:

...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 15.8% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 25.0% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 23.3% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.8 percent in November on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.9 percent in October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 6.8 percent before seasonal adjustment.
The monthly all items seasonally adjusted increase was the result of broad increases in most component indexes, similar to last month. The indexes for gasoline, shelter, food, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles were among the larger contributors. The energy index rose 3.5 percent in November as the gasoline index increased 6.1 percent and the other major energy component indexes also rose. The food index increased 0.7 percent as the index for food at home rose 0.8 percent. 
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.5 percent in Novemberfollowing a 0.6-percent increase in October. Along with shelter, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles, the indexes for household furnishings and operations, apparel, and airline fares were among those that increased. The indexes for motor vehicle insurance, recreation, and communication all declined in November.
 The all items index rose 6.8 percent for the 12 months ending October, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1982. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.9 percent over the last 12 months, while the energy index rose 33.3 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 6.1 percent. These changes are the largest 12-month increases in at least 13 years in the respective series.

현재 뜨겁게 논쟁이 일고 있는 메타버스에 대한 전반적인 이해를 넘어서 산업 생태계, 관리, 경제학, 기반시설 등 여러 각도에서 생각해 봐야 할 관점을 보여 준다. 저자들은 과거 디지털 경제를 연구하면서 깨달은 바에 과학 기술 분야의 가장 놀랄 만한 변혁을 결합해 향후 발전 방향의 윤곽을 정리했다.

문제는 인류가 앞으로 살아갈 이 디지털 신세계에서는 과거 전통 경제에서 당연하다고 여겨졌던 기본 원칙들이 모두 통하지 않는다는 것이다. 더구나 이 책의 서문을 쓴 이더리움의 창시자 비탈릭 부테린은 메타버스의 디지털 자산 규모가 머지않아 현실 세계의 자산 규모를 넘어설 것이라고 예언한다.

메타버스는 단순한 경제가 아니라 ‘사회’이며 더욱이 M세대(메타버스 세대)가 만든 포스트모던 사회다. 메타버스에는 경제 현상은 물론이고 문화 현상과 사회 현상도 있다. 국가, 민족, 지역, 시간의 경계를 초월한 이 사회는 어떤 문명을 만들어낼까? 이 책은 도래할 메타버스 시대를 준비하고 기회를 포착하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

블록체인이란 거래정보가 중앙 서버에 집중되지 않고, 네트워크의 여러 컴퓨터에 분산해서 저장되는 것을 말한다. 블록체인 기술에 주목하는 이유는 저렴한 비용으로 투명하고 안전한 전자금융거래가 가능해질 것이라는 기대감 때문이다. 비용 측면에서도 블록체인은 기술의 특성상 막대한 비용절감 효과를 기대할 수 있기에 금융권과 공공서비스 부문의 블록체인 도입은 더욱 활발해질 전망이다.

Excerpt: 
In Q3 2021, mortgage debt increased $230 billion, the largest quarterly increase since 2006.
...
 For Q3 2021, the Net Equity Extraction was $147 billion, or 3.24% of Disposable Personal Income (DPI).   The last two quarters have shown a sharp increase in equity extraction compared to recent years, but the level is nothing like the amount of equity extraction during the housing bubble as a percent of DPI. During the housing bubble we saw several quarters with MEW above 8% of DPI.
...
The bottom line is the recent increase in MEW is not concerning - it is far less as a percent of disposable personal income than during the bubble, and most homeowners have substantial equity.]]></summary>

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Occupancy Hovers Around Mid-50%
U.S. hotel occupancy increased from the previous week, but performance comparisons with 2019 were lower, according to STR‘s latest data through December 4.
November 28 through December 4, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 54.8% (-8.8%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $127.92 (-0.5%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $70.08 (-9.2%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Although down compared to 2019, the 4-week average of the occupancy rate is close to the median rate for the previous 20 years (Blue).


Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The occupancy rate will now decline seasonally into the new year.]]></summary>

CoreLogic® ...  today released the Homeowner Equity Report for the third quarter of 2021. The report shows U.S. homeowners with mortgages (which account for roughly 63% of all properties) have seen their equity increase by 31.1% year over year, representing a collective equity gain of over $3.2 trillion, and an average gain of $56,700 per borrower, since the third quarter of 2020.
This summer, home price growth reached the highest level in more than 45 years, pushing equity gains to another record high and allowing 70,000 properties to regain equity in the third quarter of 2021. These equity gains provided a crucial barrier against foreclosure for the 1.2 million borrowers who reached the end of fo…]]></summary>

This is an article from housing economist Tom Lawler (this is important for understanding demographics):
Based on provisional CDC data on US births and deaths, and using a reasonable “guesstimate” on Net International Migration based on available immigration data, it appears as if the US resident population from 7/1/2020 to 7/1/2021 grew by just 486,290, or 0.15%.  That growth would be the lowest in over a century.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the NMHC: NMHC Rent Payment Tracker Finds 77.1 Percent of Apartment Households Paid Rent as of December 6
The National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC)’s Rent Payment Tracker found 77.1 percent of apartment households made a full or partial rent payment by December 6 in its survey of 11.8 million units of professionally managed apartment units across the country.
This is a 1.7 percentage point increase from the share who paid rent through December 6, 2020 and compares to 83.2 percent that had been paid by December 6, 2019. This data encompasses a wide variety of market-rate rental properties across the United States, which can vary by size, type and average rental price.
The NMHC Rent Payment Tracker metric provides insight into changes in resident rent payment behavior over the course of each month, and, as the dataset ages, between months. While the tracker is intended to serve as an indicator of resident financial challenges, it is also intended to track the recovery as well, including the effectiveness of government stimulus and subsidies.

This graph from the NMHC Rent Payment Tracker shows the percent of household making full or partial rent payments by the 6th of the month compared to 2019 and to the first COVID year. 

Although payments are down from 2019, rent payments are up from last year.
This is mostly for large, professionally managed properties.
The second graph shows full month payments through November compared to the same month the prior year.

For November, rent payments were down compared to November 2019 and 2020.

Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spike in layoffs and discharges in March 2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings increased in October to 11.033 million from 10.602 million in September.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 61% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 24% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (See light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for "quits").]]></summary>

20세기 가장 위대한 경제학자, 케인스. 그는 경제 이론과 경제 정책에 있어 위대한 지적 혁명을 촉발시켰다. 이 책은 수학 방정식 등을 최소화하면서, 대학교 학부학생, 열린 마음을 가지고 있는 기존 강단 경제학자, 공무원 그리고 일반 경제인 등 다양한 계층의 독자 모두가 쉽게 케인스의 경제 사상을 이해할 수 있도록 설명하고 있다.

이 책은 케인스 이론의 핵심적인 개념들, 즉 시장경제에 있어서 불확실성, 균형의 의미, 화폐의 역할, 그리고 유효수요의 원칙을 설명함으로써, 이러한 핵심 개념을 철저히 무시하고 있는 기존 주류 경제학과 그 안에서의 자칭 케인지언들이 가지는 오류를 지적하고 있다.

또한 그에 비추어 현대 경제에 있어서 다양한 논쟁점들, 즉 고용과 실업의 문제, 재정과 금융 정책, 국제수지 문제 등에 대한 케인스적인 해결 방안을 시사하고 있다. 특히 그러한 논의들을 역사적 배경(베르사유조약부터 브레턴우즈 체제까지)과 연결시키고, 또한 케인스의 경제 이론이 현재의 유로존 문제에 어떤 해결점을 제시할 수 있는지도 검토한다.

지금 우리가 처한 세계를 이해하는 가장 적합한 키워드가 있다면 그것은 ‘불평등’이다. 토마 피케티는 지난 몇십 년 동안 전 세계적으로 소득과 부의 불평등이 증가했다고 말한다. 그의 책 『21세기 자본』이 촉발한 불평등이라는 주제는 경제뿐 아니라 정치, 사회적으로 경각심을 일으키고 커다란 영향을 끼쳤다. 

경제학자 이정우는 피케티의 첫 책과 함께 최근작 『자본과 이데올로기』와 여러 저명한 경제학자가 함께 쓴 『세계불평등보고서 2018』을 통해 피케티가 정확히 어떤 진단을 내리고 있는지 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 불평등 문제를 해소하기 위해 피케티가 제시한 사회국가, 누진소득세, 세계자본세 그리고 참여사회주의와 참여연방주의 등의 처방에 대해서도 살펴본다. 

저자가 피케티의 책을 안내하는 이유는 한국 사회의 불평등을 바로 보고, 그에 따른 대안을 제안하고자 하는 데 있다. 한국은 소득 불평등, 정규직과 비정규직의 양극화, 부동산으로 인한 자산 불평등이 유독 심각하다. 저자는 이 문제의 해결 없이는 한국 경제의 지속적인 발전과 선진국 진입은 어렵다고 말한다. 나아가 한국이 처한 현실을 냉정하게 드러내 보여주고, 더 나은 세상으로 바꿔나가기 위한 다양한 해법들을 제시하고 있다.

The Dodge Momentum Index fell 4% in November to 171.7 (2000=100) — down from the revised October reading of 178.1. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Construction Network, is a monthly measure of the initial report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year. In November, commercial planning fell 8% while institutional planning moved 5% higher.
The value of nonresidential building projects continues to move in a sawtooth pattern, alternating between a month of gains followed by a loss. Since the pandemic began, nonresidential building projects entering planning have been more volatile than in past cycles, likely driven by increased challenges from higher prices and lack of labor.
Despite these issues and a lack of underlying demand for some building types such as offices and hotels, the Momentum Index remains near a 14-year high. Compared to November 2020, the Momentum Index was 44% higher in November 2021. The commercial planning component was 45% higher, and institutional was 41% higher.

This graph shows the Dodge Momentum Index since 2002. The index was at 171.7 in November, down from 178.1 in October.
According to Dodge, this index leads "construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year".  This index suggested a decline in Commercial Real Estate construction through most of 2021, but a pickup towards the end of the year, and growth in 2022.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
Denver, Las Vegas, Northwest (Seattle), and San Diego
  
From Denver Metro Association of Realtors® (DMAR): DMAR Real Estate Market Trends Report
From October to November, the market saw a staggering 33.41 percent decrease in month-end active inventory, dropping to 2,248. Throughout the entire Denver Metro area, there are currently only 1,444 single-family detached properties and 804 attached properties to buy.
Over the past five years, month-end active inventory dropped between 23.36 percent in 2016 and 27.92 percent in 2019. Theoretically, if inventory stayed the course and dropped 25 percent this year, the market would end the year at 1,686 active properties leading into 2022, which is drastically lower than the end of 2020 and would lead to the most competitive year yet. With 2,248 active listings on the market and that number expected to go down by the end of the month, expectations are set that 2022 will be a wild and competitive ride.
emphasis added 
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 27.2% in November MoM from October, and down 36.3% YoY.
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these four markets were down 33% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes: This CoreLogic House Price Index report is for October.  The recent Case-Shiller index release was for September.  The CoreLogic HPI is a three month weighted average and is not seasonally adjusted (NSA).
From CoreLogic: US Annual Home Price Growth at a Record 18% in October, CoreLogic Reports
CoreLogic® ... today released the CoreLogic Home Price Index (HPI™) and HPI Forecast™ for October 2021.
U.S. annual home price growth remained strong at 18% in October, the highest recorded in the 45-year history of the index. Nonetheless, monthly price growth has slowed from its April peak and signals a moderation in price growth that the CoreLogic HPI Forecast projects will continue to slow in coming months.
Despite affordability challenges, a recent CoreLogic consumer survey shows that over half of respondents across every age cohort said that owning a home has always been a goal of theirs — further supporting the outlook that consumer desire for homeownership remains.
“New household formation, investor purchases and pandemic-related factors driving demand for the limited supply of available for-sale homes continues to propel the upward spiral of U.S. home prices,” said Frank Martell, president and CEO of CoreLogic. “However, we expect home price growth to moderate over the near term as many buyers take a break for the holidays.”
...
 Nationally, home prices increased 18% in October 2021, compared to October 2020. On a month-over-month basis, home prices increased by 1.3% compared to September 2021.
...
Home price gains are projected to slow to a 2.5% increase by October 2022 as affordability and economic concerns deter some potential buyers and additional for-sale inventory becomes available.
  
"Single-family detached houses remain the preferred home for buyers during the pandemic,” said Dr. Frank Nothaft, chief economist at CoreLogic. “This is reflected in the 19.5% annual price rise for detached houses, which marks another record-high for the CoreLogic Home Price Index.”

Mortgage rates have been in a very narrow, sideways range since October.  During that time, the average 30yr fixed rate hasn't moved by more than an eighth of a percent in either direction.  Today was no exception.
 ...
These so-called mid-day reprices can happen in either direction.  It didn't look like we would see any today based on market movement in the first 90 minutes.  After that, bond began to deteriorate, ultimately forcing lenders to issue negative reprices.  Keep in mind that we're dealing with very small adjustments in the bigger picture.  The point is that rates are now slightly higher than they were on Friday afternoon. [30 year fixed 3.22%]

IMPORTANT: For "herd immunity" most experts believe we need 70% to 85% of the total population fully vaccinated (or already had COVID).  Note: COVID will probably stay endemic (at least for some time).


KUDOS to the residents of the 5 states that have achieved 70% of total population fully vaccinated: Vermont at 74.0%, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts at 72.2%.


KUDOS also to the residents of the 16 states and D.C. that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: New York at 69.2%, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Virginia, New Hampshire, Oregon, District of Columbia, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Illinois, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, and Wisconsin at 60.2%.

The following 19 states have between 50% and 59.9% fully vaccinated: Pennsylvania at 59.3%, Nebraska, Iowa, Utah, Michigan, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Nevada, South Dakota, North Carolina, Alaska, Ohio, Kentucky, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri and Indiana at 51.0%.

Next up (total population, fully vaccinated according to CDC) are Tennessee at 49.8%, Arkansas at 49.8%, Georgia at 49.4%, Louisiana at 49.2%, North Dakota at 49.2%, and West Virginia at 49.2%.

TensorFlow와 sklearn을 사용해 금융이나 경제 맥락에 인공지능을 접목하는 방법론을 설명한다. 먼저 경제학이 추구하는 지향점과 머신러닝의 특징과 장점을 비교해 같은 점과 다른 점을 분석한 다음 양 측면에서 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 방대한 참고문헌과 함께 설명한다. 기초적인 회귀에서 출발해 결정 트리와 랜덤 포레스트를 살펴보고 이미지 처리와 자연어 처리가 금융 맥락에서 어떻게 활발하게 활용되고 있는지 설명한다. 특히 자연어 처리 부분이 금융 맥락과 접목되는 지점은 다양한 실습과 예제를 통해 손쉽게 이해하도록 돕는다.

금융 데이터의 특징인 시계열 데이터는 RNN과 LSTM를 활용해 설명한다. 또한 생성적 모델을 적용하는 방법과 이론적 모델 부분도 다룬다. 각 장은 모두 예제와 코드를 지원하며 이를 통해 각 상황을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 기초를 제공한다. 책에서 제공하는 방대한 참고문헌은 금융 맥락에서 인공지능을 접목하려던 수많은 학자의 발자취를 살펴볼 귀중한 자료다.

“수신료의 가치를 증명한 명품 다큐” 등 시청자들의 뜨거운 호평을 받은 2021년 화제의 다큐멘터리 〈팬데믹 머니〉가 책으로 만들어졌다. 2차 세계대전 이후 최악의 실물경제와 최대 호황을 맞이한 자산 시장이 교차하는 이 모순된 현실은 왜 발생하는 걸까? 

그 답을 구하기 위해 〈팬데믹 머니〉 제작진은 제러미 리프킨, 제이슨 솅커, 오건영, 박종훈 등 국내외 최고 경제 전문가들을 만나 달러라는 기축통화가 작동하는 방식부터 어마어마하게 풀린 돈이 거품과 부채를 만들고 결국 경제 위기를 불러일으키는 과정을 깊이 있게 추적한다.

특히 『팬데믹 머니: 감염된 경제, 풀린 돈의 역습에 대비하라』는 방송에서 미처 다 보여주지 못한 전문가들과의 대담을 수록했다. 또한 2022년 달라질 경제 환경과 자산 시장에 대해 통화정책 전문가 김진일 고려대 교수와 금융 전문가 오건영 신한은행 부부장과 이야기를 나눴다.

금리와 환율만 알면 경제 공부 다했다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 금리와 환율에는 국내외 경제 상황이 총체적으로 반영되어 있기 때문이다. 금리와 환율이 주가에 미치는 영향이나 상관관계에 따른 책은 많으나, 금리와 환율에만 초점을 맞추며 경제를 풀어내는 책은 찾기 어렵다. 그래서 ‘거시경제의 거장’이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 『금리와 환율 알고 갑시다』를 통해 어렵고 복잡한 경제이론과 시장의 상황을 낱낱이 분석하여 자신만의 철학으로 쉽게 명쾌하게 풀어낸다. 

지금 우리에게 필요한 것은 단순 금리와 환율의 개념이 아니다. 금리와 환율을 통해 현재의 경제 상황을 이해하고, 미래를 내다볼 수 있는 통찰력을 갖추어 조금 더 명확하게 경제의 흐름을 파악하는 안목이다. 그 깊이 있는 안목은 금리 인상(하락), 환율 변동, 집값 상승(하락) 등의 위기에도 올바른 판단과 실행을 이룰 수 있게 도와줄 것이다.

프롤로그: 금리와 환율 알고 갑시다

제1부 금리 알고 갑시다
금리란 무엇일까요?
• 금리의 기원은 신용에 있습니다
• 경제학 교과서에서는 현재의 소비를 참는 데에 대한 대가를 금리라 합니다
한국은행의 통화정책 수단, 기준금리
• 한국은행의 기준금리는 모든 금리의 기준입니다
• 기준금리는 한국은행 금융통화위원회에서 결정합니다
• 통화정책방향 결정문과 의사록은 꼭 보아야 합니다
• 비둘기파와 매파의 구분은 이렇습니다
• 한국은행은 기준금리를 왜 올리고 내릴까요?
• 기준금리는 어떻게 물가에 영향을 주나요?
• 미국의 기준금리는 연방기금금리 입니다
• 적정 기준금리 수준을 결정하는 하나의 방법이 테일러준칙이라 합니다
금리인상이 가계와 자영업자에 미치는 영향
• 금리인상으로 가계 이자부담금액이 늘어나게 되었습니다
• 금리인상으로 자영업자 부담도 더 늘어납니다
• 금리가 오르면 가계 전체적으로는 이익입니다
단리와 복리
• 저축은 복리로 해야 합니다
• 72법칙을 알아야 합니다
• 중국이 미국 GDP에 접근해가는 것도 복리의 마법에 있습니다
금리와 채권 가격은 역관계
• 금리가 오르면 채권 가격은 떨어집니다
• 채권의 수요와 공급에 따라 가격과 금리가 결정됩니다
• 금리 하락기에 채권투자를 해야 합니다
금리로 미래의 경제를 예측 — 금리의 기간구조 
• 수익률 곡선은 채권만기에 따른 수익률을 연결한 선입니다
• 장단기 금리차이가 선행지수에 앞서갑니다
• 장단기 금리차로 미래의 경제성장률도 예상해볼 수 있습니다
• 장단기 금리차이 역전은 경기침체를 예고합니다
금리로 금융시장 안정성 판단 — 금리의 위험구조
• 금융시장이 불안하면 위험 프리미엄이 확대됩니다
통화와 금리의 관계 
• 통화 공급이 늘어나면 유동성 효과로 금리가 떨어집니다
• 소득효과와 피셔효과로 금리는 다시 상승합니다
예금금리와 대출금리
• 가중평균금리를 보면 금리 추이를 알 수 있습니다
• 한국은행연합회에서 예금과 대출금리를 비교해줍니다
• 첫째, 대출금리가 어떻게 결정되는 건가요?
• 둘째, 대출금리의 종류는 어떤 것들이 있나요?
• 셋째...

지난 2,000년 사이에 지구의 온도는 1도 정도를 오르내리는 선에서 안정적으로 유지되었다. 덕분에 인류는 살아남아 번영을 구가했고 전 세계 인구는 70억까지 늘어났다. 그러나 지금의 세계는 지구온난화로 인한 기상이변으로 돌이킬 수 없는 타격을 입고 있다. 경제적 측면에서도 위기의 상황에 접어들었다. 

이에 저자는 지금 당장 국가, 기업이 탄소 중심의 경제 체제에서 벗어나 재생에너지, 전기자동차 등 저탄소 경제 체제로 변화하지 않으면 미래는 없다고 단언하고 이미 기후위기를 기회로 만드는 국가와 기업들의 사례를 통해 우리에게 나아가야 할 방향을 제시한다.

CEO의 관상을 분석해 회사의 위험도, 투자수익률, 경영 스타일을 한눈에 알 수 있다고 말하는 괴짜 교수가 있다. 바로 닥터 파이낸스, 성균관대 김영한 교수다. 김 교수는 일명 ‘AI 신언서판’ CEO의 얼굴을 연구해 세계적인 재무, 회계학 탑 저널에 논문을 올렸고, 미국 블룸버그 TV와 PBS에도 출연해 화제가 되었다. 《부자, 관상, 기술》은 전 세계 재무, 경영학계를 깜짝 놀라게 한 김영한 교수의 최신 연구를 쉽고 재미있게 소개한 최초의 책이다.

존 엘킹턴 지음, 정윤미 옮김 / 더난출판사 / 2021년 12월 / ISBN:9788984054202
정가: 17,000원 / 판매가: 15,300원 / 마일리지: 72원
이벤트: 화제의 책+알라딘 사은품(이벤트 도서 포함, 국내도서 4만원 이상)




회복과 재생을 촉진하는 새로운 미래 자본주의 모델 안내서 《그린 스완》이 출간됐다. 그린 스완은 지난 2007년 뉴욕대학교 교수 나심 니콜라스 탈레브가 제시한 용어 ‘블랙 스완’에서 파생했다. 블랙 스완은 가능성이 극히 적지만, 일단 발생하면 돌이킬 수 없을 정도의 엄청난 충격을 주는 사건을 말한다. 9.11 테러나 2008년 세계 금융위기가 그 대표적인 예다. 그린 스완은 ‘해결책’을 더한, ‘자본시장의 변화를 촉진하는 개념’으로 지속가능성 측면에서 새롭게 정의한 미래 자본주의 모델이라고 할 수 있다. 

이 책은 이미 시작된 ‘변화의 징후’를 읽는 10가지 용어인 목적, 비즈니스 모델, 수익, 성장, 가치, 임팩트, 책임, 중대성, 지배구조, 좌초자산을 통해 세계 경제의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있음을 확인한다. 기업에서 전례가 없는 엄청난 사안에 직면하게 될 때, 종종 ‘사악한 문제’가 발생한다. 예를 들면 담배 회사는 흡연이 수많은 질병을 일으킨다는 것을 알면서도 그 문제를 은폐해왔고, 결국 거대한 액수의 벌금을 선고받아야 했다.

저자가 지적하는 사악한 문제는 크게 다섯 가지다. 플라스틱 쓰레기로 오염된 바다, 살인자 칼로리, 항생제가 초래한 슈퍼버그, 탄소가 급격히 기온을 상승시킨 것, 심각하게 증가한 우주 쓰레기다. 책에서는 이를 해결하기 위한 다섯 가지 패러다임을 짚어내고, 그린 스완의 특성을 지닌 자본주의와 민주주의 그리고 지속가능성을 제시한다. 저자는 세계 기업들에 다음과 같이 엄중하게 윤리성을 촉구한다.

‘공정한 보상’의 저자 신재용 교수는 ‘MZ세대에게 ‘공정’이란 노력에 대한 정당한 대가를 의미하는 매우 실용적인 개념’이라고 말한다. 부도 신분도 대물림되는, 별다른 출구가 없는 이 세대가 살아남기 위해 강조하는 레토릭(rhetoric)이 바로 ‘공정’인 것이다. 

MZ세대는 ‘교환(exchange)’이라는 틀로 세상을 본다. 신재용 교수는 이 책에서 화이트칼라 MZ세대의 특수한 성장배경을 분석하며, 학창시절부터 통과의례처럼 거듭한 토너먼트 경쟁 끝에 현재의 직장에 자리한 이들에게 ‘투입한 노력에 상응하는 대가’를 받는 공정한 교환관계를 유지하는 것이야말로 자신을 지키는 일임을 밝힌다.

01 왜 지금 공정한 보상인가?
공정이 최고의 가치다: 공정성에 민감한 MZ세대의 등장
화이트칼라 MZ세대가 생각하는 공정은 다르다
화이트칼라 MZ세대는 왜 공정한 보상에 더 민감한가?
MZ세대의 토너먼트 연대기
더 이상 비밀은 없다-MZ세대의 소속기반 커뮤니티
왜 갑자기 지금? 최근의 성과급 논란
SK하이닉스 성과급 논란: 이천 쌀집에서는 무슨 일이 있었나?
EVA=영업이익-세금-자본비용

02 무엇이 공정한 보상인가?
보상을 보는 두 가지 이론
기본급 결정을 위한 세 가지 실무
한국기업의 성과급: 인재의 영입, 유지, 동기부여의 도구인가?
한국의 MZ세대 직장인들은 보상을 공정하다고 생각할까?
보상은 무엇에 근거해야 하는가?
공정과 “운”의 필터링
글로벌 기업 CEO 보상을 둘러싼 논쟁
[더 알아보기1] 암젠(Amgen)의 CEO 성과보상 사례
[더 알아보기2] 사회적 가치 혹은 사회성과에 근거한 보상
[더 알아보기3] 넷플릭스 드라마 ‘오징어 게임’에서 나오는 게임들 중 가장 공정한 게임은?

03 성과에 근거한 보상: 성과측정과 인센티브 설계
성과목표는 왜 필요할까?
성과지표의 선정
성과-보상 간 민감도 결정

04 임직원 보상격차
우리 사장님은 얼마 받고 일하실까?
나도 언젠가 그 자리에 올라갈 수 있으니까-토너먼트 이론
임원은 직원의 몇 배를 받아야 할까?
토너먼트 이론과 공정성 이론은 공존할 수 있을까?
중요한 것은 승진가능성!
전무, 상무의 동기부여가 직원보다 더 중요하다

05 어디로 나아갈 것인가? 보다 공정한 보상을 위한 제언
MZ세대의 보상에 대한 요구를 이해하고 제도를 정렬하라
집단을 넘어 개인의 성과로: 역량 있는 관리자의 육성부터 시작하자
평가/보상의 투명성이 중요하다
직급 중심에서 역할 중심으로, 획일적인 보상에서 다양한 보상으로
성장할 수 있는 기회도 보상의 일부다

협동조합기본법 시행 10년, ‘협동조합 2만 개 시대’를 맞아 지나온 역사와 현실 상황을 살피고, 한국의 협동조합은 무엇을 해야 할지 모색하며 새로운 대안으로 ‘협동조합 허브론’을 제시한다.

협동조합 운동의 본질은 협동하려는 인간에 대한 신뢰를 바탕으로 자유롭고 평등한 사회를 만들겠다는 인류의 꿈을 실현하는 것이다. 그러나 갈수록 심해지는 불평등과 인류의 존재 자체를 위협하는 기후 위기 앞에서 그 꿈은 닿을 수 없는 이상에 불과한 것 아닌가 하는 회의의 정서가 짙다. 

책은 그런 참혹한 현실을 직시하면서, 그럼에도 불구하고 협동조합만이 할 수 있는 영역이 분명히 있음을 확인한다. 그것은 협동조합이 작은 협동의 경험들을 이어 큰 협동으로 나아가는 접착제 역할을 하고 사회 곳곳을 협동으로 연결하는 허브가 되는 것이다.

김기태, 강민수 두 저자는 한국 협동조합 운동의 산증인으로, 현장은 물론 협동조합 연구 분야에서도 혁혁한 성과를 보여 주었다. 이제 협동조합 허브론이라는 새로운 운동론을 제안하며 40년 전 레이들로가 ICA(국제협동조합연맹) 모스크바 대회에서 제기한 협동조합의 정체성에서 한 걸음 더 나아갈 것을 촉구한다.

북한과 인접한 해안가에는 파도에 떠밀려 온 북한 생활 쓰레기가 가득하다. 이 지역에서 수거한 북한 생활 쓰레기 제품 포장지는 모두 708종의 1,414점이다. 당과류와 음료류는 물론 식품류와 잡화류 그리고 의약품까지 실로 그 종류가 엄청나다. 

자력갱생을 강조하는 북한에서 어떻게 이리도 다양한 상품을 만들어 내는지 그저 의아할 뿐이었다. 그렇게 하나둘 모은 생활 쓰레기는 북한 사회를 읽는 소중한 자료이자 보물이 되었다. 생활쓰레기 포장지는 북한 제품의 브랜드와 디자인, 생산공장 현황 그리고 정치선전을 엿볼 수 있다. 북한사람들의 흔적이 고스란히 담긴 서해안의 <평양마켓>으로 함께 떠나보자.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[앞으로 100년 : 인류의 미래를 위한 100장의 지도
이언 골딘 외 지음, 권태형 외 옮김 / 동아시아 / 2021년 11월 / ISBN:9788962624045
정가: 32,000원 / 판매가: 28,800원 / 마일리지: 120원
이벤트: 불렛저널 2022 에디션 (대상도서 포함 국내도서 2만원 이상)




옥스퍼드 마틴 스쿨의 창립자이자 세계화 및 국제 개발 분야의 권위자인 이언 골딘과 정치학, 안보학 분야의 석학인 이가라페 연구소의 로버트 머가가 함께 쓴 책이다. 수십 년 간 축적된 연구 및 데이터에 최신의 위성 사진 및 지도 자료를 결합시켰다. 세계화, 기후, 도시화, 불공정, 폭력, 보건, 인구…, 인류가 맞이하고 있는 열네 가지의 중대한 국면을 낱낱이 분석하고 각 현안들을 명쾌한 이미지로 시각화하여 보여준다.

19세기 광고계의 거물이었던 프레드 버나드는 “한 장의 이미지가 천 마디의 말보다 낫다”라는 말을 남겼다. 그 말처럼, 『앞으로 100년』에서 이언 골딘과 로버트 머가가 전하는 메시지는 구체화된 이미지를 통해 사람들에게 가닿는다. 인류가 지구에 어떤 영향을 미치고 있을까? 지금 인류가 지구 위에서 지속 가능한 삶을 꾸려가려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 북극에서 일어나는 화재, 전 세계에서 동시다발적으로 일어나는 해수면의 상승, 이민자에 대한 사람들의 편견과 그 이면의 진실…. 

이 모두를 단순한 말이 아니라 구체적인 이미지로 전달한다. 다양한 방식으로 제작된 100장을 훌쩍 넘어서는 지도와 인포그래픽은 압축적이면서도 설명적이다. 저자들은 때로는 우리의 직관에 어긋나기도 하는 세계의 단면을 냉철하게 제시한다. 그러면서도 그 목소리에는 호소력이 있다. 왜냐면 그들에게는 인류가 맞이한 문제와 앞으로 나아가야 할 방향에 대한 명확한 비전이 있기 때문이다.

저자들이 제시하는 것은 이 지구 위에서 인류가 살아남고, 지속 가능한 삶을 살기 위한 거대한 로드맵이다. 이 책은 인류가 미지의 땅을 헤쳐나가기 위해 집어들어야 할 필수적인 생존 가이드북이다.

모바일과 인터넷을 삶에서 결코 떼어낼 수 없는 젊은 세대이든, 종이 신문이 오히려 익숙한 ‘올드 제너레이션’이든, 하루도 빠짐없이 맞닥뜨리게 되는 언어들이 있다. 많은 이들이 그저 고개를 갸우뚱할 뿐 또렷하게 이해하지 못 하는, 그렇다고 딱히 물어볼 데도 없고 네이버로 검색을 해봐도 속 시원하게 개념이 정리되지도 않아 어정쩡한 채로 머릿속을 맴도는, 저 숱한 경제용어들이 바로 그 언어다. 싹 무시해버릴 수도 없고 그렇다고 들러붙어 공부하기도 쉽지 않은 이 용어들은 대체로 몇 개의 타입으로 나뉜다. 

이해하기 난감한 최신 경제용어 160개를 선정해 제목처럼 ‘명쾌하고 야무지게’ 해설한 책을 독자들에게 제시한다. 단순한 개념 정의는 말할 것도 없거니와, 그 용어가 생겨난 배경이나 경제 환경, 그 용어가 우리의 일상생활, 직장생활, 그리고 투자 활동에 미치게 될 영향이나 충격, 해설을 한층 더 생생하게 만들어주는 실제 기업이나 인물들의 사례, 좀 더 수월한 이해를 도와줄 이미지와 도표와 차트 및 통계치, 향후 경제의 흐름을 어느 정도 예측할 수 있게 도와주는 전문가들의 조언에 이르기까지. 

이 책 한 권이면 골치 아팠던 핵심 경제용어들이 또렷이 이해되어 친하게 다가올 뿐 아니라, 마지막 장을 덮을 때쯤이면 누구나 ‘나름 경제전문가’의 경지에 이를 수 있을 것이다. 물론 현명하고 민첩한 재테크 기술의 습득은 짜릿한 보너스다.

중앙일보 경제부 기자들과 함께 ‘금융 SOS’를 연재하고 있는 경제 기자가 쓴 책이다. 누구나 한 번쯤은 가족간 돈거래, 부동산, 빚, 기타 금융사고 등으로 인해 어려움을 겪는다. 하지만 금융 관련 직종 종사자나 전공자가 아니고서야 인터넷을 구석구석 뒤진다 해도 해결책을 찾기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니다. 

이 책은 그런 어려움을 겪는 이들에게 상비약이 되어줄 유용한 경제지침서이다. 저자는 흔히 벌어지는 각종 금융 사건·사고의 다양한 실제 사례를 직접 취재하고, 변호사와 금융 전문가들의 자문을 받아 그에 대한 ‘해결책’을 찾는 데 초점을 맞추었다.

일반 독자들에게 단순히 ‘어떻게 하면 돈을 잘 모을 수 있는지’와 같은 경제와 금융 관련 정보를 전달하는 데 그치는 것이 아니라, 금융에 대해 잘 알지 못하는 일반 사람들, 특히 금융 사각지대에 놓인 이들에게 실질적인 도움을 주기 위해 쓰였다. 개인 혼자 해결하기 어려운 금융문제의 대처법을 일목요연하게 정리했다.

지은이의 말_일상 속 ‘돈’ 문제로 힘들 때 가정 상비약이 되어줄게요

1장 가족간 돈 거래는 남보다 더 ‘깐깐하게’
부모에게 돈을 빌렸다면 ‘연 4.6% 이자’를 납부해야
“고생했어. 이 집은 당신 줄게” 남편의 말로 한 증여, 통할까? 
“며느리야, 이혼하면 상가는 안 준다” 이혼계약서 쓰는 부자들
“집 줄게, 효도해라” 효도도 계약서 쓰는 시대 
형제간 재산싸움을 막으려면 부모의 유언장이 필수
떠난 딸 몫을 원하는 사위, 한푼도 주기 싫은 장인의 방어책은? 
7배 폭등한 남편의 비트코인, 이혼 때 남편이 “산 적 없다” 잡아떼면?
현금자산이 10억을 넘으면 ‘육십분’ 전략을 쓰자
평생 일군 회사, ‘가업’ 승계도 전략이 필요하다

2장 돈 쓰는 지혜를 알아야 돈이 모인다
피트니스센터 이용권 결제 시 먹튀에 대비해 영수증을 챙기자
통신사·신용카드 포인트를 1원도 허투루 버리지 않는 법
코로나19와 아시아나 M&A, ‘내 마일리지’는 어쩌죠?
‘앗, 택시에 서류가방을’ 신용카드로 분실물 찾는 방법은?
주차장 붙박이 운전자와 초보 운전자를 위한 자동차보험은?
1년에 한두 번 병원 찾는데 4세대 실손보험으로 갈아탈까?
자녀 학비 마련 위해 예금 대신 삼성전자 주식 사준다
불황에 더 빛나는 예물 재테크, 순금 목걸이와 팔찌 세트 어때요?
13월의 월급을 챙기는 연말정산 4가지 전략

3장 내 인생의 최대 숙제인 ‘집’
전세계약이 2년 더 연장될까? 만약 집주인이 거주하겠다고 하면?
전세 낀 집을 살 때는 ‘세입자 계약 만료 시점’을 꼭 확인해야
육아문제로 부모와 집을 합치면 1주택자 비과세 혜택을 못 받나?
20대 자녀 명의로 집을 샀다면 1주택자로 취득세를 내야 할까?
개인회생을 신청해도 주택 압류를 막을 수 있다 
형제가 집을 ‘반반’씩 사이좋게 상속받으면 세금폭탄 
절세 알아보다가 이혼, 갈라서면 정말 세금 줄어들까? 
신혼부부 특공과 생애 최초 특공 중 무주택 신혼부부에게 유리한 것은? 
부부 공동명의인 아파트 한 채 은퇴자, 단독명의로 바꿔야 할까?

4장 ‘빚’의 굴레에서 벗어나 ‘빛’ 보는 법
내가 상속포기를 하면, 내 자식이 그 빚을 물려받는다

파이썬을 마스터할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 연습이다. 숫자 맞히기 게임, 16진수 출력하기와 같은 간단한 문제부터 판매세 계산하기, 순환하는 이터레이터 만들기와 같은 궁금한 문제들까지 프로그래밍 실력을 키워 줄 엄선된 50가지 연습 문제를 담았다. 

먼저 어떤 내용을 다룰지 알아보고, 문제를 제시한 후, 해답과 함께 풀어보며, 어떻게 동작하는지 그리고 추가로 어떤 부분을 고민해볼지도 설명한다. 새로운 문제에 도전할 때마다 프로그래밍 기술과 자신감을 키울 수 있을 것이다. 또한, 이렇게 배운 내용들은 자신의 프로젝트에 적용해볼 수도 있다. 파이썬을 배운 후 어떻게 실력을 키울지 막막하다면 이 책으로 시작해보자.
