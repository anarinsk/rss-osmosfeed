        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The impacts of environmental change on human outcomes often depend on local exposures and behavioral responses that are challenging to observe with traditional administrative or sensor data. We show how data from private pollution sensors, cell phones, social media posts, and internet search activity yield new insights on exposures and behavioral responses during large wildfire smoke events across the US, a rapidly-growing environmental stressor. Health-protective behavior, mobility, and sentiment all respond to increasing ambient wildfire smoke concentrations, but responses differ by income.  Indoor pollution monitors provide starkly different estimates of likely personal exposure during smoke events than would be inferred from traditional ambient outdoor sensors, with similar outdoor pollution levels generating >20x differences in average indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Our results suggest that the current policy reliance on self protection to mitigate health risks in the face of rising smoke exposure will result in modest and unequal benefits.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using a new survey of firms’ inflation expectations in France, we provide novel evidence about the measurement and formation of inflation expectations on the part of firms. First, French firms report inflation expectations with a smaller, but still positive, bias than households and display less disagreement. Second, we characterize the extent and manner in which the wording of questions matters for the measurement of firms’ inflation expectations. Third, we document whether and how the position of the respondent within the firm affects the provided responses. Fourth, because our survey measures firms’ expectations about aggregate and firm-level wage growth along with their inflation expectations, we are able to show that expectations about wages are even more condensed than firms’ inflation expectations and almost completely uncorrelated with them, indicating that firms perceive little link between price and wage inflation. Finally, an experimental treatment indicates that an exogenous change in firms’ inflation expectations has no effect on their aggregate wage expectations.]]></summary>

The paper does not find robust time-series evidence of polarizing effects alongside either economic growth or population urbanization (including among those below the national median). There was strong co-movement between polarization and inequality. Larger urban-rural gaps in mean incomes are strongly polarizing in China.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper uses administrative tax data to estimate top wealth in the United States. We assemble new data that links people to their sources of capital income and develop new methods to estimate the degree of return heterogeneity within asset classes. Disaggregated fixed income data reveal that rich individuals earn much more of their interest income in higher-yielding forms, and have much greater exposure to credit risk. Consequently, in recent years, the interest rate on fixed income at the top is approximately three times higher than the average. Using firm-level characteristics to value firms, we find that twenty percent of total pass-through business wealth accrues to those with losses. We combine this new data on fixed income and pass-through business returns with refined estimates of C-corporation equity, housing, and pension wealth to deliver new capitalized wealth estimates. Our approach---which builds on Saez and Zucman (2016) and Bricker, Henriques, and Hansen (2018)---reduces bias because wealth and rates of return are correlated. From 1989 to 2016, the top 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% wealth shares increased by 7.6, 5.1, and 3.0 percentage points, respectively, to 31.5%, 15.0%, and 7.0%. While these changes are less dramatic than some prior estimates, wealth is very concentrated: the top 1% holds nearly as much wealth as either the bottom 90% or the "P90-99" class. We discuss implications for income inequality measures, capital tax policy, and savings behavior.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced huge numbers of employers and employees to remote work. How many of these newly remote jobs will go overseas? We offer a rough quantification based on two observations: 1) offshore work is trade in services, and 2) the number of telemigrants is the volume of this trade divided by the average wage. Combining these with gravity-model estimates, we can roughly predict the number of new telemigrants that would arise from lower barriers to trade in services. Telemigration seems unlikely to be transformative when it comes to the development paths of most emerging economies. The baseline service trade flows are modest, and the standard gravity model restricts modest changes to have modest impacts. There are no tipping points in structural gravity models. Finally, we propose a simple model of telemigration in which small changes can have large consequences. The key is to assume that latent comparative advantage takes a different shape than typically assumed in quantitative trade models. Given this, small changes in trade costs can generate large and asymmetric increases in the exports of service tasks from low-wage nations.]]></summary>

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, we document that the children of richer US parents are more likely to select into occupations that rank higher in terms of this index. We rationalize this fact by introducing occupational choice with preferences over the intrinsic qualities of occupations into a standard theory of intergenerational mobility. Estimating the model allows us to infer the equivalent monetary compensation each worker receives from the intrinsic qualities of their chosen occupation. Earnings adjusted to reflect this additional compensation show substantially larger persistence of income from parents to children. Our model further predicts that the trends in the composition of labor demand in the US over the past three decades decreased intergenerational persistence, and also led to higher growth in the welfare of the average worker than that implied by observed earnings.]]></summary>

Using a controlled experiment, with two sessions one week apart, we analyze the dynamic effects of feedback on beliefs about own performance and decision-making across two different domains (verbal skills and math). We find significant gender gaps in beliefs and choices before feedback: men are more optimistic about their performance and more willing to compete than women in both domains, but the gaps are significantly larger in math. Feedback significantly shifts individuals' beliefs and choices. Despite this, we see substantial persistence of gender gaps over time. This is particularly true among the set of individuals who receive negative feedback. We find that, holding fixed performance and decisions before feedback, women update their beliefs and choices more negatively than men do after bad news. Our results highlight the challenges involved in overcoming gender gaps in dynamic settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the private market response to the National School Lunch Program, documenting economically meaningful spillovers to non-recipients. We focus on the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), an expansion of the lunch program under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Under the CEP, participating schools offer free lunch to all students. We leverage both the staggered roll-out and eligibility criterion for the CEP, which is limited to schools where at least 40% of students participate in other means-tested welfare programs. We find that local adoption of the CEP causes households with children to reduce their grocery purchases, leading to a 10% decline in grocery sales at large retail chains. Retailers respond with chain-level price adjustments: chains with the most exposure lower prices by 2.5% across all outlets in the years following adoption, so that the program's welfare benefits propagate spatially. Using a stylized model of grocery demand, we estimate that, by 2016, the indirect benefit had reduced grocery costs for the median household by approximately 4.5%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relationship between the degree of inequality and the demand for redistribution has been a central question in political science and political economy. The famous median-voter model predicts that higher inequality, reflected in a growing gap between the income of the average and the median voter, should lead to increased demand for redistribution, as policymakers cater to the median voter’s preferences (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). Yet, using data from OECD countries, Kenworthy and McCall (2008) show that, despite increases in inequality in those countries, there was no corresponding increase in demand for redistribution. Part of the explanation of this puzzle lies in the realization that it is not only (or even mainly) reality, but perceptions that shape support for policy. This article will explore recent evidence using large-scale social economics surveys and experiments that sheds lights on beliefs about inequality, social mobility, diversity and immigration, social position, and understanding of how policies work.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Handbook chapter seeks to introduce students and researchers of industrial organization (IO) to the field of market design. We emphasize two important points of connection between the IO and market design fields: a focus on market failures—both understanding sources of market failure and analyzing how to fix them—and an appreciation of institutional detail. 
Section II reviews theory, focusing on introducing the theory of matching and assignment mechanisms to a broad audience. It introduces a novel “taxonomy” of market design problems, covers the key mechanisms and their properties, and emphasizes several points of connection to traditional economic theory involving prices and competitive equilibrium. 
Section III reviews structural empirical methods that build on this theory. We describe how to estimate a workhorse random utility model under various data environments, ranging from data on reported preference data such as rank-order lists to data only on observed matches. These methods enable a quantification of trade-offs in designing markets and the effects of new market designs. 
Section IV discusses a wide variety of applications. We organize this discussion into three broad aims of market design research: (i) diagnosing market failures; (ii) evaluating and comparing various market designs; (iii) proposing new, improved designs. A point of emphasis is that theoretical and empirical analysis have been highly complementary in this research.]]></summary>

Falling rates raise the valuation of industry leaders relative to industry followers and this effect snowballs as the interest rate approaches zero. There are multiple channels through which falling rates disproportionately benefit industry leaders: (i) the cost of borrowing falls more for industry leaders, (ii) industry leaders are able to raise more debt, increase leverage, and buyback more shares, and (iii) capital investment and acquisitions increase more for industry leaders. All three of these effects also snowball as the interest rate approaches zero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Health insurance may play an important role not only in immediate access to care but in the management of chronic disease, which would have implications for long-run care needs as well as health outcomes.  Such causal connections are often difficult to establish, but we use Oregon’s 2008 Medicaid lottery to assess the management of diabetes and asthma, as well as several markers of physical health.  This analysis complements several prior studies by introducing new data elements and by analyzing chronically ill subpopulations.  While we had previously found that having insurance increases the diagnosis and use of medication for diabetes, we show here that it does not significantly increase the likelihood of diabetic patients receiving recommended care such as eye exams and regular blood sugar monitoring, nor does it improve the management of patients with asthma.  We also find no effect on measures of physical health including pulse, obesity, or blood markers of chronic inflammation.  Effects of Medicaid on health care utilization appear similar for those with and without pre-lottery diagnoses of chronic physical health conditions.  Thus, while Medicaid is an important determinant of access to care overall, it does not appear that Medicaid alone has detectable effects on the management of several chronic physical health conditions, at least over the first two years in this setting.  However, sample limitations highlight the value of additional research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to their short lifespans and migrating moneyness, options are notoriously difficult to study with the factor models commonly used to analyze the risk-return trade-off in other asset classes. Instrumented principal components analysis solves this problem by tracking contracts in terms of their pricing-relevant characteristics via time-varying latent factor loadings. We find that a model with three latent factors prices the cross-section of option returns and explains more than 85% of the variation in a panel of monthly S&P 500 option returns from 1996 to 2017. In particular, we show that the IPCA factors can be rationalized via an economically plausible three-factor model consisting of a level, slope and skew factor. Finally, out-of-sample trading strategies based on insights from the IPCA model have significant alpha over previously studied option strategies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economic shocks are notoriously difficult to predict but recent research suggests qualitative metrics about economic actors’ expectations are predictive of downturns.  We show consumer expectations indices from both the Conference Board and the University of Michigan predict economic downturns up to 18 months in advance in the United States, both at national and at state-level.  All the recessions since the 1980s have been predicted by at least 10 and sometimes many more point drops in these expectations indices.  A single monthly rise of at least 0.3 percentage points in the unemployment rate also predicts recession, as does two consecutive months of employment rate declines.  The economic situation in 2021 is exceptional, however, since unprecedented direct government intervention in the labor market through furlough-type arrangements has enabled employment rates to recover quickly from the huge downturn in 2020.  However, downward movements in consumer expectations in the last six months suggest the economy in the United States is entering recession now (Autumn 2021) even though employment and wage growth figures suggest otherwise.]]></summary>

From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Occupancy Reaches Highest Level Since Mid-August
U.S. hotel occupancy reached its highest level since mid-August, while room rates dipped from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through October 16.
October 10-16, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 65.0% (-10%)
• verage daily rate (ADR): $134.03 (-1.4%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $87.15 (-11.3%)
Week-over-week demand growth came almost exclusively from the Sunday ahead of Columbus Day. Overall for the three-day holiday weekend (8-10 October), occupancy reached 72% as compared with 75% in 2019.
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The Summer months had decent occupancy with solid leisure travel, and occupancy was only off about 7% in July and August compared to 2019.


Usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.   However, this year, so far, business travel has been lighter than leisure travel in 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Also, incoming port traffic is backed up significantly in the LA area with numerous ships at anchor waiting to unload.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation's container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was down 0.4% in September compared to the rolling 12 months ending in August.   Outbound traffic was down 2.0% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports - and with the backlog of ships, will probably continue strong.
Imports were down 4% YoY in September (recovered last year following the early months of the pandemic), and exports were down 23% YoY.]]></summary>

On prices, the NAR reported:
The median existing-home price for all housing types in September was $352,800, up 13.3% from September 2020 ($311,500), as prices rose in each region.
Median prices are distorted by the mix (repeat sales indexes like Case-Shiller and FHFA are probably better for measuring prices), but this is the fourth consecutive month with a deceleration in the median price.  The NAR reported median prices were up 23.6% YoY in May, 23.4% in June, 17.8% in July, 14.9% in August and 13.3% in September.   This deceleration will probably show up in Case-Shiller and the FHFA indexes very soon.

The graph shows existing home sales by month for 2020 and 2021.
This was the second month this year with sales down year-over-year. This should continue through the rest of the year, since sales averaged 6.7million SAAR over the last three months of 2020.  emphasis added

A majority of Districts indicated positive growth in consumer spending; however, auto sales were widely reported as declining due to low inventory levels and rising prices. Travel and tourism activity varied by District with some seeing continued or strengthening leisure travel while others saw declines that coincided with rises in COVID cases and the…]]></summary>

From the AIA: Demand for design services continues to increase
Architecture firms continue to report increasing demand for design services in September, according to a new report today from The American Institute of Architects (AIA).
The Architecture Billings Index (ABI) score for September was 56.6, which is up from August’s score of 55.6. Any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings from the prior month. During September, scoring for both the new project inquiries and design contracts moderated slightly, but remained in positive territory, posting scores of 61.8 and 54.7 respectively.

The hope was that controlling whether firms could downsize would reduce mass job losses as large British companies left the country post-independence. This column explores the effect of the Industrial Disputes Act on firms of different sizes. The authors find that smaller firms did not see much change, but larger firms did employ fewer contract workers as a result. However, this effect was driven by firms exploiting a loophole, rather than the law itself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million in September, up 5.4% from August’s preliminary pace but down 3.7% from last September’s seasonally adjusted pace
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that the YOY % decline in the inventory of existing homes for sale last month was similar to that in August.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 12.6% from last September.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release September existing home sales on Thursday, October 21, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 6.06 million SAAR. 

Note that the NAR reported median prices were up 23.6% Year-over-year (YoY) in May, 23.4% in June, 17.8% in July and 14.9% in August.  It appears the YoY growth slowed further in September.]]></summary>

Census will release data next year on the length of time from start to completion, and that will probably show long delays in 2021. In 2020, it took an average of 6.8 months from start to completion for single family homes, and 15.4 months for buildings with 2 or more units.
Combined, there are 1.426 million units under construction. This is the most since 1974.

Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,555,000.  This is 1.6 percent below the revised August estimate of 1,580,000, but is 7.4 percent above the September 2020 rate of 1,448,000.  Single‐family housing starts in September were at a rate of 1,080,000; this is virtually unchanged from the revised August figure of 1,080,000. The September rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 467,000.
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,589,000.  This is 7.7 percent below the revised August rate of 1,721,000, but is virtually  unchanged from the September 2020 rate of 1,589,000.

The first graph shows single and multi-family housing starts for the last several years.
Multi-family starts (blue, 2+ units) decreased in September compared to August.   Multi-family starts were up 38% year-over-year in September.
Single-family starts (red) were unchanged in September, and were down 2% year-over-year.   
The second graph shows single and multi-family housing starts since 1968. 
This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and then the eventual recovery (but still not historically high).
Total housing starts in September were below expectations, and starts in July and August were revised down, combined.

이 책에는 방역 당국과 주류언론에서 무시하거나 짓누르는 전문가들의 목소리가 담겨있다. 영문으로 된 논문, 비주류언론기사, 그리고 전문가들이 인터뷰한 내용이 많이 포함되어 있다. 나는 그러한 내용을 분석하고 정리하면서 전문가들의 목소리들이 책에 담길 수 있도록 노력했다.

부동산 시장이 유례없는 대변혁의 시기를 맞고 있다. 코로나 바이러스의 유행으로 경기는 안 좋은데 집값과 전월세는 폭등하고, 상가 건물이 비어가는 와중 꼬마빌딩의 인기는 치솟고 있다. 영끌해서라도 내 집을 마련하려는 사람들, 서울에서 수도권으로 밀려나는 사람들에, 벼락부자가 된 사람들까지 뒤섞여 부동산 시장은 혼돈 그 자체다. 기존의 경험과 상식으로는 이해하기 힘든 상황에 사람들은 그야말로 ‘패닉’에 빠졌다. 

이런 대전환의 시기를 맞아 부동산 업계가 가장 신뢰하는 전문가인 김경민 서울대 교수가 ‘2022년 대한민국 부동산 시장에 대한 완벽한 해설서’를 제시한다. 빅데이터로 예측한 서울시 아파트 가격부터 코로나 이후 떠오를 핫 플레이스와 최신 투자 정보까지, 지금 반드시 주목해야 할 부동산 트렌드에 대해 상세히 분석했다. 저자는 신간 《부동산 트렌드 2022》에서 특히 2022년에는 대선과 지방선거, 금리 인상과 대출 절벽 같은 이슈가 쟁점이 되어 또 한 번 부동산 시장이 요동칠 거라 단언한다.

하버드대학교 부동산·도시계획 연구로 박사 학위를 받은 김경민 서울대 교수는, 수많은 부동산 투자자와 실수요자의 든든한 안내자 역할을 해왔다. 《부동산 트렌드 2022》는 현재 대한민국의 주요한 부동산 이슈를 총망라한 결정판이다. 책에 활용된 데이터 분석기법은 저자가 보스턴 소재 상업용 부동산…]]></summary>

부모처럼 살기 싫지만 부모만큼 되기도 어려운 세대, 밀레니얼. 그들은 ‘이번 생은 망했다’면서도 탈진 직전까지 일에 몰두하고, 필패하도록 설계된 체제에서 ‘졌지만 잘 싸웠다’며 자조한다. 밀레니얼 세대에게 ‘번아웃’은 신드롬이 아니다. 무기력과 불안정은 그들 삶 전반에 깔린 배경음악이자, 그들이 평생을 지내며 살아온 온도다. 

미국 유명 온라인 매체 <버즈피드>에서 700만 조회 수를 기록하며 국내 트위터상에서도 크게 회자한 칼럼 ‘밀레니얼은 어떻게 번아웃 세대가 되었는가’의 저자 앤 헬렌 피터슨은, 번아웃에 휩싸인 밀레니얼에게 결연히 선언한다. “반드시 이렇게 살 필요는 없다.” 더불어 그들이 겪은 실패와 좌절을 시대순으로 면밀히 살피며, 이 문제들이 사실은 예외주의와 능력주의를 기반으로 한 현대 자본주의 체제에서 비롯한 것이라고 분석한다. 아마존, 〈하퍼스 바자〉, 〈뉴욕 타임스〉, 〈에스콰이어〉에서 2020년 화제의 논픽션으로 손꼽힌 책 《요즘 애들》은 열정과 능력을 의심받으면서도 부단히 성실해야 하는 밀레니얼의 악전고투를 가감 없이 담아냈다.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of October 15th, inventory was at 424 thousand (7 day average), compared to 554 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.6%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55% from 936 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 426 thousand, and was down 23.3% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 38% above the record low in early April.


Now inventory may have peaked for the year in early September.   Six weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far), so inventory is currently off about 3.1% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - now well above the level of a year ago - but still below a normal rate for October.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the Fed: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production fell 1.3 percent in September after moving down 0.1 percent in August; output was previously reported to have risen 0.4 percent in August. In September, manufacturing output decreased 0.7 percent: The production of motor vehicles and parts fell 7.2 percent, as shortages of semiconductors continued to hobble operations, while factory output elsewhere declined 0.3 percent. The output of utilities dropped 3.6 percent, as demand for cooling subsided after a warmer-than-usual August. Mining production fell 2.3 percent.
The lingering effects of Hurricane Ida more than accounted for the drop in mining in September; they also contributed 0.3 percentage point to the drop in manufacturing. Overall, about 0.6 percentage point of the drop in total industrial production resulted from the impact of the hurricane.
Despite the decrease in September, total industrial production rose 4.3 percent at an annual rate for the third quarter as a whole, its fifth consecutive quarter with a gain of at least 4 percent.
At 100.0 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production in September was 4.6 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector fell 1.0 percentage point in September to 75.2 percent, a rate that is 4.4 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

This graph shows Capacity Utilization. This series is up from the record low set in April 2020, but below the level in February 2020 (pre-pandemic).
Capacity utilization at 75.2% is 4.4% below the average from 1972 to 2020.  This was well below consensus expectations.
Note: y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the change.

The second graph shows industrial production since 1967.
Industrial production decreased in September to 100.0.  This is 1.3% below the February 2020 level.
The change in industrial production was well below consensus expectations.]]></summary>

비경제학자가 말하는 경제학 바이블. ‘효용’이라는 관점에서 공익과 사익을 보는 방법과 문제점 그리고 한계점에 대해 말한다. ‘효용’이란 무엇인가에 대한 정의부터 ‘저효용’ 시대의 어두움과 ‘고효용’ 시대로 가기 위한 논의들까지, ‘경제’를 어려워하는 사람들도 편히 접근하여 쉽게 읽을 수 있도록 최대한 전문용어를 배제하고 중립적, 객관적으로 한국의 경제에 대해 저술하였다. 세상의 흐름을 읽고 올바르게 분석하기 위한 초석을 다진다.

머리말

1부 효용을 찾기 위한 긴 여행
효용이란 무엇인가
· 최대다수의 최대행복

효용의 시간에 따른 변화
· 효용은 가변적이다
· 미래를 알면 효용을 올릴 수 있을까
· 저효용과 저성장
· 효용을 극대화할 수 없는 이유

2부 가치와 효용
효용과 가치

· 화폐를 통한 상대 가치 
· 기축 통화와 효용
· 기축 통화의 변화
· 원자재로 보는 오늘날의 기축 통화
가치관과 효용 그리고 가치
· 화폐를 통해서 투영된 각 재화의 상대 가치
· 내가 느끼는 재화의 가치와 사회가 느끼는 재화의 가치
· 가치관이라는 단어는 참 특이하다
· 세상의 모든 가치는 가치관이란 필터로 결정된다
효용과 가치 그리고 마케팅
· 가치관과 사용 가치
· 미래적인 효용과 시간 가치
· 사회적 효용(Social Utility)
· 마케팅과 효용
· 광고가 만들어 내는 사회적 가치
가치관의 붕괴

· 갈 곳을 잃은 정부
· 정부의 거짓말 Ⅰ
─정말 공공사업은 정부의 말대로 효용을 증가시킬까
· 효용을 확대시키는 공공 사업이란
· 정부의 거짓말 Ⅱ
─당신을 지켜 주지 못하는 국민연금
지속 가능한 가치와 효용
· 공익(사회전체의 이익) vs. 사익(개인의 이익)
· 가장 행복한 국가?
· 히틀러가 가져온 행복한 사람들
· 고령화가 가져오는 행복?

코로나19를 뛰어넘는 바이러스가 몇 년마다 등장한다면? 진짜보다 더 진짜 같은 가상 인물이 세계 정치를 좌지우지한다면? 50도가 넘는 폭염이 계속된다면? 국내 최고의 미래 연구·교육기관인 카이스트 문술미래전략대학원 미래전략연구센터가 매년 발간하는 미래 보고서《카이스트 미래전략》. 

2022년에는 650여 명의 전문가가 참여해 인류에 의해 일어나는 극단적 사건, ‘X이벤트’를 살펴본다. 슈퍼코로나바이러스, 블랙아웃(대정전), 하이브리드 전쟁, 핀테크와 암호화폐로 인한 금융 대변동 등 우리 사회에 닥칠 수 있는 X이벤트를 제시하고 그 실현 가능성과 여파, 해결과제를 살펴본다. 

이어서 새로운 세상에서 기회를 잡기 위한 전략을 사회, 기술, 환경, 인구, 정치, 경제, 자원 7개 분야로 나눈 S.T.E.P.P.E.R 전략을 제시한다. 위기를 극복하고 그 속에 반짝이는 기회를 잡을 가장 객관적이고 통합적인 미래 전망.

글로벌 팬데믹은 블랙 스완처럼 전 세계인들의 생활 양식을 송두리째 바꾸어놓고 있다. 가까운 미래의 조심스러운 전망도 방역 단계에 따라 춤을 춘다. 예측이 힘든 시대, 그럼에도 불구하고 대중 소비자들의 태도(attitude)에 주목했다. 《2022 트렌드 모니터》는 2022년 변화의 핵심 키워드를 “강력한 영향력을 원하는 ‘슈퍼 개인’의 등장, 그리고 ‘일상적 통제 욕구의 확장’”으로 분석했다. 

끝이 요원해 보이는 팬데믹 상황에서 이 상황을 바꿀 수 없다고 인식한 사람들은 자신의 ‘태도’를 바꾸고 있다. 2022년 대중 소비자들은 막연한 불안감은 줄이고, 앞으로 어떤 변화가 있을지 궁금해하면서, 현재의 만족을 늦추고, 미래에 투자하려고 한다. 코로나19가 끝날 날을 막연히 기대하며 위시리스트를 적는 대신, 짠테크로 절약하고 다양한 방식으로 미래 가치에 투자한다. 불확실한 미래를 준비하기 위해 ‘현재의 만족을 지연(遲延)’시키고 있는 것이다.

이와 동시에 주변 환경과 일상, 사회와 정책 이슈에까지 광범위하게 개입하면서 ‘개인의 통제력’을 확대하려 하고 있다. 대중은 파편화되어 있으면서도, 강력한 영향력을 원하는 ‘슈퍼 개인’이 되려고 하는 듯 보인다. 하지만 ‘답답한’ 상황은 변하지 않는다(2021년 자주 경험하는 감정 1순위–답답하다). 개인은 점점 더 고립되어 가고, 소비…]]></summary>

This phenomenon has competing effects: low rates harm bank profits by squeezing interest margins, but also boost the value of long-term assets held by banks.

삼성그룹 이건희 회장이 타계한지 꼭 1년(10월 25일)이 되었다. 이 책은 고인의 1주기를 맞아 고인과 가까이에서 일했던 전직 삼성맨들을 포함한 다양한 사람들의 생생한 증언을 중심으로 하면서 고인이 남긴 에세이집 ‘생각 좀 하며 세상을 보자’를 부분 발췌해 고인의 사상과 철학을 담았다.

이건희 회장은 기업인이었지만 시대를 앞서 읽은 예언자였으며, 이 힘든 세상을 어떻게 헤쳐가야 할지 지혜를 말해준 사상가였다. 지금까지 이건희 회장을 다룬 많은 책은 오직 그의 리더십과 기업 경영 능력을 다루는 쪽에 국한된 측면이 있다. 그러나 허문명 기자가 전직 삼성맨들의 증언, 고인이 남긴 글과 자료 등을 통해 입체적으로 완성해낸 이 책은 기업인이 아닌 사상가로서의 인간 이건희를 본격 조명한다. 책을 읽다보면 지금은 만날 수 없는 고인의 생각과 삶이 생생하게 느껴진다.

주식에 뛰어든 ‘주린이’들은 각종 전문 용어에 어려워하기 마련이다. D램, 양극재, 전해질, 팹리스 등, 전공자들에게는 기본 상식 수준의 내용이지만, 일상에서는 접하기 어려운 단어들! 주식투자를 꼭 하고 싶지만, 상장사에 대한, 그리고 그 상장사가 속한 산업에 대한 지식이 없는 채 투자를 하는 것은 얼마나 위험한 일인가? 이런 ‘주린이’들을 위해 18년 동안 산업현장을 직접 뛰어다녔던 현직기자인 강경래 작가가 직접 책을 내게 되었다.

강경래 기자는 [강경래의 인더스트리] 연재를 통해 산업에 대한 기초적인 지식과 상식을 전달해주었고, 많은 이들에게 긍정적인 반응을 얻었다. 그리고 조금 더 많은 이들에게 이러한 지식을 전달하고자, ‘주식투자에 꼭 필요한’ 산업 이야기들을 책으로 출간하게 되었다.

인터넷은 혁명을 불러올 것으로 기대되었다. 권위에 저항하고 권력을 무너뜨리고 문화뿐 아니라 정치의 영역에서도 민주화를 확산시킬 것이라 믿어졌다. 하지만 인터넷은 다른 방향으로 흘러가기 시작했다. 군사적 필요에서 등장했고, 국가적 기반을 통해 전파된 인터넷은 어쩌면 처음부터 중립적인 도구가 아니었을지도 모른다. 인터넷 시대를 맞아 몇몇 새로운 기업이 등장했지만, 이들 역시 인터넷이라는 구조가 만들어놓은 철로를 따라 움직이는 기차일 뿐이다. 

인터넷은 원래부터 권력과 지배력과 돈을 가지고 있던 사람들에게 더 많은 권력과 지배력과 돈을 안겨주었다. 인터넷과 인터넷이 작동하는 방식은 소수의 신념과 동기와 이해에 따라 결정되었다. 인터넷의 진짜 구조를 들여다보면 현대 세계를 움직이는 거대한 권력이 드러난다. 

현대 사회를 지배하고 있는 인터넷 기술과 문화를 통해 과거와 현재를 진단하는 이 책은 수면 아래 감춰진 인터넷의 진짜 구조를 파헤친다. 1부에서 저자는 인터넷을 만든 사람과 연결하는 사람, 관리하는 사람을 만난다. 이들은 인터넷이라는 시스템의 탄생과 유지에 기여하는 사람들이다. 

2부에서는 인터넷으로 가장 큰 이익을 얻는 집단인, 투자자와 광고업자를 다룬다. 세계적인 영향력을 행사하는 것으로 보이는 첨단 기술기업일지라도 중요한 결정권은 모두 투자자들에게 있음을 보게 될 것이다. 3부는 인터넷에서 벌어지는 전쟁을 다룬다. 인터넷은 문화적 영향력을 겨루는 전선이자, 강대국들의 전장이다. 국가와 기업, 시민단체, 개인이 뒤엉켜 전선은 광범위하게 펼쳐진다.

디지털 자산에 대한 명확한 개념과 현재 주목받는 디지털 자산의 종류를 정리하고, 국내외 글로벌 기업들의 사례 제시와 함께 전망 분석까지 나아간다. 이를 통해 디지털 자산에 관심을 가진 투자자들에게는 새로운 부의 기준을 소개하고, 관련 업계 종사자들에게는 미래 경제전망과 인사이트를 제시한다. 특히 자산에 대한 관점의 변화과정과 생태계 확장 속도를 다룸으로써, 가장 최신의 내용을 상세하게 담고 있다.

이 책은 비트코인이나 블록체인의 기술을 분석하거나 설명하는 기술서가 아니다. 그보다는 디지털 자산을 특정한 코인으로만 알고 있거나 모호하게 알고 있는 독자들에게 정확한 개념을 전하고 디지털 자산의 탄생으로 인한 변화를 알기 쉽게 설명한다. 

이와 더불어 디지털 자산 투자자들을 위한 안내서 역할도 하고 있다. 독자들은 이 책을 통해 디지털 시대로 나아가기 위해서 필수요소인 디지털 자산을 이해하고 관련 미래를 전망해 그 이면에 감춰진 인사이트를 파악할 수 있을 것이다. 

또한, 이 책은 현재 디지털 자산의 기술이 어디까지 발전했으며 글로벌 기업들이 주목하는 지점은 어디인지 한눈에 보여준다. 시장과 전망에 대한 이해가 선행돼야 미래의 부를 차지하기 위한 싸움에서 승리할 수 있다.

우리는 사회에 나오는 순간 금융의 세계를 만난다. 근로계약서를 작성하고 월급을 받아 세금을 내고, 신용카드로 물건을 산다. 월급의 일부를 저축하고, 돈이 없으면 대출을 받으며, 다치면 보험처리를 한다. 일상에서 숨 쉬듯 이루어지는 모든 활동이 ‘금융 생활’이다.

이 책은 언젠가 우리가 마주하게 될 ‘금융의 세계’를 낮은 시선으로 알려준다. 본문 내용이 누군가에게는 상식이고 누군가에게는 세상 쉬운 정보일 수도 있다. 하지만 책의 제목처럼 다른 사람은 아는 것을 나만 모르는 것 같아 ‘물어보기 부끄러워 묻지 못한’ 사람도 분명 존재할 것이다. 이들이 앞으로 살아가며 마주하게 될 돈과 관련된 상황에서 조금이나마 도움이 되길 바란다.

주식시장을 강타하는 주가폭락은 월가의 투자가들에게도 두려움의 대상이다. 공포심을 자극하는 각종 기사와 보고서가 쏟아지고 투매가 벌어진다. 이런 상황에서 이성적으로 투자 결정을 내리기란 무척 어렵다. 원칙 없는 감정적인 대처 때문에 막대한 손실을 입기도 한다. 

크로스비는 이처럼 주식투자의 성공과 실패를 가르는 열쇠가 판단력을 흐리는 심리적 요인에 있음을 밝히고, 심리적 요인을 통제해 수익을 극대화하는 성공적인 투자법을 연구했다. 행동투자의 선구자인 그의 글과 강연은 월가의 투자가들이 더 나은 투자 결정을 내리는 통찰의 원천이 되고 있다. 

이 책 《시장을 이기는 부의 심리학》은 출간 당시 일반 투자자들뿐만 아니라 수많은 펀드 매니저, 투자 컨설턴트에게 찬사를 받은 크로스비의 대표 저작이다. 중요한 상황에 직면했을 때 과도한 시도를 추구하는 경향인 행동편향이 어떻게 투자 성과를 망치는지 보여주고, 대안적 투자 기법으로 규칙 기반의 행동 투자 모델(RIB)을 제시한다. 

저자는 감정적인 투자자가 흥분 상태에서 주식을 너무 비싸게 매수하고 절망적인 상태에서 너무 싸게 매도할 수 있다고 지적한다. 또한 지나친 걱정 때문에 시장의 혼란이 큰 수익의 전조가 될 수 있음에도, 그 시점을 인지하는 데 실패한다고 말한다. 자기 자신의 심리상태가 성공 투자의 걸림돌이 되는 것이다.

한 주에도 몇 개씩 쏟아져 나오는 신조어, 신상품, 새로운 매체를 좇는 대신 생활변화의 흐름을 이해하는 오늘날의 시대감성을 제시한다. 완벽함보다는 노력형, 예쁨보다는 멋짐으로 대변되는 시대감성과 지루한 일상을 콘텐츠로 승화하는 이들의 이야기가 펼쳐진다. 또한 주가가 오르고 내리듯 시세와 차트를 만드는 디지털 밈, 하이퍼리얼리즘과 메타버스 등, 한 번쯤 들어봤지만 정확하게 이해하지는 못했던 오늘의 문화코드에 대해서도 알 수 있을 것이다. 

새로운 세대가 궁금한가? ‘요즘 애들은 어떤 애들이야?’, ‘뭐 하고 놀아?’라는 막연한 질문으로는 답을 얻을 수 없다. 그럴수록 점점 시대감성에서 동떨어진 존재가 될 뿐이다. 그들이 남긴 흔적과 데이터가 담고 있는 스토리를 보아야 한다. 그 속에서 탄생하는 문화를 보고, 새로운 시대가 요청하는 것에 행보를 맞춰야 한다. 도표와 이야기로 풀어가는 2022년의 미래상을 따라감으로써, 무엇이든 잊히기 쉬운 이 시대에 기억되는 사람, 기억되는 브랜드가 되는 힌트를 얻을 수 있을 것이다.

2. 기록 : 누구나 콘텐츠를 만들 수 있다, ‘꾸준히’ 기록하라
3. 남자 : 공정한 차별, 공평한 경쟁
4. 현실 : 지하철 3호선에서 시작하는 판타지
5. 연대 : 소속감에서 연대감으로
6. 열정 : Z세대의 #리스펙, #생리얼, #갓생
7. 과금 : 플랫폼에 돈을 내는 소비자, 돈을 받아가는 소비자
마케터를 위한 시사점

1부 세계관의 변화

마케터를 위한 시사점

3장 상상이 현실이 되거나, 현실이 상상이 되거나
우리가 일상에 ‘판타지’를 받아들이기 시작한 이유
현실과 가장 가까운 판타지 : 하이퍼리얼리즘
판타지와 가장 가까운 현실 : 메타버스
모든 현실과 모든 판타지에 세계관이 요구된다

가장 개인적이고 가장 전문적인 비밀 이야기 : 뉴스레터
누구나 생산자가 될 수 있지만, 누구나 플랫폼은 될 수 없다 : 라이브방송
디지털 플랫폼과 아날로그 관계 맺기의 융합

16가지의 키워드를 통해 위드 코로나 시대에 접어들면서 달라진 라이프스타일의 변화 방향성을 탐색하고, 디지털 기반으로 변화되는 시대상과 마케팅에 대한 속 깊은 이야기를 들려준다. 

이 책은 글로벌 광고마케팅 회사 이노션 인사이트그룹에서 근무하는 16인의 컨설턴트가 치열한 분석 끝에 내놓은 특별한 보고서로, 그저 변화하는 현상의 나열이 아닌 변화의 원인과 그 변화가 궁극적으로 가져올 마케팅 커뮤니케이션에서의 시사점과 활용 가치에 주안점을 둔다. 나아가 위드 코로나 시대의 일상과 놀이문화, 각종 제도적 변화로 인해 달라질 세상의 모습, 사회문화적 환경 변화 속에서의 마케팅 이슈들에 대해 치열하게 고민한 결과물을 담았다. 

또한 이 책에는 어디에서도 볼 수 없는 ‘스페셜 리포트’가 수록됐는데, 이는 소비자 행동과 브랜드에 대한 태도, 마케팅 환경의 급격한 변화에도 불구하고 기존 방식으로 분석한 지수들에 의존한다는 비판적 시선에서 탄생한 것으로, 앞으로 주목받을 ‘쿨한’ 브랜드에 대해 심층적으로 분석한 내용을 선보인다. 

이 책에는 마케팅 환경의 변화와 브랜드가 가진 고민을 가장 가까이에서 체감하는 광고대행사의 마케팅 커뮤니케이션 전문가들이 현장에서 겪은 경험이 생생하게 담겨 있다. 각종 행사나 회의가 온라인으로 대체되고 사람들끼리 한 공간에서 이야기하기도 힘든 위드 코로나 …]]></summary>

전국을 뒤덮던 ‘도시재생사업’이 마무리되었거나 종료를 앞두고 있다. 그간 막대한 예산이 투입된 지원사업임에도 불구하고 현장에서는 지원이 종료된 이후의 지속가능성을 두고 고심이 깊다. 그럼 지원사업이 종료되더라도 지역에서 발생하는 다양한 문제를 해결하며 유지, 관리해 갈 방법은 무엇인가. 

주민들이 지역자원을 발굴하고 창업과 일자리를 창출해 지역경제를 활성화하는 도시재생기업이 그 해결책으로 주목받고 있다. 하지만 창업과 일자리 창출은 수많은 변수로 리크스가 크고 두서없이 시작했다가 거듭된 실패로 포기가 속출하는 쉽지 않은 도전이다. 따라서 주민의 창업 성공률을 높이고 기업을 안정궤도에 안착시킬 도구가 필요하다. 도시재생기업을 운영할 주민들의 역량을 강화할 도구로 <지역경제조직 워크북>이 개발되었다.

서학개미를 위한 미국 주식 퀀트투자 입문+실습서이다. 퀀트투자는 수학적, 통계적 기법을 활용해 투자 종목을 발굴하는 투자 방법이다. 퀀트투자 전략을 만들기 위해서는 유명한 전략들이 어떻게 만들어졌는지 개념을 이해하고, 어떻게 구현됐는지 기본기를 따라 하며 배워야 한다. 다만 투자 대가들의 전략을 소개한 책은 쉽게 찾아볼 수 있지만, 그 전략을 구현한 기술적인 방법을 담은 책은 매우 찾아보기 어렵다. 또한 퀀트투자 전략을 공부하기 위해서는 코딩이나 수학 등 부가적인 배경지식이 필요하다. 

이 책은 이미 잘 알려진 투자 대가들의 전략을 소개하고 자신의 컴퓨터에서 이 전략을 구현해보며 응용하는 방법을 알려준다. 책을 따라 미국 주식 퀀트투자 과정을 배우고 나면 자신만의 투자 전략을 스스로 개발할 수 있을 것이다.
