        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What should researchers do when confronted with surprising results? Financial access innovations usually leave “temptation” spending unaffected or reduced. However, we found that promotion of savings lockboxes in a largely autarkic society increased alcohol consumption and blood pressure, despite no one reporting intentions to save for alcohol. To probe mechanisms that could explain this pattern, we then used ethnographic methods, including direct observations of drinking (“scans”) and debriefing interviews to discuss the earlier trial results. We learn that sponsoring drinks confers prestige, but the stigma attached to drinking by outsiders likely discouraged reporting intentions to save for it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We develop a machine-learning solution algorithm to solve for optimal portfolio choice in a detailed and quantitatively-accurate lifecycle model that includes many features of reality modelled only separately in previous work.  We use the quantitative model to evaluate the consumption-equivalent welfare losses from using simple rules for portfolio allocation across stocks, bonds, and liquid accounts instead of the optimal portfolio choices. We find that the consumption-equivalent losses from using an age-dependent rule as embedded in current target-date/lifecycle funds (TDFs) are substantial, around 2 to 3 percent of consumption, despite the fact that TDF rules mimic average optimal behavior by age closely until shortly before retirement. Our model recommends higher average equity shares in the second half of life than the portfolio of the typical TDF, so that the typical TDF portfolio does not improve on investing an age-independent 2/3 share in equity. Finally, optimal equity shares have substantial heterogeneity, particularly by wealth level, state of the business cycle, and dividend-price ratio, implying substantial gains to further customization of advice or TDFs in these dimensions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For whom has earnings risk changed, and why? To answer these questions, we develop a filtering method that estimates parameters of an income process and recovers persistent and temporary earnings for every individual at every point in time. Our estimation flexibly allows for first and second moments of shocks to depend upon observables as well as spells of zero earnings (i.e., unemployment) and easily integrates into theoretical models. We apply our filter to a unique linkage of 23.5m SSA-CPS records. We first demonstrate that our earnings-based filter successfully captures observable shocks in the SSA-CPS data, such as job switching and layoffs. We then show that despite a decline in overall earnings risk since the 1980s, persistent earnings risk has risen for both employed and unemployed workers, while temporary earnings risk declined. Furthermore, the size of persistent earnings losses associated with full year unemployment has increased by 50%. Using geography, education, and occupation information in the SSA-CPS records, we refute hypotheses related to declining employment prospects among routine and low-skill workers as well as spatial theories related to the decline of the Rust-Belt. We show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. Lastly, we find that rising persistent earnings risk while employed (unemployed) leads to welfare losses equivalent to 1.8% (0.7%) of lifetime consumption, and larger persistent earnings losses while unemployed lead to a 3.3% welfare loss.]]></summary>

We report results from lab experiments focused on such information-collection processes. We consider decisions governed by individuals and groups and compare how voting rules affect outcomes. We also contrast static information collection, as in classical hypothesis testing, with dynamic collection, as in sequential hypothesis testing. Several insights emerge. Static information collection is excessive, and sequential information collection is non-stationary, producing declining decision accuracies over time. Furthermore, groups using majority rule yield especially hasty and inaccurate decisions. Nonetheless, sequential information collection is welfare enhancing relative to static collection, particularly when unanimous rules are used.]]></summary>

On average, countries decreased exports to China and increased exports to the US and rest of world. Most countries export products that complement the US and substitute China, and a subset operate along downward-sloping supplies. Heterogeneity in responses, rather than specialization, drives export variation across countries. Surprisingly, global trade increased in the products targeted by tariffs. Thus, despite ending the trend towards tariff reductions, the trade war did not halt global trade growth.]]></summary>

Time-series analysis for each province and for France, Italy and Germany corroborates this finding, and we estimate cumulative gains of up to 5 percentage points in provincial vaccination rates and 790,000 or more first doses for Canada as a whole as of October 31, 2021 (5 to 13 weeks after the provincial mandate announcements). We also find large vaccination gains in France (3 to 5 mln first doses), Italy (around 6 mln) and Germany (around 3.5 mln) 11 to 16 weeks after the proof of vaccination mandate announcements.]]></summary>

When interventions are ex post efficient, a government cannot commit not to inject capital into the banking system. Contrary to common wisdom, we show that the government may still avoid moral hazard and implement the first best allocation by using the distribution of bailouts across banks to provide ex ante incentives. In particular, we analyze properties of credible tournament mechanisms that provide support to the best performing banks and resolve the worst performing ones, including through mergers. Our mechanism continues to perform well if banks are partially substitutable, and if they are heterogeneous in their size, interconnections, and thus systemic risk, as long as bailout funds can be targeted to particular banks.]]></summary>

Customers, as opposed to transactions per customer or dollar sales per transaction, consistently account for about 80% of sales variation. The top 1% of growing and shrinking merchants account for about 70% of customer and sales reallocation in a given year. In order to illustrate some of the potential implications, we write down an endogenous growth model with and without the customer margin. In the context of this model, we find that the customer margin dramatically increases the size and growth contribution of the largest firms, but lowers the aggregate growth rate by diverting resources from research to customer acquisition activities.]]></summary>

In this paper, we examine the impact of reimbursement rates on health care supply by studying a policy that reduced reimbursement rates by 30% in one of the highest-reimbursing workers' compensation insurance systems in the nation. Despite the large decrease in reimbursement rates, we find no evidence that the policy affected the amount of health care that injured workers receive or recoveries after injuries. Our estimates suggest that the policy reduced annual workers' compensation medical costs by over $400 million and indicate that providers may be operating on the inelastic portion of the supply curve for care paid for by high-reimbursing payers.]]></summary>

I study how a paternal health shock affects grandchildren's longevity in a unique setting where the ancestral stressor is the grandfather's ex-POW status in the US Civil War (1861-5) and the children are born after the war.  Ancestral stress is associated with longevity after age 45 of male-line grandsons but not of granddaughters or female-line grandchildren.  I rule out transmission through socioeconomic channels and direct cultural transmission from grandfather to grandson.  An epigenetic explanation is consistent with observed male-line transmission at epigenetically sensitive ancestral ages and mediation by own late gestational conditions.    Consistent with epigenetic reprogramming depending on the in-utero environment, the association between the veteran's ex-POW status and that of his male-line descendants declines across generations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global agricultural trade, which increased at the end of 2020, has been described as “resilient” to the impacts of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic; however, the size and channels of its quantitative impacts are not clear. Using a reduced-form, gravity-based econometric model for monthly trade, we estimate the effects of COVID-19 incidence rates, policy restrictions imposed by governments to curb the outbreak, and the de facto reduction in human mobility/lockdown effect on global agricultural trade through the end of 2020. We find that while agricultural trade remained quite stable through the pandemic, the sector as a whole did not go unscathed. First, we estimate that COVID-19 reduced agricultural trade by the approximate range of 5 to 10 percent at the aggregate sector level; a quantified impact two to three times smaller in magnitude than our estimated impact on trade occurring in the non-agricultural sector. Second, we find sharp differences across individual commodities. In particular, we find that non-food items (hides and skins, ethanol, cotton, and other commodities), meat products including seafood, and higher value agri-food products were most severely impacted by the pandemic; however, the COVID- 19 trade effect for the majority of food and bulk agricultural commodity sectors were found to be insignificant, or in a few cases, positive. Finally, we also examine the effects across low vs high income countries, the changing dynamics of the pandemic’s effect on trade flows, and the effects along the extensive product margins of trade.]]></summary>

Panel data on individual worker earnings reveal that less educated, older, and more highly-paid workers experience significantly greater declines in average earnings and earnings risk following related technological advances.

The BLS diffusion index for total private employment was at 63.0 in November, down from 73.9 in October.
For manufacturing, the diffusion index was at 67.3, up from 66.7 the previous month.
Think of this as a measure of how widespread job gains or losses are across industries. The further from 50 (above or below), the more widespread the job losses or gains reported by the BLS.  From the BLS: 
Figures are the percent of industries with employment increasing plus one-half of the industries with unchanged employment, where 50 percent indicates an equal balance between industries with increasing and decreasing employment.

While the unemployment rate continues to fall quickly, labor force participation has made no progress since August 2020. ... Most of the 5.0mn persons who have exited the labor force since the start of the pandemic are over age 55 (3.4mn), largely reflecting early (1.5mn) and natural (1mn) retirements that likely won’t reverse. The outlook for prime-age persons who have exited the labor force (1.7mn) is more positive, since very few are discouraged and most still view their exits as temporary.

... today's effective rates were a bit lower versus Friday afternoon.  Improvement mostly followed a bond rally which, in turn, followed weakness in the stock market.  Low volume contributed to the size of the move, which is to say it would have been even smaller during a busier time of the year for financial markets.
Nonetheless, things will probably get fairly busy in the middle of the week after the Federal Reserve releases its new policy statement.  The Fed is expected to announce that it will curtail its rate-friendly bond purchases at a faster pace.  [30 year fixed 3.17%]

Excerpt: 
Looks like we will see new record low inventories this winter
...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 14.7% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 28.7% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 25.4% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market..

The first graph shows the PCE price index since January 2020 (before the pandemic), and the dashed blue line is the Fed's target of 2%.
 Click on graph for larger image.
The recent increase in inflation has led to some analysts to call for the Fed to raise rates.   For example, from CNBC this morning: El-Erian says ‘transitory’ was the ‘worst inflation call in the history’ of the Fed
“If I were them, I would do three things, which they will not do,” [El-Erian] said during a “Squawk Box” interview. “I would 1) be very open and honest as to why I got the inflation call wrong and try to regain the inflation narrative. 2) I would go even further than doubling the rate of taper, and 3) I would open it up to the possibility that rate hikes may come faster than what the market has. They’re not gonna do that."
The FOMC will likely announce a faster pace of tapering assets purchases at the meeting this week, and asset purchases will probably end in March (if not sooner).

 The second graph is from January 2005 (just an arbitrary date).
This shows that inflation has been below target for years.  If we were doing price targeting (we aren't), then prices would just be getting back to the target.
The graphs for core PCE inflation show the same pattern, but core PCE is even further below the trend line.
The question is not will some prices "stick", but rather will YoY inflation ease back towards the Fed's target?  Or will inflation stay elevated?
My sense is inflation will ease back towards the Fed's target over the next year.]]></summary>

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of December 10th, inventory was at 339 thousand (7-day average), compared to 469 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 27.7%.  Inventory is down 3.3% from last week.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 58.8% from 822 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 350 thousand, and was down 27.1% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory last week was about 10.6% above the record low set-in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September, when inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 22.5% from the peak for the year.

기본소득은 과연 가능할까. 인공지능과 로봇이 인간의 노동력을 대체할 미래에는 기본소득으로 불평등과 빈곤문제를 해결할 것으로 전망하는 실정이다. 제도의 취지나 당위로는 더할 나위가 없다. 관건은 재원 마련이다. 막대한 돈이 드는 기본소득을 현실로 옮길 수 있을까. 이 책 『모두의 기본소득, 재원을 마련하다』의 저자들은 “기본소득 지급도, 재원조달도 모두 가능하다”고 입을 모은다.

기본소득 재원 마련의 철학적 기초는 ‘공유부’에 있다. 토지, 환경, 지식, 데이터 등 모두에게 속한 공유부의 수익을 평등하게 나눈다는 것이다. 이 책은 기본소득으로 지급할 수 있는 재원으로서, 공유부에 근거해 정당성을 획득한 모든 방안을 다룬다.

기본소득 금액을 먼저 정하고 이에 부합하는 재정모델을 설정한 다음 지급 방안을 마련하는 접근과는 다르다. 조달 가능한 재원을 최대한으로 모색하고 그 규모를 추계해 제시하는 방식이다. 실현가능한 재원조달 방안들과 조달액 추계 범위 내에서 상황에 따라 단계별로 취할 수 있는 조합을 모색하는 데 도움이 된다.

Swift and broad administration of vaccines provides a significant boost to health outcomes, particularly in the midst of major outbreaks and accompanied by containment measures.]]></summary>

This column reports on an experiment in Japan examining whether people altered their vaccination intentions based on information about how their decision could affect vaccine uptake by others. Hearing that getting vaccinated could encourage uptake by others around them increased the proportion of older adults who would receive the vaccine if offered for free, while hearing that not getting vaccinated may discourage uptake by others strengthened the intention to get vaccinated among older adults who had already indicated their willingness to be vaccinated. Finally, hearing how likely others of a similar age were to get vaccinated also strengthened existing intentions – whether pro- or anti-vaccination.

From Goldman Sachs: 
"The FOMC is very likely to double the pace of tapering to $30bn per month at its December meeting next week, putting it on track to announce the last two tapers at the January FOMC meeting and to implement the last taper in March. We now expect the FOMC to deliver rate hikes next year in May, July, and November (vs. June, September, and December previously)."
Analysts will also be looking for comments on inflation and on rate hikes in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This data is as of December 7th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearance Plan Exits Drop Significantly
Active forbearance plan totals plunged in the first full week of December, led by portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans fell by 112,000 (-11%) this week, led by a 49,000 (-15%) drop in PLS/portfolio loans. FHA/VA plan volumes dropped 42,000 (-12%) followed by GSE (21,000/-7%). There is a modest opportunity for additional improvement in coming weeks with 33,000 loans still listed with November reviews for extension/removal (roughly half of which are expected to be reaching their final expirations).
As of December 7, 882,000 mortgage holders (1.7%) remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, including 1.1% of GSE, 2.6% of FHA/VA and 2.1% of portfolio/PLS.
  Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Overall, the number of forbearance plans is down by 177,000 (-17%) from the same time last month, with the potential for modest additional improvements through the end of the year. Plan starts over the past four weeks are up 24% from the preceding four-week period, driven by a more than 40% increase among FHA/VA loans (with GSEs seeing a 29% increase). This is a trend we’ll be watching closely as we round out the year.

Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 15.8% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 25.0% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 23.3% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the median Consumer Price Index rose 0.5% in November. The 16% trimmed-mean Consumer Price Index increased 0.5% in November. "The median CPI and 16% trimmed-mean CPI are measures of core inflation calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on data released in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) monthly CPI report".
Note: The Cleveland Fed released the median CPI details here: "Fuel oil and other fuels" were up 104% annualized.

Note that Owners' Equivalent Rent and Rent of Primary Residence account for almost 1/3 of median CPI, and these measures were up around 5% to 6% annualized in November.

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.8 percent in November on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.9 percent in October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 6.8 percent before seasonal adjustment.
The monthly all items seasonally adjusted increase was the result of broad increases in most component indexes, similar to last month. The indexes for gasoline, shelter, food, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles were among the larger contributors. The energy index rose 3.5 percent in November as the gasoline index increased 6.1 percent and the other major energy component indexes also rose. The food index increased 0.7 percent as the index for food at home rose 0.8 percent. 
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.5 percent in Novemberfollowing a 0.6-percent increase in October. Along with shelter, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles, the indexes for household furnishings and operations, apparel, and airline fares were among those that increased. The indexes for motor vehicle insurance, recreation, and communication all declined in November.
 The all items index rose 6.8 percent for the 12 months ending October, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1982. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.9 percent over the last 12 months, while the energy index rose 33.3 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 6.1 percent. These changes are the largest 12-month increases in at least 13 years in the respective series.

Both CPI and core CPI were close to expectations.  I'll post a graph later today after the Cleveland Fed releases the median and trimmed-mean CPI.]]></summary>

자오궈둥.이환환.쉬위엔중 지음, 정주은 옮김, 김정이 감수 / 미디어숲 / 2022년 01월 / ISBN:9791158741365
정가: 18,800원 / 판매가: 16,920원 / 마일리지: 73원
이벤트: 12월 특별선물! 피너츠 피규어 독서등, 크리스마스 오르골 (이벤트 도서 포함, 국내서.외서 5만원 이상)




현재 뜨겁게 논쟁이 일고 있는 메타버스에 대한 전반적인 이해를 넘어서 산업 생태계, 관리, 경제학, 기반시설 등 여러 각도에서 생각해 봐야 할 관점을 보여 준다. 저자들은 과거 디지털 경제를 연구하면서 깨달은 바에 과학 기술 분야의 가장 놀랄 만한 변혁을 결합해 향후 발전 방향의 윤곽을 정리했다.

문제는 인류가 앞으로 살아갈 이 디지털 신세계에서는 과거 전통 경제에서 당연하다고 여겨졌던 기본 원칙들이 모두 통하지 않는다는 것이다. 더구나 이 책의 서문을 쓴 이더리움의 창시자 비탈릭 부테린은 메타버스의 디지털 자산 규모가 머지않아 현실 세계의 자산 규모를 넘어설 것이라고 예언한다.

메타버스는 단순한 경제가 아니라 ‘사회’이며 더욱이 M세대(메타버스 세대)가 만든 포스트모던 사회다. 메타버스에는 경제 현상은 물론이고 문화 현상과 사회 현상도 있다. 국가, 민족, 지역, 시간의 경계를 초월한 이 사회는 어떤 문명을 만들어낼까? 이 책은 도래할 메타버스 시대를 준비하고 기회를 포착하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

블록체인이란 거래정보가 중앙 서버에 집중되지 않고, 네트워크의 여러 컴퓨터에 분산해서 저장되는 것을 말한다. 블록체인 기술에 주목하는 이유는 저렴한 비용으로 투명하고 안전한 전자금융거래가 가능해질 것이라는 기대감 때문이다. 비용 측면에서도 블록체인은 기술의 특성상 막대한 비용절감 효과를 기대할 수 있기에 금융권과 공공서비스 부문의 블록체인 도입은 더욱 활발해질 전망이다.

Excerpt: 
In Q3 2021, mortgage debt increased $230 billion, the largest quarterly increase since 2006.
...
 For Q3 2021, the Net Equity Extraction was $147 billion, or 3.24% of Disposable Personal Income (DPI).   The last two quarters have shown a sharp increase in equity extraction compared to recent years, but the level is nothing like the amount of equity extraction during the housing bubble as a percent of DPI. During the housing bubble we saw several quarters with MEW above 8% of DPI.
...
The bottom line is the recent increase in MEW is not concerning - it is far less as a percent of disposable personal income than during the bubble, and most homeowners have substantial equity.]]></summary>

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Occupancy Hovers Around Mid-50%
U.S. hotel occupancy increased from the previous week, but performance comparisons with 2019 were lower, according to STR‘s latest data through December 4.
November 28 through December 4, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 54.8% (-8.8%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $127.92 (-0.5%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $70.08 (-9.2%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Although down compared to 2019, the 4-week average of the occupancy rate is close to the median rate for the previous 20 years (Blue).


Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The occupancy rate will now decline seasonally into the new year.]]></summary>

20세기 가장 위대한 경제학자, 케인스. 그는 경제 이론과 경제 정책에 있어 위대한 지적 혁명을 촉발시켰다. 이 책은 수학 방정식 등을 최소화하면서, 대학교 학부학생, 열린 마음을 가지고 있는 기존 강단 경제학자, 공무원 그리고 일반 경제인 등 다양한 계층의 독자 모두가 쉽게 케인스의 경제 사상을 이해할 수 있도록 설명하고 있다.

이 책은 케인스 이론의 핵심적인 개념들, 즉 시장경제에 있어서 불확실성, 균형의 의미, 화폐의 역할, 그리고 유효수요의 원칙을 설명함으로써, 이러한 핵심 개념을 철저히 무시하고 있는 기존 주류 경제학과 그 안에서의 자칭 케인지언들이 가지는 오류를 지적하고 있다.

또한 그에 비추어 현대 경제에 있어서 다양한 논쟁점들, 즉 고용과 실업의 문제, 재정과 금융 정책, 국제수지 문제 등에 대한 케인스적인 해결 방안을 시사하고 있다. 특히 그러한 논의들을 역사적 배경(베르사유조약부터 브레턴우즈 체제까지)과 연결시키고, 또한 케인스의 경제 이론이 현재의 유로존 문제에 어떤 해결점을 제시할 수 있는지도 검토한다.

지금 우리가 처한 세계를 이해하는 가장 적합한 키워드가 있다면 그것은 ‘불평등’이다. 토마 피케티는 지난 몇십 년 동안 전 세계적으로 소득과 부의 불평등이 증가했다고 말한다. 그의 책 『21세기 자본』이 촉발한 불평등이라는 주제는 경제뿐 아니라 정치, 사회적으로 경각심을 일으키고 커다란 영향을 끼쳤다. 

경제학자 이정우는 피케티의 첫 책과 함께 최근작 『자본과 이데올로기』와 여러 저명한 경제학자가 함께 쓴 『세계불평등보고서 2018』을 통해 피케티가 정확히 어떤 진단을 내리고 있는지 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 불평등 문제를 해소하기 위해 피케티가 제시한 사회국가, 누진소득세, 세계자본세 그리고 참여사회주의와 참여연방주의 등의 처방에 대해서도 살펴본다. 

저자가 피케티의 책을 안내하는 이유는 한국 사회의 불평등을 바로 보고, 그에 따른 대안을 제안하고자 하는 데 있다. 한국은 소득 불평등, 정규직과 비정규직의 양극화, 부동산으로 인한 자산 불평등이 유독 심각하다. 저자는 이 문제의 해결 없이는 한국 경제의 지속적인 발전과 선진국 진입은 어렵다고 말한다. 나아가 한국이 처한 현실을 냉정하게 드러내 보여주고, 더 나은 세상으로 바꿔나가기 위한 다양한 해법들을 제시하고 있다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 ‘테라 인코그니타: 공존을 위한 새로운 시대정신을 찾아’를 아젠다로 제안했다. 한 번도 가보지 않은 새로운 세계는 우리에게 기회가 될 수도, 위협이 될 수도 있다. 하지만 정치.경제.학술.문화 등 각 분야의 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 통해 미래를 예측하고 준비할 수 있다면, 위협 또한 기회로 바꿀 수 있을 것이다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 현재 우리가 직면한 문제를 ‘정치 변화의 역학 Global Power Dynamics’, ‘비즈니스의 새 정의 New Business Path’, ‘부의 탐색 Wealth Discovery’, ‘넷제로 레이스 Race to Net-zero’, ‘비욘드 그래비티 Beyond Gravity’, ‘새로운 세계로의 입문 Hello, New World’ 등 6개의 대주제로 정하고 이에 대한 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 들었다.

TensorFlow와 sklearn을 사용해 금융이나 경제 맥락에 인공지능을 접목하는 방법론을 설명한다. 먼저 경제학이 추구하는 지향점과 머신러닝의 특징과 장점을 비교해 같은 점과 다른 점을 분석한 다음 양 측면에서 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 방대한 참고문헌과 함께 설명한다. 기초적인 회귀에서 출발해 결정 트리와 랜덤 포레스트를 살펴보고 이미지 처리와 자연어 처리가 금융 맥락에서 어떻게 활발하게 활용되고 있는지 설명한다. 특히 자연어 처리 부분이 금융 맥락과 접목되는 지점은 다양한 실습과 예제를 통해 손쉽게 이해하도록 돕는다.

금융 데이터의 특징인 시계열 데이터는 RNN과 LSTM를 활용해 설명한다. 또한 생성적 모델을 적용하는 방법과 이론적 모델 부분도 다룬다. 각 장은 모두 예제와 코드를 지원하며 이를 통해 각 상황을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 기초를 제공한다. 책에서 제공하는 방대한 참고문헌은 금융 맥락에서 인공지능을 접목하려던 수많은 학자의 발자취를 살펴볼 귀중한 자료다.

“수신료의 가치를 증명한 명품 다큐” 등 시청자들의 뜨거운 호평을 받은 2021년 화제의 다큐멘터리 〈팬데믹 머니〉가 책으로 만들어졌다. 2차 세계대전 이후 최악의 실물경제와 최대 호황을 맞이한 자산 시장이 교차하는 이 모순된 현실은 왜 발생하는 걸까? 

그 답을 구하기 위해 〈팬데믹 머니〉 제작진은 제러미 리프킨, 제이슨 솅커, 오건영, 박종훈 등 국내외 최고 경제 전문가들을 만나 달러라는 기축통화가 작동하는 방식부터 어마어마하게 풀린 돈이 거품과 부채를 만들고 결국 경제 위기를 불러일으키는 과정을 깊이 있게 추적한다.

특히 『팬데믹 머니: 감염된 경제, 풀린 돈의 역습에 대비하라』는 방송에서 미처 다 보여주지 못한 전문가들과의 대담을 수록했다. 또한 2022년 달라질 경제 환경과 자산 시장에 대해 통화정책 전문가 김진일 고려대 교수와 금융 전문가 오건영 신한은행 부부장과 이야기를 나눴다.

금리와 환율만 알면 경제 공부 다했다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 금리와 환율에는 국내외 경제 상황이 총체적으로 반영되어 있기 때문이다. 금리와 환율이 주가에 미치는 영향이나 상관관계에 따른 책은 많으나, 금리와 환율에만 초점을 맞추며 경제를 풀어내는 책은 찾기 어렵다. 그래서 ‘거시경제의 거장’이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 『금리와 환율 알고 갑시다』를 통해 어렵고 복잡한 경제이론과 시장의 상황을 낱낱이 분석하여 자신만의 철학으로 쉽게 명쾌하게 풀어낸다. 

지금 우리에게 필요한 것은 단순 금리와 환율의 개념이 아니다. 금리와 환율을 통해 현재의 경제 상황을 이해하고, 미래를 내다볼 수 있는 통찰력을 갖추어 조금 더 명확하게 경제의 흐름을 파악하는 안목이다. 그 깊이 있는 안목은 금리 인상(하락), 환율 변동, 집값 상승(하락) 등의 위기에도 올바른 판단과 실행을 이룰 수 있게 도와줄 것이다.

프롤로그: 금리와 환율 알고 갑시다

제1부 금리 알고 갑시다
금리란 무엇일까요?
• 금리의 기원은 신용에 있습니다
• 경제학 교과서에서는 현재의 소비를 참는 데에 대한 대가를 금리라 합니다
한국은행의 통화정책 수단, 기준금리
• 한국은행의 기준금리는 모든 금리의 기준입니다
• 기준금리는 한국은행 금융통화위원회에서 결정합니다
• 통화정책방향 결정문과 의사록은 꼭 보아야 합니다
• 비둘기파와 매파의 구분은 이렇습니다
• 한국은행은 기준금리를 왜 올리고 내릴까요?
• 기준금리는 어떻게 물가에 영향을 주나요?
• 미국의 기준금리는 연방기금금리 입니다
• 적정 기준금리 수준을 결정하는 하나의 방법이 테일러준칙이라 합니다
금리인상이 가계와 자영업자에 미치는 영향
• 금리인상으로 가계 이자부담금액이 늘어나게 되었습니다
• 금리인상으로 자영업자 부담도 더 늘어납니다
• 금리가 오르면 가계 전체적으로는 이익입니다
단리와 복리
• 저축은 복리로 해야 합니다
• 72법칙을 알아야 합니다
• 중국이 미국 GDP에 접근해가는 것도 복리의 마법에 있습니다
금리와 채권 가격은 역관계
• 금리가 오르면 채권 가격은 떨어집니다
• 채권의 수요와 공급에 따라 가격과 금리가 결정됩니다
• 금리 하락기에 채권투자를 해야 합니다
금리로 미래의 경제를 예측 — 금리의 기간구조 
• 수익률 곡선은 채권만기에 따른 수익률을 연결한 선입니다
• 장단기 금리차이가 선행지수에 앞서갑니다
• 장단기 금리차로 미래의 경제성장률도 예상해볼 수 있습니다
• 장단기 금리차이 역전은 경기침체를 예고합니다
금리로 금융시장 안정성 판단 — 금리의 위험구조
• 금융시장이 불안하면 위험 프리미엄이 확대됩니다
통화와 금리의 관계 
• 통화 공급이 늘어나면 유동성 효과로 금리가 떨어집니다
• 소득효과와 피셔효과로 금리는 다시 상승합니다
예금금리와 대출금리
• 가중평균금리를 보면 금리 추이를 알 수 있습니다
• 한국은행연합회에서 예금과 대출금리를 비교해줍니다
• 첫째, 대출금리가 어떻게 결정되는 건가요?
• 둘째, 대출금리의 종류는 어떤 것들이 있나요?
• 셋째...

지난 2,000년 사이에 지구의 온도는 1도 정도를 오르내리는 선에서 안정적으로 유지되었다. 덕분에 인류는 살아남아 번영을 구가했고 전 세계 인구는 70억까지 늘어났다. 그러나 지금의 세계는 지구온난화로 인한 기상이변으로 돌이킬 수 없는 타격을 입고 있다. 경제적 측면에서도 위기의 상황에 접어들었다. 

이에 저자는 지금 당장 국가, 기업이 탄소 중심의 경제 체제에서 벗어나 재생에너지, 전기자동차 등 저탄소 경제 체제로 변화하지 않으면 미래는 없다고 단언하고 이미 기후위기를 기회로 만드는 국가와 기업들의 사례를 통해 우리에게 나아가야 할 방향을 제시한다.

존 엘킹턴 지음, 정윤미 옮김 / 더난출판사 / 2021년 12월 / ISBN:9788984054202
정가: 17,000원 / 판매가: 15,300원 / 마일리지: 72원
이벤트: 화제의 책+알라딘 사은품(이벤트 도서 포함, 국내도서 4만원 이상)




회복과 재생을 촉진하는 새로운 미래 자본주의 모델 안내서 《그린 스완》이 출간됐다. 그린 스완은 지난 2007년 뉴욕대학교 교수 나심 니콜라스 탈레브가 제시한 용어 ‘블랙 스완’에서 파생했다. 블랙 스완은 가능성이 극히 적지만, 일단 발생하면 돌이킬 수 없을 정도의 엄청난 충격을 주는 사건을 말한다. 9.11 테러나 2008년 세계 금융위기가 그 대표적인 예다. 그린 스완은 ‘해결책’을 더한, ‘자본시장의 변화를 촉진하는 개념’으로 지속가능성 측면에서 새롭게 정의한 미래 자본주의 모델이라고 할 수 있다. 

이 책은 이미 시작된 ‘변화의 징후’를 읽는 10가지 용어인 목적, 비즈니스 모델, 수익, 성장, 가치, 임팩트, 책임, 중대성, 지배구조, 좌초자산을 통해 세계 경제의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있음을 확인한다. 기업에서 전례가 없는 엄청난 사안에 직면하게 될 때, 종종 ‘사악한 문제’가 발생한다. 예를 들면 담배 회사는 흡연이 수많은 질병을 일으킨다는 것을 알면서도 그 문제를 은폐해왔고, 결국 거대한 액수의 벌금을 선고받아야 했다.

저자가 지적하는 사악한 문제는 크게 다섯 가지다. 플라스틱 쓰레기로 오염된 바다, 살인자 칼로리, 항생제가 초래한 슈퍼버그, 탄소가 급격히 기온을 상승시킨 것, 심각하게 증가한 우주 쓰레기다. 책에서는 이를 해결하기 위한 다섯 가지 패러다임을 짚어내고, 그린 스완의 특성을 지닌 자본주의와 민주주의 그리고 지속가능성을 제시한다. 저자는 세계 기업들에 다음과 같이 엄중하게 윤리성을 촉구한다.

‘공정한 보상’의 저자 신재용 교수는 ‘MZ세대에게 ‘공정’이란 노력에 대한 정당한 대가를 의미하는 매우 실용적인 개념’이라고 말한다. 부도 신분도 대물림되는, 별다른 출구가 없는 이 세대가 살아남기 위해 강조하는 레토릭(rhetoric)이 바로 ‘공정’인 것이다. 

MZ세대는 ‘교환(exchange)’이라는 틀로 세상을 본다. 신재용 교수는 이 책에서 화이트칼라 MZ세대의 특수한 성장배경을 분석하며, 학창시절부터 통과의례처럼 거듭한 토너먼트 경쟁 끝에 현재의 직장에 자리한 이들에게 ‘투입한 노력에 상응하는 대가’를 받는 공정한 교환관계를 유지하는 것이야말로 자신을 지키는 일임을 밝힌다.

01 왜 지금 공정한 보상인가?
공정이 최고의 가치다: 공정성에 민감한 MZ세대의 등장
화이트칼라 MZ세대가 생각하는 공정은 다르다
화이트칼라 MZ세대는 왜 공정한 보상에 더 민감한가?
MZ세대의 토너먼트 연대기
더 이상 비밀은 없다-MZ세대의 소속기반 커뮤니티
왜 갑자기 지금? 최근의 성과급 논란
SK하이닉스 성과급 논란: 이천 쌀집에서는 무슨 일이 있었나?
EVA=영업이익-세금-자본비용

02 무엇이 공정한 보상인가?
보상을 보는 두 가지 이론
기본급 결정을 위한 세 가지 실무
한국기업의 성과급: 인재의 영입, 유지, 동기부여의 도구인가?
한국의 MZ세대 직장인들은 보상을 공정하다고 생각할까?
보상은 무엇에 근거해야 하는가?
공정과 “운”의 필터링
글로벌 기업 CEO 보상을 둘러싼 논쟁
[더 알아보기1] 암젠(Amgen)의 CEO 성과보상 사례
[더 알아보기2] 사회적 가치 혹은 사회성과에 근거한 보상
[더 알아보기3] 넷플릭스 드라마 ‘오징어 게임’에서 나오는 게임들 중 가장 공정한 게임은?

03 성과에 근거한 보상: 성과측정과 인센티브 설계
성과목표는 왜 필요할까?
성과지표의 선정
성과-보상 간 민감도 결정

04 임직원 보상격차
우리 사장님은 얼마 받고 일하실까?
나도 언젠가 그 자리에 올라갈 수 있으니까-토너먼트 이론
임원은 직원의 몇 배를 받아야 할까?
토너먼트 이론과 공정성 이론은 공존할 수 있을까?
중요한 것은 승진가능성!
전무, 상무의 동기부여가 직원보다 더 중요하다

05 어디로 나아갈 것인가? 보다 공정한 보상을 위한 제언
MZ세대의 보상에 대한 요구를 이해하고 제도를 정렬하라
집단을 넘어 개인의 성과로: 역량 있는 관리자의 육성부터 시작하자
평가/보상의 투명성이 중요하다
직급 중심에서 역할 중심으로, 획일적인 보상에서 다양한 보상으로
성장할 수 있는 기회도 보상의 일부다

A recent wave of vertical mergers has reinvigorated the academic and policy debate on enforcement, and the discussion is far from settled. An example of this is that US antitrust authorities presented new vertical merger guidelines in 2020, but the Federal Trade […]

협동조합기본법 시행 10년, ‘협동조합 2만 개 시대’를 맞아 지나온 역사와 현실 상황을 살피고, 한국의 협동조합은 무엇을 해야 할지 모색하며 새로운 대안으로 ‘협동조합 허브론’을 제시한다.

협동조합 운동의 본질은 협동하려는 인간에 대한 신뢰를 바탕으로 자유롭고 평등한 사회를 만들겠다는 인류의 꿈을 실현하는 것이다. 그러나 갈수록 심해지는 불평등과 인류의 존재 자체를 위협하는 기후 위기 앞에서 그 꿈은 닿을 수 없는 이상에 불과한 것 아닌가 하는 회의의 정서가 짙다. 

책은 그런 참혹한 현실을 직시하면서, 그럼에도 불구하고 협동조합만이 할 수 있는 영역이 분명히 있음을 확인한다. 그것은 협동조합이 작은 협동의 경험들을 이어 큰 협동으로 나아가는 접착제 역할을 하고 사회 곳곳을 협동으로 연결하는 허브가 되는 것이다.

김기태, 강민수 두 저자는 한국 협동조합 운동의 산증인으로, 현장은 물론 협동조합 연구 분야에서도 혁혁한 성과를 보여 주었다. 이제 협동조합 허브론이라는 새로운 운동론을 제안하며 40년 전 레이들로가 ICA(국제협동조합연맹) 모스크바 대회에서 제기한 협동조합의 정체성에서 한 걸음 더 나아갈 것을 촉구한다.

북한과 인접한 해안가에는 파도에 떠밀려 온 북한 생활 쓰레기가 가득하다. 이 지역에서 수거한 북한 생활 쓰레기 제품 포장지는 모두 708종의 1,414점이다. 당과류와 음료류는 물론 식품류와 잡화류 그리고 의약품까지 실로 그 종류가 엄청나다. 

자력갱생을 강조하는 북한에서 어떻게 이리도 다양한 상품을 만들어 내는지 그저 의아할 뿐이었다. 그렇게 하나둘 모은 생활 쓰레기는 북한 사회를 읽는 소중한 자료이자 보물이 되었다. 생활쓰레기 포장지는 북한 제품의 브랜드와 디자인, 생산공장 현황 그리고 정치선전을 엿볼 수 있다. 북한사람들의 흔적이 고스란히 담긴 서해안의 <평양마켓>으로 함께 떠나보자.

이언 골딘 외 지음, 권태형 외 옮김 / 동아시아 / 2021년 11월 / ISBN:9788962624045
정가: 32,000원 / 판매가: 28,800원 / 마일리지: 120원
이벤트: 불렛저널 2022 에디션 (대상도서 포함 국내도서 2만원 이상)




옥스퍼드 마틴 스쿨의 창립자이자 세계화 및 국제 개발 분야의 권위자인 이언 골딘과 정치학, 안보학 분야의 석학인 이가라페 연구소의 로버트 머가가 함께 쓴 책이다. 수십 년 간 축적된 연구 및 데이터에 최신의 위성 사진 및 지도 자료를 결합시켰다. 세계화, 기후, 도시화, 불공정, 폭력, 보건, 인구…, 인류가 맞이하고 있는 열네 가지의 중대한 국면을 낱낱이 분석하고 각 현안들을 명쾌한 이미지로 시각화하여 보여준다.

19세기 광고계의 거물이었던 프레드 버나드는 “한 장의 이미지가 천 마디의 말보다 낫다”라는 말을 남겼다. 그 말처럼, 『앞으로 100년』에서 이언 골딘과 로버트 머가가 전하는 메시지는 구체화된 이미지를 통해 사람들에게 가닿는다. 인류가 지구에 어떤 영향을 미치고 있을까? 지금 인류가 지구 위에서 지속 가능한 삶을 꾸려가려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 북극에서 일어나는 화재, 전 세계에서 동시다발적으로 일어나는 해수면의 상승, 이민자에 대한 사람들의 편견과 그 이면의 진실…. 

이 모두를 단순한 말이 아니라 구체적인 이미지로 전달한다. 다양한 방식으로 제작된 100장을 훌쩍 넘어서는 지도와 인포그래픽은 압축적이면서도 설명적이다. 저자들은 때로는 우리의 직관에 어긋나기도 하는 세계의 단면을 냉철하게 제시한다. 그러면서도 그 목소리에는 호소력이 있다. 왜냐면 그들에게는 인류가 맞이한 문제와 앞으로 나아가야 할 방향에 대한 명확한 비전이 있기 때문이다.

저자들이 제시하는 것은 이 지구 위에서 인류가 살아남고, 지속 가능한 삶을 살기 위한 거대한 로드맵이다. 이 책은 인류가 미지의 땅을 헤쳐나가기 위해 집어들어야 할 필수적인 생존 가이드북이다.

모바일과 인터넷을 삶에서 결코 떼어낼 수 없는 젊은 세대이든, 종이 신문이 오히려 익숙한 ‘올드 제너레이션’이든, 하루도 빠짐없이 맞닥뜨리게 되는 언어들이 있다. 많은 이들이 그저 고개를 갸우뚱할 뿐 또렷하게 이해하지 못 하는, 그렇다고 딱히 물어볼 데도 없고 네이버로 검색을 해봐도 속 시원하게 개념이 정리되지도 않아 어정쩡한 채로 머릿속을 맴도는, 저 숱한 경제용어들이 바로 그 언어다. 싹 무시해버릴 수도 없고 그렇다고 들러붙어 공부하기도 쉽지 않은 이 용어들은 대체로 몇 개의 타입으로 나뉜다. 

이해하기 난감한 최신 경제용어 160개를 선정해 제목처럼 ‘명쾌하고 야무지게’ 해설한 책을 독자들에게 제시한다. 단순한 개념 정의는 말할 것도 없거니와, 그 용어가 생겨난 배경이나 경제 환경, 그 용어가 우리의 일상생활, 직장생활, 그리고 투자 활동에 미치게 될 영향이나 충격, 해설을 한층 더 생생하게 만들어주는 실제 기업이나 인물들의 사례, 좀 더 수월한 이해를 도와줄 이미지와 도표와 차트 및 통계치, 향후 경제의 흐름을 어느 정도 예측할 수 있게 도와주는 전문가들의 조언에 이르기까지. 

이 책 한 권이면 골치 아팠던 핵심 경제용어들이 또렷이 이해되어 친하게 다가올 뿐 아니라, 마지막 장을 덮을 때쯤이면 누구나 ‘나름 경제전문가’의 경지에 이를 수 있을 것이다. 물론 현명하고 민첩한 재테크 기술의 습득은 짜릿한 보너스다.
