This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of July 16th, inventory was at 391 thousand (7 day average), compared to 647 thousand the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 39.6%.


A week ago, inventory was at 373 thousand, and was down 43.0% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 27.4% above the record low in early April.

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases, although still well below a normal rate for July.]]></summary>

We start by presenting reduced-form evidence of the effects of trade policy in the presence of supply-chain linkages, on the short-run and persistent effects of trade policy across local labor markets, and on the effects of trade policy uncertainty on employment and firms. We describe the shift-share method for trade policy analysis, discuss the interpretation of the estimated effects, and provide a theoretical foundation. We then describe new quantitative frameworks, methods, and data used to study the aggregate and distributional effects of trade policy in general equilibrium. We discuss how to take into account supply-chain linkages, local labor markets, and different sources of dynamics. As an illustration, we quantify the aggregate and distributional effects of the 2018 trade war between the United States and its trading partners. Finally, we present recent theoretical insights on optimal unilateral trade policy with firm and product heterogeneity in the context of large and small open economies with perfectly and imperfectly competitive product markets. We also discuss how optimal trade policy is shaped by the presence of multiple sectors, intermediate goods, and supply-chain linkages. We close the chapter by discussing the scope of future research.]]></summary>

Using machine learning (ML) algorithms to process full pitch videos, we quantify persuasion in visual, vocal, and verbal dimensions. Positive (i.e., passionate, warm) pitches increase funding probability. Yet conditional on funding, high-positivity startups underperform. Women are more heavily judged on delivery when evaluating single-gender teams, but they are neglected when co-pitching with men in mixed-gender teams.

The increase is driven primarily by vertical (i.e. manager to employee) communication. Greater increases in communication after CEO change are associated with greater increases in firm market returns.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We examine the impact of the opening of a new urgent care center (UCC) on health care costs and the utilization of care among nearby Medicare beneficiaries. We focus on 2006–2016, a period of rapid UCC expansion. We find that total Medicare spending rises when residents of a zip code are first served by a UCC, relative to spending in yet-to-be-served zip codes, while mortality remains flat. We explore mechanisms by looking at categories of spending and by examining utilization. Increases in inpatient visits are the largest contributor to the overall increase in spending, rising by 6.65 percent  within six years after UCC entry. The number of emergency room visits that result in a hospital admission also increases by 3.7 percent. In contrast, there is no change in the number of ER visits that do not result in admission to hospital, in visits to physicians outside a UCC, or in imaging and tests. Overall, these results provide little evidence that UCCs replace costly ER visits or that they crowd out visits to patients' regular doctors. Instead, the evidence is consistent with the possibility that UCCs—which are increasingly owned by or contract with hospital systems—induce greater spending on hospital care.]]></summary>

Inflation rates matter at middle incomes, though Okun’s famous Misery Index only performs well for the top income groups.

We analyze the design of recommendations (available to all market participants) and research reports (available only to subscribers) by a proxy advisor, whose objective is to maximize its profits from selling information to shareholders. We show that even if all shareholders’ interests are aligned and aim at maximizing firm value, the proxy advisor benefits from biasing its recommendations against the a priori more likely alternative. Such recommendations “create controversy” about the vote, increasing the probability that the outcome is close and raising each shareholder's willingness to pay for advice.

We find anxiety, depression and worry peaked in November 2020, coinciding with the Presidential election. The taking of prescription drugs for mental health conditions peaked two weeks later in December 2020. Mental health improved subsequently such that by April 2021 it was better than it had been a year previously. The probability of having been diagnosed with COVID did not rise significantly in the first half of 2021 but COVID infection rates were higher among the young than the old.  COVID diagnoses were significantly lower in States that had voted for Biden in the Presidential Election.  The probability of vaccination rose with age, was considerably higher in Biden states, and rose precipitously over the period among the young and old.  Anxiety was higher among people in Biden states, whether they had been diagnosed or not, and whether they were vaccinated or not.  The association between anxiety and depression and having had COVID was not significant in Biden or Trump states but being vaccinated was associated with lower anxiety and depression, with the effect being larger in Biden states. Whilst being in paid work was associated with lower anxiety, worry and depression and was associated with higher vaccination rates, it also increased the probability of having had COVID.]]></summary>

Individual-level registry data from Denmark show that these disorders carry large earnings penalties, ranging from 34 percent for depression and 38 percent for BD to 74 percent for schizophrenia. To investigate the causal effects of mental health on a person’s career, we exploit the approval of lithium as a maintenance treatment for BD in 1976. Baseline estimates compare career outcomes for people with and without access in their 20s, the typical age of onset for BD. These estimates show that access to treatment eliminates one third of the earnings penalty associated with BD and greatly reduces the risks of low or no earnings. Importantly, access to treatment closes more than half of the disability risk associated with BD.]]></summary>

Life insurers have primarily grown through variable annuities, which are mutual funds with longevity insurance, a potential tax advantage, and minimum return guarantees. The minimum return guarantees change the primary function of life insurers from traditional insurance to financial engineering. Variable annuity insurers are exposed to interest and equity risk mismatch and suffered especially low stock returns during the COVID-19 crisis.

This study combines a large-scale field experiment with a residential sorting model to derive utility-theoretic measures of renter welfare loss associated with the constraints imposed by discrimination in the rental housing market. Results from experiments conducted in five cities show that key neighbor- hood amenities are associated with higher levels of discrimination. Results from the structural model indicate that discrimination imposes costs equivalent to 4.7% of annual income for renters of color, and that search behavior results in greater welfare costs for African Americans as their incomes rise. Renters of color must make substantial investments in additional search to mitigate the costs of these constraints. We find that a naive model ignoring discrimination constraints yields significantly biased estimates of willingness to pay.]]></summary>

Somewhat surprisingly, we find that “soft” news systematically induces viewers to switch away, even more than “hard” news. On the other hand, sensational stories about crime, accidents and disasters are associated with less switching. We also find significant differences in this switching behavior according to gender, age, and the specific TV channel being watched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the COVID-19 epidemic, many health professionals started using mass communication on social media to relay critical information and persuade individuals to adopt preventative health behaviors. Our group of clinicians and nurses developed and recorded short video messages to encourage viewers to stay home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays. We then conducted a two-stage clustered randomized controlled trial in 820 counties (covering 13
States) in the United States of a large-scale Facebook ad campaign disseminating these messages. In the first level of randomization, we randomly divided the counties into two groups: high intensity and low intensity. In the second level, we randomly assigned zip codes to either treatment or control such that 75% of zip codes in high intensity counties received the treatment, while 25% of zip codes in low intensity counties received the treatment. In each treated zip code, we sent the ad to as many Facebook subscribers as possible (11,954,109 users received at least one ad at Thanksgiving and 23,302,290 users received at least one ad at Christmas). The first primary outcome was aggregate holiday travel, measured using mobile phone location data, available at the county level: we find that average distance travelled in high-intensity counties changed by -0.993 percentage points (95% CI -1.616, -0.371, p-value 0.002) the three days before each holiday. The second primary outcome was COVID-19 infection at the zip-code level: COVID-19 infections recorded in the two-week period starting five days post-holiday declined by 3.5 percent (adjusted 95% CI [-6.2 percent, -0.7 percent], p-value 0.013) in intervention zip codes compared to control zip codes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper pushes back against two views about the effects of dollarization. First, there is a view that the dollar is a device by which rich countries provide business cycle insurance to emerging market (EME) countries. We find that the dollar is important for risk sharing, but the evidence suggests that it is primarily a device to shift business cycle risk across different people within individual EMEs and within rich countries rather than across countries. Second, there is a widespread view that dollarization raises the risk of systemic banking and other crises. Although we identify sources of fragility in some aspects of dollarization, the common view that financial dollarization is a source of fragility is over-stated. Our insurance view about financial dollarization and the lack of risks to financial stability emerges from a study of a large cross-country dataset, as well as case studies for Peru and Armenia. We develop a simple model which formalizes the insurance view, which is consistent with the key cross-country facts on interest rate differentials, deposit dollarization and exchange rate depreciations in recessions.]]></summary>

To learn about the effectiveness of such penalties, we examine a U.S. policy restricting passport access for taxpayers with substantial tax debt, known as “certification.” We find an immediate and strong positive effect on compliance actions when a passport request is denied. We then take advantage of randomization during the policy rollout to identify the direct compliance effect of certification, and find smaller but non-trivial effects whose heterogeneity is consistent with measures of taxpayers’ value of having a passport.]]></summary>

We introduce a signaling model in which bride type is imperfectly observed but preferred types have lower returns to delaying marriage. We show that in this environment the market might pool on early marriage even when everyone would benefit from delay. In this setting, offering a small incentive can delay marriage of all treated types and untreated non-preferred types, while programs that act directly on norms can unintentionally encourage early marriage. We test these theoretical predictions by experimentally evaluating a financial incentive to delay marriage alongside a girls’ empowerment program designed to shift norms. As predicted, girls eligible for the incentive are 19% less likely to marry underage, as are nonpreferred type women ineligible for the incentive. Meanwhile, the empowerment program was successful in promoting more progressive gender norms but failed to decrease adolescent marriage and increased dowry payments.]]></summary>

We demonstrate that the distribution generating this randomness is fundamentally not identifiable from location choice data and as a result the optimal allocation as chosen by a social planner is not identified.  We propose an algorithm for setting the distribution generating the random utility across locations that implies a planner will optimally choose no redistribution in the absence of externalities or equity motives between different groups of people.  Our algorithm preserves a planner's motives to redistribute due to equity considerations between different types of people and efficiency in production, the focus of many recent studies.]]></summary>

Given secular increases in job utility, work hours per population can remain approximately constant over time even if the income effect of higher wages on labor supply exceeds the substitution effect. In addition, secular improvements in job utility can be substantial relative to welfare gains from ordinary technological progress. These two implications are connected by an equation flowing from optimal hours choices: improvements in job utility that have a significant effect on labor supply tend to have large welfare effects.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early tests of cross-country convergence found evidence only for conditional convergence. In contrast, with more recent data, Kremer, Willis, and You (2021) find evidence that since the mid-1980s there has been a trend towards unconditional convergence culminating in absolute convergence since 2000. Additionally, they find suggestive evidence that one of the major drivers of this trend is an underlying convergence towards development-favored policies. We discuss the implications of this result through the lens of individual welfare and poverty, concluding that the news is not as welcome as it may seem for the world’s poor. We point out that absolute convergence has happened contemporaneously with rising within-country inequality, resulting in more of the world’s poor living in middle-income countries. Next, we argue that domestic redistribution is essential to spread the benefits from industrialization, since the labor share of manufacturing isn’t reaching the heights it did in industrialized countries. Finally, we argue that the democratic institutions that can facilitate this redistribution themselves face headwinds. Democratic backsliding, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a bleak climate outlook all present obstacles to transforming economic growth into economic justice for the poor.]]></summary>

Opponents argue that RML-induced increases in marijuana consumption will serve as a “gateway” to harder drug use and crime. Using data covering the period 2000-2019 from a variety of national sources (the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the Uniform Crime Reports, the National Vital Statistics System, and the Treatment Episode Data Set) this study is the first to comprehensively examine the effects of legalizing recreational marijuana on hard drug use, arrests, drug overdose deaths, suicides, and treatment admissions. Our analyses show that RMLs increase adult marijuana use and reduce drug-related arrests over an average post-legalization window of three to four years. There is little evidence to suggest that RML-induced increases in marijuana consumption encourage the use of harder substances or violent criminal activity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Post 9/11 GI Bill (PGIB) is among the largest and most generous college subsidies enacted thus far in the U.S. We examine the impact of the PGIB on veterans’ college-going, degree completion, federal education tax benefit utilization, and long run earnings. Among veterans potentially induced to enroll, the introduction of the PGIB raised college enrollment by 0.17 years and B.A. completion by 1.2 percentage points (on a base of 9 percent). But, the PGIB reduced average annual earnings nine years after separation from the Army by $900 (on a base of $32,000). Years enrolled effects are larger and earnings effects more negative for veterans with lower AFQT scores and those who were less occupationally skilled. Under a variety of conservative assumptions, veterans are unlikely to recoup these reduced earnings during their working careers.  All veterans who were already enrolled in college at the time of bill passage increase their months of schooling, but only for those in public institutions did this translate into increases in bachelor’s degree attainment and longer-run earnings. For specific groups of students, large subsidies can modestly help degree completion but harm long run earnings due to lost labor market experience.]]></summary>

To answer this question, we introduce a unified model that integrates notions of both taste-based and statistical discrimination into a task-based model of occupational sorting. At the heart of our framework is the idea that discrimination varies by the task requirement of each job.  We use this framework to identify and quantify the role of trends in race-specific factors and changing task prices in explaining the evolution of the Black-White wage gap since 1960.  In doing so, we highlight a new task measure - Contact tasks – which measures the extent to which individuals interact with others as part of their job.  We provide evidence that changes in the racial gap in Contact tasks serves as a good proxy for changes in taste-based discrimination over time.  We find that taste-based discrimination has fallen and racial skill gaps have narrowed over the last sixty years in the United States. However, since the 1980s, the effect of declining racial skill gaps and discrimination on the Black-White wage gap were offset by the increasing returns to Abstract tasks which, on average, favored White workers relative to Black workers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interactions between redistributive policies can confront low-income households with complicated choices.  We study one such interaction, namely the relationship between Medicaid eligibility thresholds and the minimum wage.  A minimum wage increase reduces the number of hours a low-skilled individual can work while retaining Medicaid eligibility.  We show that the empirical and welfare implications of this interaction can depend crucially on the relevance of labor market frictions.  Absent frictions, affected workers may maintain Medicaid eligibility through small reductions in hours of work.  With frictions, affected workers may lose Medicaid eligibility unless they leave their initial job.  Empirically, we find that workers facing this scenario became less likely to participate in Medicaid, less likely to work, and more likely to spend time looking for new jobs, including search while employed.  The observed outcomes suggest that low-skilled workers face substantial labor market frictions.  Because adjustment is costly, tinkering with safety net program parameters that determine the location of program eligibility notches can be harmful to beneficiaries.]]></summary>

This column argues that some central banks in Latin American and Caribbean went beyond accommodating the increased demand for liquidity, inducing monetary injections that then returned through excess bank reserves and sterilisation liabilities for those central banks that fixed an interest rate, and through sales of international reserves for those that favoured stable exchange rates.

• Schedule for Week of July 18, 2021
Monday:
• At 10:00 AM ET, the July NAHB homebuilder survey. The consensus is for a reading of 82, up from 81. Any number above 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good than poor.
From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&P 500 are down 5 and DOW futures are down 65 (fair value).
Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $71.61 per barrel and Brent at $73.27 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $41, and Brent was at $43 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 75% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From housing economist Tom Lawler (see important comments on inventory):
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.79 million in June, down 0.2% from May’s preliminary pace and up 21.4% from last June’s seasonally adjusted pace.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that while the inventory of existing homes for sale remained very low last month, inventories on the month increased by significantly more than the seasonal norm, and the YOY decline in June was significantly less than in May.  What this means for the NAR’s inventory estimate for June, however, in unclear.  As I’ve noted before, the inventory measure in most publicly-released local realtor/MLS reports excludes listings with pending contracts, but that is not the case for most of the reports sent to the NAR (referred to as the “NAR Report!”),  Since the middle of last Spring inventory measures excluding pending listings have fallen much more sharply than inventory measures including such listings, and this latter inventory measure understates the decline in the effective inventory of homes for sale over the last several months.  Having said that, however, it appears as if seasonally adjusted inventories are now on the rise.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 21% from last June.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release June existing home sales on Thursday, July 22, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 5.90 million SAAR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of July 13th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearance Volumes Essentially Flat This Week
After last week’s roughly 190,000 reduction in the number of active forbearance plans, a decline of just 1,000 plans may feel miniscule.
It may indeed be, but it’s also very much in line with what we’ve seen month after month since the recovery began – namely, the well-documented, mid-month lull in activity. 
As of July 13, 1.86 million borrowers remain in COVID-19 forbearance plans, making up 3.5% of all active mortgages and 2.1% of GSE, 6.2% of FHA/VA and 4.0% of Portfolio/PLS loans.
 What little weekly improvement was seen was found among FHA/VA forbearance plans (-5,000). This was partially offset by a 4,000 rise among portfolio/PLS forbearances while at the same time plan volumes among GSE loans held steady from last week.
  
Click on graph for larger image.
  
All in, this puts the number of loans in active forbearance down 196,000 (-9.5%) from the same time last month. With nearly 400,000 plans still scheduled to be reviewed for extension/removal this month, there is still a chance for moderate recovery towards the end of this month and the beginning of August.
Removal volumes returned to mid-June levels as the number of loans being reviewed for extension/removal trailed off after the first week of the month, while plan starts edged higher, driven by an increase in restart activity.
  
This too is a familiar phenomenon; one we’ve seen following large volumes of quarterly plan reviews over the course of the pandemic. As in the past, the increase in restarts is most likely a counter to last week’s large number of exits.

더욱 구체적인 사례 중심의 실무서. 추상적인 이론과 실제 M&A 및 LBO 사례를 연결해 실무에 당장 활용할 수 있도록 해준다. 성공적인 M&A, LBO 투자의 실질적 경제성을 수학적·재무적으로 분석하게끔 알려준다. 각종 회계·재무분석의 이론을 알아도, 이를 엑셀 프로그램을 사용해 실제 밸류에이션 모델까지 구축해 분석하기는 어려운 것이 현실인데, 이 책은 구체적인 사례 중심의 설명들로 그 방법을 속 시원히 알려준다. 그 어디에서도 알려주지 않는, 현업 실무자들만이 알고 있는 내용이다. 

사모펀드 조성 및 기업 투자 절차와 부록에 소개한 S&P Capital IQ의 구체적인 사용방법 등, 업계 전반적인 생태에 대한 이해뿐 아니라 실무진 레벨에서 사용하는 유용한 분석 도구 활용 역시 두루 설명하고 있다. 이번 개정판에서는 실제 사례 중심의 추가로 더욱 이해가 쉽도록 도와주고 있다. 광범위하고 다양한 알짜배기 내용을 많이 포함하고 있어 금융계 입성을 꿈꾸는 대학생부터 M&A 업무에 관한 좀 더 전문적인 지식 습득을 원하는 직장인 모두에게 최고의 선택이 될 것이다.

This column argues that the review constitutes a mixed bag. The asymmetry of the inflation target, a long standing source of ambiguity and potential policy mistakes, has been corrected by announcing a symmetric central target at 2%. But major ambiguities remain concerning the width of the tolerance band around 2%, the definition of the relevant price index, the interpretation of the inflation process, and the way monetary policy is prepared to team-up with fiscal authorities to preserve the euro’s stability going forward. All in all, the glass remains half-empty and the water it contains is somewhat muddy.]]></summary>

And yet, fewer firms declared bankruptcy during the pandemic than in preceding years. This column introduces a model designed to examine the economic impact of Covid-19. It determines that government assistance rescued previously profitable firms that might not have survived lockdowns, but also propped up weaker firms that would have failed in normal times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: I'm tracking data for many local markets around the U.S. I think it is especially important to watch inventory this year.
From SacRealtor.org: Sacramento County median sales price reaches $520,000
June closed ended with 1,723 sales, an 11.9% increase from May (1,540). Compared to one year ago (1,506), the current figure is up 14.4%.. 
...
The Active Listing Inventory increased 2.4% from May to June, from 1,267 units to 1,297 units. Compared with June 2020 (1,495), inventory is down 13.2%.
  
The Months of Inventory remained at .8 Months. This figure represents the amount of time (in months) it would take for the current rate of sales to deplete the total active listing inventory.
emphasis added 
Note that inventory in June was up 2.4% from last month, and up 76% from the record low in January 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation's container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was up 1.5% in June compared to the rolling 12 months ending in May.   Outbound traffic was down 0.5% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports.
Imports were up 23% YoY in June (collapsed last year due to pandemic), and exports were down 6.2% YoY.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 9.3% compared to the same week in 2019.

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Occupancy Improves; Average Daily Rate Sets New Record
U.S. hotel occupancy improved week over week, while average daily rate (ADR) was the highest on record, according to STR‘s latest data through July 10.
July 4-10, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 67.2% (-9.3%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$139.84 (+5.4%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$93.99 (-4.4%)
 Inflation aside, STR analysts note that hoteliers are taking advantage of pent-up leisure demand and higher spending travelers while trying to counter staffing shortages and rising operational costs in some regions. Additionally, with demand mostly transient, there is not the usual lowering effect of discounted group rates at the higher end of the market. Most of the higher ADR performances are outside of the major metro markets.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months should have decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the Fed: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in June after moving up 0.7 percent in May. In June, manufacturing output edged down 0.1 percent, as an ongoing shortage of semiconductors contributed to a decrease of 6.6 percent in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory output increased 0.4 percent. The output of utilities advanced 2.7 percent, reflecting heightened demand for air conditioning, as much of the country experienced a heat wave in June. The index for mining increased 1.4 percent.
For the second quarter as a whole, total industrial production rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent. Manufacturing output increased at an annual rate of 3.7 percent despite a drop of 22.5 percent for motor vehicles and parts.
  
At 100.1 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production in June was 9.8 percent above its year-earlier level but 1.2 percent below its pre-pandemic (February 2020) level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose 0.3 percentage point in June to 75.4 percent, a rate that is 4.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Police body-worn cameras (BWCs) have been the subject of much research on how the technology’s enhanced documentation of police/citizen interactions impact police behavior. Less attention has been paid to how BWC recordings affect the adjudication of citizen complaints against the police. We employ citizen complaint data from the Chicago Police Department and Civilian Office of Police Accountability filed between 2012-2020 to determine the extent to which BWC footage enhances the efficacy of evidence used to formulate a conclusion of responsibility, and whether bias against complainants based on race would subsequently be reduced. Accordingly, we exploit the staggered deployment of BWCs across 22 Chicago police districts over time to estimate the effect of BWCs on these outcomes. Our findings indicate that BWCs led to a significant decrease in the dismissal of investigations due to insufficient evidence ("not sustained") as well as a significant increase in disciplinary actions against police officers ("sustained" outcomes”) with sufficient evidence to sanction their misconduct. We further find that disparities in complaints across racial groups for the “unsustained” category fade away with the implementation of BWCs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modernization theory is a cornerstone of much of political science, despite the mounting evidence against its predictions. In this paper, we argue that the theory's failings are rooted in predictions that are not conditioned on history and cultural configurations. We outline a theory in which the interplay of the distribution of political power and cultural configurations lead to three distinct self-reinforcing paths of political development, with very different state-society relations, institutions, and economic structures. These are paths to Despotic, Absent and Shackled leviathans. The role of cultural configurations, made up of attributes in a society's culture set, is critical in legitimizing the social arrangements in each path. For example, a Despotic Leviathan, as in China, cannot be understood without appreciating how Confucian culture has been used to bolster a worldview in which rulers are supposed to be virtuous and regular people are discouraged from political participation. We argued that this interpretation is not inherent to Confucian thought, but has to be understood as an endogenous outcome along the trajectory to the Despotic Leviathan. None of the three different paths we highlight support modernization theory. Under the Absent Leviathan, there is no economic modernization. Under the Despotic Leviathan, economic growth bolsters the existing regime and its supporting cultural configuration, with no tendency towards democracy or associate political changes. Under the Shackled Leviathan, there are dynamics leading to economic growth and political changes with greater bottom-up participation. Nevertheless, the causation does not go from the former to the latter, and these changes are critically dependent on cultural and political entrepreneurship in order to formulate and popularize new cultural configurations and institutionalize political changes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We argue that alternative COVID-19 vaccine dosing regimens could potentially dramatically accelerate global COVID-19 vaccination and reduce mortality, and that the costs of testing these regimens are dwarfed by their potential benefits. We first use the high correlation between neutralizing antibody response and efficacy against disease (Khoury et. al. 2021) to show that half or even quarter doses of some vaccines generate immune responses associated with high vaccine efficacy. We then use an SEIR model to estimate that under these efficacy levels, doubling or quadrupling the rate of vaccination by using fractional doses would dramatically reduce infections and mortality. Since the correlation between immune response and efficacy may not be fully predictive of efficacy with fractional doses, we then use the SEIR model to show that fractional dosing would substantially reduce infections and mortality over a wide range of plausible efficacy levels. Further immunogenicity studies for a range of vaccine and dose combinations could deliver outcomes in weeks and could be conducted with a few hundred healthy volunteers. National regulatory authorities could also decide to test efficacy of fractional dosing in the context of vaccination campaigns based on existing immune response data, as some did for delayed second doses. If efficacy turned out to be high, the approach could be implemented broadly, while if it turned out to be low, downside risk could be limited by administering full doses to those who had received fractional doses. The SEIR model also suggests that delaying second vaccine doses will likely have substantial mortality benefits for multiple, but not all, vaccine-variant combinations, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance. Finally, we find that for countries choosing between approved but lower efficacy vaccines available immediately and waiting for mRNA vaccines, using immediately available vaccines typically reduces mortality.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platforms are growing increasingly powerful, raising questions about whether their power might be exercised with bias. While bias is inherently difficult to measure, we identify a context within the music industry that is amenable to bias testing. Our approach requires ex ante platform assessments of commercial promise - such as the rank order in which products are presented - along with information on eventual product success. A platform is biased against a product type if the type attains greater success, conditional on ex ante assessment. Theoretical considerations and voiced industry concerns suggest the possibility of platform biases in favor of major record labels, and industry participants also point to bias against women. Using data on Spotify curators' rank of songs on New Music Friday playlists in 2017, we find that Spotify's New Music Friday rankings favor independent-label music, along with some evidence of bias in favor of music by women. Despite challenges that independent-label artists and women face in the music industry, Spotify's New Music curation appears to favor them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We offer a novel test of whether an asset pricing model describes expected returns in the absence of mispricing.  Our test assumes such a model assigns zero alpha to investment strategies using decade-old information. The CAPM satisfies this condition, but prominent multifactor models do not.  While multifactor betas help capture current expected returns on mispriced stocks, persistence in those betas distorts the stocks' implied expected returns after prices correct. These results are most evident in large-cap stocks, whose multifactor betas are the most persistent.  Hence, prominent multifactor models distort expected returns, absent mispricing, for even the largest, most liquid stocks.]]></summary>

We study these entrepôts, the network they form, and their impact on international trade.

We estimate indirect-shipping consistent trade costs using a model where shipments can be sent indirectly through an endogenous transport network and develop a geography-based instrument to estimate economies of scale in shipping.

In the past two decades, the Southern Resident Killer whales (SRKW) have declined by more than 25 percent, and this population appears on a slow-motion path towards extinction.  This paper combines elements from biology and economics to put forward a new methodology for investigating their collapse and presents empirical work supporting its novel explanation - the Orca Conjecture.  The key mechanism is ecological - Gause's law of competitive exclusion - combined with a shock coming from booming trade with Asia. Using three different empirical methods drawn from economics, I find the attendant noise disturbance from increased ship traffic post-1998 has lowered births and raised deaths significantly, placing the SRKW on a slow-motion path towards extinction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We estimate an equilibrium model of residential sorting with endogenous traffic congestion to evaluate the efficiency and equity impacts of urban transportation policies.  Leveraging fine-scale data on household travel diaries and housing transactions with home and work locations in Beijing, we jointly estimate travel mode and residential location decisions. The estimation highlights the importance of incorporating work commute in housing decisions and features preference heterogeneity for the ease of work commute by gender. Counterfactual simulations show that while different policies can attain the same level of congestion reduction, their impacts on residential sorting and social welfare are drastically different. First, a driving restriction intensifies income-stratified urban structure where high-income households live closer to subway and work. Distance-based congestion pricing reduces the spatial separation between residence and workplace across income levels, while subway expansion does the opposite. Second,  residential sorting strengthens the effectiveness of congestion pricing in improving traffic conditions but undermines that of the driving restriction and subway expansion. Third, the driving restriction is welfare reducing as it leads to large distortions on travel choices. Congestion pricing improves welfare but is regressive, highlighting the need to recycle revenue to address the associated equity concern. Finally, congestion pricing and subway expansion when combined deliver the largest congestion relief and efficiency gain and at the same time achieve self-financing, with revenue from congestion pricing fully covering the cost of subway expansion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use stock exchange message data to quantify the negative aspect of high-frequency trading, known as “latency arbitrage.” The key difference between message data and widely-familiar limit order book data is that message data contain attempts to trade or cancel that fail. This allows the researcher to observe both winners and losers in a race, whereas in limit order book data you cannot see the losers, so you cannot directly see the races. We find that latency-arbitrage races are very frequent (about one per minute per symbol for FTSE 100 stocks), extremely fast (the modal race lasts 5-10 millionths of a second), and account for a remarkably large portion of overall trading volume (about 20%). Race participation is concentrated, with the top 6 firms accounting for over 80% of all race wins and losses. The average race is worth just a small amount (about half a price tick), but because of the large volumes the stakes add up. Our main estimates suggest that races constitute roughly one-third of price impact and the effective spread (key microstructure measures of the cost of liquidity), that latency arbitrage imposes a roughly 0.5 basis point tax on trading, that market designs that eliminate latency arbitrage would reduce the market's cost of liquidity by 17%, and that the total sums at stake are on the order of $5 billion per year in global equity markets alone.]]></summary>

We use data on repeated interactions between a large sample of U.S. physicians and many different insurers to document the complexity of healthcare billing, and estimate its economic costs for doctors and consequences for patients.  Observing the back-and-forth sequences of claims' denials and resubmissions for past visits, we can estimate physicians' costs of haggling with insurers to collect payments.  Combining these costs with the revenue never collected, we estimate that physicians lose 17% of Medicaid revenue to billing problems, compared with 5% for Medicare and 3% for commercial payers.  Identifying off of physician movers and practices that span state boundaries, we find that physicians respond to billing problems by refusing to accept Medicaid patients in states with more severe billing hurdles.  These hurdles are just as quantitatively important  as payment rates for explaining variation in physicians' willing to treat Medicaid patients.  We conclude that administrative frictions have first-order costs for doctors, patients, and equality of access to healthcare.]]></summary>

We exploit a dataset combining Gallup World Polls and Global Findex surveys for some 250,000 individuals in 140 countries, merging them with information on the incidence of epidemics and local 3G internet infrastructure. Epidemic exposure is associated with an increase in remote-access (online/mobile) banking and substitution from bank branch-based to ATM-based activity. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we show that heterogeneity in this response centers on the age, income and employment of respondents. Young, high-income earners in full-time employment have the greatest propensity to shift to online/mobile transactions in response to epidemics. These effects are larger for individuals in subnational regions with better ex ante 3G signal coverage, highlighting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies voting in shareholders meetings. We focus on the informational efficiency of different voting mechanisms, taking into account that they affect both management's incentives before the meeting and shareholders' decisions at the meeting. We first focus on the case in which the management does not affect the proposal being voted on. We prove that, for any distribution of shareholdings, the one-share-one-vote mechanism (1S1V) dominates the one-person-one-vote mechanism (1P1V), independently of whether or how shareholdings correlate with information accuracy. We also show that 1S1V becomes efficient only if votes are fully divisible. Second, we consider the case in which the management decides whether to put the proposal to a vote. The properties of a voting mechanism then depend both on its voting efficiency and on how it affects managers' incentives to select good proposals. We uncover a trade-off between selection and voting efficiency underlying the comparison of 1S1V and 1P1V: the higher voting efficiency of 1S1V implies worse selection incentives. In some cases, the negative effect of worse selection incentives on shareholders' welfare can be large enough to wash out the higher voting efficiency of 1S1V.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Estimation and testing of factor models in asset pricing requires choosing a set of test assets. The choice of test assets determines how well different factor risk premia can be identified: if only few assets are exposed to a factor, that factor is weak, which makes standard estimation and inference incorrect. In other words, the strength of a factor is not an inherent property of the factor: it is a property of the cross-section used in the analysis. We propose a novel way to select assets from a universe of test assets and estimate the risk premium of a factor of interest, as well as the entire stochastic discount factor, that explicitly accounts for weak factors and test assets with highly correlated risk exposures. We refer to our methodology as supervised principal component analysis (SPCA), because it iterates an asset selection step and a principal-component estimation step. We provide the asymptotic properties of our estimator, and compare its limiting behavior with that of alternative estimators proposed in the recent literature, which rely on PCA, Ridge, Lasso, and Partial Least Squares (PLS). We find that the SPCA is superior in the presence of weak factors, both in theory and in finite samples. We illustrate the use of SPCA by applying it to estimate the risk premia of several tradable and nontradable factors, to evaluate asset managers’ performance, and to de-noise asset pricing factors.]]></summary>

The model suggests that the recovery since the start of the pandemic has been slower than raw data suggest and finds evidence of favourable foreign demand and container market shocks.]]></summary>

Using data from a Chinese online job portal, this column documents how firms facing US tariff increases during the recent trade war posted fewer jobs and offered lower salaries, among other adjustments. Chinese retaliatory tariffs have not induced any systematic adjustments in firms’ vacancy postings. The winners of the trade war remain elusive while losers can be found on both sides.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm gathering existing home data for many local markets, and I'm watching inventory very closely this year.

The table below shows some preliminary data for June (more to come).
As I noted in Some thoughts on Housing Inventory 
The key for housing in 2021 will be inventory. If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in house prices. However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.
Although inventory in these areas is down about 44% year-over-year, inventory is up 13% month-to-month.  Seasonally we'd usually expect an increase in inventory from May to June - so this increase is probably seasonal (as opposed to a shift in the market).   

It does appear inventory bottomed seasonally in March.

Houston real estate held to record territory in June with buyers continuing to seize upon historically low interest rates as they purchased homes from among a limited supply. Despite the strong buying activity, the pace was slightly slower in the year-over-year comparison.
  
  According to the latest Houston Association of Realtors (HAR) Market Update, single-family homes sales were up 13.6 percent compared to last June, with 10,638 units sold versus 9,362 a year earlier. That becomes the market’s thirteenth consecutive positive month of sales. On a year-to-date basis, home sales remain 25.9 percent ahead of 2020’s record pace.

From Fed Chair Powell: Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  An excerpt on inflation: 
Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BLS reported yesterday morning:
The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) increased 6.1 percent over the last 12 months to an index level of 266.412 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index rose 1.1 percent prior to seasonal adjustment.
CPI-W is the index that is used to calculate the Cost-Of-Living Adjustments (COLA). The calculation dates have changed over time (see Cost-of-Living Adjustments), but the current calculation uses the average CPI-W for the three months in Q3 (July, August, September) and compares to the average for the highest previous average of Q3 months. Note: this is not the headline CPI-U, and is not seasonally adjusted (NSA).
• In 2020, the Q3 average of CPI-W was 253.412.
The 2020 Q3 average was the highest Q3 average, so we only have to compare Q3 this year to last year.
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows CPI-W since January 2000. The red lines are the Q3 average of CPI-W for each year.
Note: The year labeled for the calculation, and the adjustment is effective for December of that year (received by beneficiaries in January of the following year).
CPI-W was up 6.1% year-over-year in June, and although this is very early - we need the data for July, August and September - my current guess is COLA will probably be around 5.5% this year, the largest increase since 5.8% in 2008 - and it is possible this will be the largest increase since 1982 (7.4%).
Contribution and Benefit Base
The contribution base will be adjusted using the National Average Wage Index. This is based on a one year lag. The National Average Wage Index is not available for 2020 yet, but wages probably increased again in 2020. If wages increased the same as in 2019, then the contribution base next year will increase to around $148,200 in 2022, from the current $142,800.
Remember - this is an early look.  What matters is average CPI-W, NSA, for all three months in Q3 (July, August and September).]]></summary>

경제학은 무미건조하다. 이것이 사람들이 경제학을 바라보는 시선이다. 그러나 무미건조한 경제학의 겉모습은 위장에 불과하다. 돈 버는 학문을 넘어서 경제학은 인간에 대한 학문이다. 제한된 자원으로 인간의 무한한 필요와 욕구를 충족시키는 방법을 연구하는 것이 경제학이다. 

이렇듯 어렵고 냉정해보이기만한 경제학을 《하루 3분, 생각의 깊이를 더하는 경제학 100문장》에서는 100개의 유명하고 영감을 줄 수 있는 명언들을 연대기 순으로 정리했다. 경제학의 역사와 함께 주요 개념과 이론에 대해 설명한다. 이를 통해 경제학이 ‘인간의 일상생활을 연구하는 학문’이라는 경제학자 마셜의 말을 다시금 깨달을 수 있을 것이다. 

세상에 존재하는 다양한 경제이론들을 100개의 인용문들로 완벽히 설명할 수는 없을 것이다. 하지만 이 책은 경제학이 무엇인지 전반적인 개요를 설명함으로써 경제학에 대한 편견을 깨는 것에 목적이 있다. 또한 명언들의 의미를 직관적으로 파악할 수 있도록 다양한 이미지들과 그래프들이 함께 소개되고 있다는 것이 이 책의 가장 큰 매력이다. 어렵게만 느껴졌던 경제학에 한 발 가까이 갈 수 있는 좋은 경제학 입문서가 될 것이다.

At the same time, income inequality across households has increased in recent decades. This column finds that the interaction of the marriage market and the labour market crucially impacts inequality across gender and within/between households. Policies that affect who marries whom (such as tax policies) or home production choices (such as parental leave or universal childcare) can mitigate or amplify inequality, calling for a better understanding of these spillovers across markets.]]></summary>

This column presents model- and survey-based estimates which suggest that global inflation will rise by about 1-1.4 percentage points this year, pushing it above target in about half of inflation-targeting emerging market and developing economies. This may not be reason for concern provided the increase is temporary and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.

I'm looking at data for some second home markets - and will track those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through June 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.

Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Note that inventory was high while prices were declining - and significantly lower inventory in 2012 suggested the bust was over.  (Tracking inventory helped me call the bottom for housing way back in February 2012, see:The Housing Bottom is Here)
Currently inventory is still very low, but solidly above the record low set three months ago, and prices are up sharply YoY.   This will be interesting to watch.]]></summary>

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.9 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.6 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. This was the largest 1-month change since June 2008 when the index rose 1.0 percent. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.4 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending August 2008.
  
The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 10.5 percent in June. This increase accounted for more than one-third of the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.8 percent in June, a larger increase than the 0.4-percent increase reported for May. The energy index increased 1.5 percent in June, with the gasoline index rising 2.5 percent over the month.
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.9 percent in June after increasing 0.7 percent in May. Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel. The index for medical care and the index for household furnishings and operations were among the few major component indexes which decreased in June.
The all items index rose 5.4 percent for the 12 months ending June; it has been trending up every month since January, when the 12-month change was 1.4 percent. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.5 percent over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1991. The energy index rose 24.5 percent over the last 12-months, and the food index increased 2.4 percent.

We closed out last week on a fence about the short term outlook for rates.  On the one hand, Friday was fairly weak.  On the other hand that weakness followed 3 great days of gains and could furthermore be rationalized as defensive positioning ahead of early risks in the week ahead.  We made it through half of those risks on Monday (3 and 10yr Treasury auction) with minimal damage, but certainly no major gains.  As such, bonds look like they're keeping their options open for now.  We hope to get a better lay of the land after tomorrow's events (CPI and 30yr bond auction).  [30 year fixed 3.09%]

지구가 몸살을 앓고 있다. 빙하의 해빙뿐 아니라 폭염과 폭설, 산불, 허리케인 등 이상기후 현상이 세계 곳곳에서 일어나고 있다. 이 모든 것이 지구온난화로 인해 벌어진 현상이다. 지구온난화의 주범으로 지목되는 온실가스, 이를 해결하기 위해 세계는 ‘탄소제로’를 선언했다. 지금까지 사용해오던 화석연료에서 벗어나 그린 에너지로의 전환에 모든 기업이 주목하고 있다. 이러한 ‘그린 혁명’의 흐름에 우리 기업들은 어떻게 준비하고 있을까? 

이 책은 수소경제를 비롯해 재생에너지, 에코 모빌리티 등 탈탄소 시대에 우리가 주목해야 할 미래 산업을 소개한다. 이와 함께 세계 경제가 친환경 에너지 산업으로 빠르게 이동하는 과정과 현대자동차, 한국전력, SK이노베이션, 현대중공업, 롯데케미칼, 두산퓨얼셀, SK가스, 고려아연 등 한국 대표 기업들이 이러한 변화에 어떻게 대응하고 있는지 짚어본다.

역사와 현실을 종횡무진하며 다양한 규제의 세목과 그 이면들을 살핀다. 수백 년 역사를 넘나들며, 미국, 영국, 프랑스부터 루마니아, 리비아, 베네수엘라, 그리고 대한민국까지 세계 각지의 엉뚱하고 황당한 규제 정책들을 다룬다. ‘하룻밤에 읽는 규제의 역사’라 할 정도로 사례들 하나하나가 흥미진진하다.

가상화폐, 코인 시장이 무섭게 흔들리고 있다. 2020년 하반기부터 시작된 맹렬한 상승세에, 2021년 4월에 7만 달러를 넘보던 비트코인이 6월 들어 3만 달러 밑으로까지 떨어지며 요동쳤다. 중국이 채굴장을 폐쇄하고 각국 정부가 규제책을 내놓으면서 ‘코인 시장은 끝났다’는 자조도 나온다. 그런가 하면 돈나무 언니로 불리는 캐시 우드(아크 인베스트먼트 CEO)를 위시로 한 투자자들은 ‘비트코인 50만 달러 간다’면서 ‘떨어질 때가 오히려 사야 할 적기’라고 호언한다. 평범한 투자자로선 불안하기 짝이 없다. 

지금 코인에 투자해도 되는지, 어떤 코인에 투자해야 하는지 혼란스럽다. 수백 배씩 오르며 ‘돈 복사기’로 불렸던 알트코인조차 거래소가 연이어 상장폐지하면서 폭락한다. 상승과 하락 폭이 너무도 커서 시장에 대응하는 게 위태롭고 초조하다. 

그러나 변덕스런 도박판으로 치부하기에는 가상자산 시장은 이미 너무 커져 버렸다. 각국이 중앙은행 디지털 화폐(CBDC)를 속속 도입하고, 코인 비즈니스 모델은 모든 첨단 산업(메타버스, 게임, 플랫폼)과 연결되기에 미래가치가 무궁무진하다. 무작정 무시하기엔 가능성이 너무 큰 시장이다. 3년 전 1차 코인붐이 꺼질 때 코인 시장이 망할 거라 비웃던 이들은 어떻게 되었나? 2020년 눈앞에 펼쳐진 …]]></summary>

This column argues that rather than rising demand for opioids for relief from pain or despair, it is supply-side innovations in the legal and illegal drug markets that have been the main driver of the opioid epidemic. The opioid cycle is a cautionary tale about how technological innovation can go terribly awry, and calls for more collective scepticism about innovations that allegedly cleanse pleasure-inducing drugs of their addictive properties as well as stronger penalties for companies that mislead the public about the risks of their products.]]></summary>

지난 30여 년간 6번의 정권이 바뀌는 동안, 그 어떤 정부도 말하지 않은 ‘한국 경제 불변의 법칙’이 있다. 경제의 진짜 성장능력을 나타내는 장기성장률이 1990년대 초 이후 매 5년마다 1%포인트씩 미끄럼틀 타듯이 지속적으로 추락해온 ‘한국 경제 5년 1% 하락의 법칙’이 그것이다. 

이 암울한 법칙은 매우 강력하여 보수, 진보 정권에 상관없이 그 위력을 발휘해왔을 뿐만 아니라, 2003년 사스, 2015년 메르스 등 전염병 사태가 발발하고 1997년 외환위기, 2008년 글로벌 금융위기 등 경제위기가 있었지만 이 위기들 이전과 이후 상관없이 한국 경제를 주도해왔다. 

그럼에도 어떤 정부도 지속적 경제 하락 추세를 국민들에게 알리지 않았고, 표를 얻기 위해 ‘신기루 경제정책’을 펼치고도 정권을 잡았다. 그런 다음 임기 동안 단기적 성장률을 높이는 데만 집중하며 경기부양정책을 펼쳐왔다. 고통스러운 제로성장의 도래를 그 다음 정부로 떠넘기고자 ‘폭탄 돌리기’를 지속해온 것이다.

저자인 서울대학교 경제학부 김세직 교수는 첫 단독저서 『모방과 창조』를 통해 한국 경제에 이 퇴행의 법칙이 계속 작동하면 향후 장기성장률이 0%대의 제로성장에 처해 디스토피아적 상황을 맞이하게 됨을 강력히 경고한다. 소득의 극심한 감소를 피하기 위해서는, 하루 빨리 추…]]></summary>

우리는 부동산 문제 해결이 그저 ‘정책’으로는 되지 않는다는 사실을 깨달아야 한다. 오늘날 한국 사회는 부동산으로 이득을 보는 걸 당연시하며, 그런 관점 아래 법제도와 사회구조 및 관습 등이 구성돼 있다. 한마디로 이것은 ‘체제’의 문제인 것이다. 그리하여 한국은 ‘불로소득 유발형 부동산체제’가 굳게 자리잡고 말았다. 

당연히 한두 가지 정책 도입만으로 이런 체제는 꿈쩍도 하지 않는다. 분명한 철학과 확고한 원칙, 그리고 체계적이고 종합적인 정책 패키지가 결합된 토탈 솔루션이 필요하다. 이 책 『불로소득 환수형 부동산체제론』은 체제의 관점에서 부동산 문제에 접근한 최초의 시도로, 부동산체제의 코페르니쿠스적 전환을 제안하고 있다.

'중국 특색의 사회주의'가 신시대에 접어들면서 아름다운 생활을 갈망하는 인민들의 요구는 날고 강렬해졌고, 날로 광범해졌다. 동시에 발전 불균형과 불충분으로 나타난 문제들을 해결하지 못했기에 발전 품질과 효익이 높지 못했다. 민생영역에는 아직도 많은 단점들이 있다. 사회문명은 향상되어야 하고 사회모순과 문제도 중첩되어 있다. 이 책은 시진핑 신시대 '중국 특색의 사회주의' 사상 연구를 담았다.

제1장 경제체제 개혁을 끝까지 진행하자
 1. 경제체제 개혁은 중국의 모습을 변화시켰다
  (1) 개혁은 중국경제 총량이 부단히 새로운 단계에 오르도록 했다
  (2) 개혁은 인민들의 생활을 최저생활 수준에서 전면적인 샤오캉사회로 발전시켰다
  (3) 개혁은 중국의 국제경쟁력을 현저하게 향상시켰다
  (4) 중요 영역과 관건적인 부분에서의 개혁은 돌파적인 진척을 가져왔다
 2. 개혁은 이미 관건적인 단계에 진입했다
  (1) 중국의 경제성장은 여전히 체제적 요소의 영향을 크게 받고 있다
  (2) 점진적 개혁에서 전면적 개혁의 심화로
  (3) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 일부 사람들의 이익을 건드릴 수 있다
 3. 반드시 실속 있게 개혁을 추진해야 한다
  (1) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 혁명과도 같은 것이기에 반드시 실속 있게 진행해야 한다
  (2) 개혁을 돌파할 수 있는 관건은 실시하는 데에 있다
  (3) 개혁을 하려는 자를 등용하고, 개혁을 하려하지 않는 자를 해임하는 인재등용의 방식을 지향해야 한다
 4. 오직 개혁개방 만이 중국을 발전시키고, 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다
  (1) 개혁개방은 백년 목표의 실현을 결정하는 관건이다
  (2) 경제체제 개혁은 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 중점이다
  (3) 발전을 포용하고 지속시키려면 개혁을 심화시키는 것에 의존해야 한다
  (4) 오직 개혁개방만이 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다

제2장 경제체제 개혁의 총체적 요구와 기본방향
 1. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키기 위한 총체적 요구
 2. 사회주의 공평 정의와 인민복지의 증진은 개혁의 출발점이고 목표점이다
 3. 사회주의 기본 경제제도를 견지하고 개선해야 한다
 4. 사회주의 시장경제의 개혁방향을 견지해야 한다
 5. 체제개혁의 목적과 조건
 6. 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 노선도

제3장 정확하게 전면적으로 경제체제의 개혁을 심화시키기 위해서는 약간의 중대한 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 1. 사상해방과 실사구시의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 2. 신중하게 일을 처리하는 것과 상부 설계와의 관계를 잘 처리 해야 한다
 3. 증량을 추진하는 국부적인 개혁과 전면적으로 추진하는 전반적인 개혁과의 관계를 잘 처리해야 한다
 4. 개혁ㆍ발전ㆍ안...

중국인민대학 과학연구처, 중국인민대학 국가발전과 전략연구원, 중국인민대학 “시진핑 신시대 ‘중국 특색의 사회주의’ 사상” 학습연구원 등이 공동으로 기획한 기구에서 중국인민대학 각 전공 별 영역의 전문가들을 모아 편찬했으며, 테마연구를 위해서는 국내 유관 연구기구의 연구원들을 모집했다. 

“시진핑 신시대 ‘중국 특색의 사회주의’ 사상”은 심오하고 내용도 풍부하므로 국내 학술계에서는 이 사상을 깊이 있게 연구해야 한다는 생각으로 이 사상을 연구하였다. 이렇게 하여 얻어낸 성과인 이 총서는 중국인민대학의 초보적인 결과물이라고 할 수 있다. 장차 중국인민대학은 중국인민대학 자체가 가지고 있는 전통적인 장점과 학과별 장점, 훌륭한 인재에 의지하여 이 사상을 더욱 깊이 있게 연구하여 더욱 우수한 연구 성과를 낼 수 있도록 당대 중국의 마르크스주의와 21세기 마르크스주의를 논술할 것을 기대해 마지않는다.

세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사까지 한 번에 명화로 쉽고 재미있고 빠르게 이해하는 경제 교양서. 역사를 잘 몰라도, 미술에 조예가 깊지 않아도, 경제 까막눈이어도 누구나 부담 없이 즐길 수 있는 명화 속 경쾌한 ‘경제’ 이야기. 재미있는 회계 강의로 유명한 현직 회계사인 저자답게 편안하고 재치있는 입담으로, 어렵게 느껴지던 세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사의 주요 흐름을 쉽고 재미있게 들려준다. 

중세 이탈리아에서부터 현대 미국까지 가난과 역병, 전쟁, 혁명의 위기와 불안을 극복해온 각 나라의 경험은 물론, 화가들의 반전 있는 마케팅 전략같이 생각지 못한 미술과 관련된 경제 이야기가 경쾌하게 펼쳐진다. 또 수없이 많은 위기를 되풀이해온 역사 속 인간의 다양한 경제 활동과 명화에 담긴 사람들의 욕망과 지혜에서 불안의 시대를 살아나갈 용기와 희망을 찾아볼 수 있다.

『C++로 나만의 운영체제 만들기』의 후속편으로, 저자가 직접 제작한 YUZA OS라는 OS를 파헤쳐 보면서 운영체제의 구조와 원리를 설명한다. 리눅스 같은 기존의 운영체제 개발환경에서 벗어나 윈도우 운영체제에서 OS를 개발하며 비주얼 스튜디오 2019와 C++로 운영체제 개발 방법을 설명하는 것이 특징이다. 아울러 저자가 게임 개발자 출신답게 다양한 게임을 자신만의 OS에서 쉽게 제작할 수 있는 방법을 설명하는 것에 심혈을 기울였다.

미국의 노동 운동가이자 작가인 리오 휴버먼은 “역사책에는 이런저런 왕들의 야망과 정복 그리고 전쟁에 관한 이야기가 장황하게 이어지는데, 왕들의 이야기보다는 왕권 배후에 있는 진정한 힘, 곧 그 시대의 상인과 금융업자의 이야기에 지면을 할애하는 편이 훨씬 나았을 것이다”라고 말했다.

세계 역사를 이끌어온 힘은, 왕이 아닌 상인과 금융업자에게서 나왔다는 얘기다. 실제로 세계를 뒤흔든 전환점이라 일컫는 포르투갈의 대항해, 네덜란드 중상주의 발흥, 영국의 산업혁명과 자본주의의 전개, 신대륙의 부흥, 미국의 눈부신 성장 등은 상인과 금융업자의 역사이자, 특히 유대인에 의해 시작되고 완성된 역사라는 사실을 부정할 사람은 없을 것이다. 

『유대인 이야기』의 저자인 경제학자 홍익희는 자본주의를 탄생시키고 세계 경제를 이끌어온 유대인의 역사, 그 가운데서도 오늘날의 금융혁명을 일으키고 세계 산업을 재편한 로스차일드 가문에 주목하였다.

1장 자본주의는 어떻게 탄생되었나?
1. 자본주의를 잉태한 청어 이야기 11
2. 17세기 네덜란드는 어떻게 2~3%대 저금리가 가능했을까? 31
3. 주식회사 민간 중앙은행의 탄생 비화 43

2장 영원한 금융 황제, 로스차일드
1. 로스차일드 가문의 탄생 69
2. 고화폐 상인에서 황실 대리인이 된 마이어 78
3. 로스차일드 시대의 서곡, 프랑스 대혁명과 나폴레옹의 등장 92
4. 영국으로 세력을 확장한 로스차일드 가문 105
5. 단기간에 유럽 금융계를 장악한 나탄 114
6. 마이어의 유언과 그가 남긴 다섯 화살 129
7. 로스차일드, 영국을 사다 137
8. 로스차일드, 세계 금본위제에 시동을 걸다 152
9. 산업혁명 전파의 원동력, 로스차일드의 자본 163
10. 나탄 잠들고 야콥의 시대로 174
11. 로스차일드 3대의 활약 182
12. 로스차일드 후손들 191

3장 커튼 뒤의 로스차일드
1. 로스차일드, 모건 시대를 열다 203
2. 미국 연방준비은행의 탄생 228
3. 미국 산업을 양분한 두 재벌, 모건과 록펠러 243
4. 로스차일드, 이스라엘 건국을 돕다 252

경제대항해 시대, 한국호를 둘러싼 조류와 파도, 바람, 비의 방향과 세기를 점검하고 향후 한국호의 최적 운항 전략과 방법론을 모색하고자 쓰였다. 최적의 솔루션은 외부 위기 요인과 내부 역량에 대한 엄격한 점검에서 나올 수밖에 없다. 따라서 저자는 ‘도전의 실체’와 ‘응전의 능력’을 함께 평가하는 지난한 작업을 벌이고 있다.

저자는 지난 10여 년간 언론에 게재한 칼럼들을 주제별로 나눠 이 책에 수록하였다. 칼럼을 취사선택하지 않고 있는 그대로 모두 실었다. 칼럼의 제목(큰 제목, 부제)과 내용 또한 언론에 나간 그대로이다. 단 한 자의 가필도 수정도 없었다. 동일한 주제에 대해 현재에서 과거로 거슬러 올라가는 시간의 여정을 밟고 있다. 과거의 칼럼이 현재 칼럼의 배경이자 역사가 되어 페이지를 더할수록 스스로 설명이 되는 구조를 택했다.

칼럼 뒤에는 국제분야 주요 시사용어에 대한 친절하고도 자세한 설명과 함께 현재 시점에서 필자가 칼럼에 대해 느끼는 소회와 관련 경제 지식들을 제시하였다. 특히 ‘지식 한 토막’에서는 유발 하라리와 베르베르, 폴 크루그만, 바그와티, 그레이엄 앨리슨, 마이클 스펜스 등 세계적인 작가와 학자들의 흥미진진한 분석과 이론들이 총망라되어 소개되고 있다.

2020년 벤처 투자 시장은 펀딩 6조 원 시대를 여는 새로운 역사를 썼다. 코로나19는 팬데믹이라는 유례없는 위기를 몰고 왔지만 동시에 많은 기업에게 기회의 장도 제공한 것이다. 많은 일반 투자자들의 관심이 특히 바이오 종목으로 집중되었지만 사실 수년째 바이오는 벤처 캐피털 업계(VC)에서 가장 핫한 투자 섹터로 자리 잡고 있었다. 

그중에서도 황만순 한투파 대표는 남다른 존재감을 발휘해왔다. 2020년만 해도 3,500억 원대의 바이오 섹터 펀드를 결성했고 지놈앤컴퍼니, 젠큐릭스, 엔젠바이오 등의 기업을 상장시키는 등 지금까지 바이오 헬스케어 분야에만 190여 개 기업에 7,500억 원 이상을 투자해왔다.

『대한민국 바이오 투자』는 바이오 섹터에 생소한 일반 개인 투자자의 질문에 대한 답변 형식으로 구성되었으며 바이오 섹터 투자에 있어 꼭 알아야 할 기초적인 관련 지식과 절대 실패하지 않는 투자 방식, 그리고 지녀야 할 마음가짐까지 친절하게 설명한다. 저자는 지난 20년 벤처 캐피털리스트로서 쌓은 경험을 나누고 싶어 이 책을 쓰게 되었으며 독자분들께 조금의 도움이라도 되길 원한다고 담담하게 이야기한다.

세상을 움직이는 33가지 핵심 경제이론을 깔끔하게 정리한 경제 입문서다. 리처드 세일러의 ‘넛지 이론’, 대니얼 카너먼의 ‘전망 이론’, 쉬나 아이엔가의 ‘상품 선택의 법칙’ 등 행동경제학과 게임이론에서부터 현대 화폐 이론(MMT)과 피케티의 21세기 자본론까지 꼭 알아야 할 최신 경제이론을 한 권에 담았다. 

또한 애덤 스미스의 ‘보이지 않는 손’, 리카도의 비교우위론, 케인스의 유효수요론, 슘페터의 경기순환론 등 역사적으로 중요한 경제이론들이 어떻게 발전해오며 세계를 변화시켰는지 살펴본다. 경제이론과 실물 경제가 어떤 지점에서 어긋나는지, 경제이론의 한계도 지적한다. 이 책은 세상을 움직이는 경제의 원리를 쉽지만 제대로 이해하고 싶은 사람들에게 유용한 가이드가 될 것이다.

지금은 버블인가, 아닌가? 현재 상황을 두고 개인 투자자들은 물론 전문가들도 의견이 팽팽하게 맞선다. 급변하는 현재를 어떻게 해석하고 행동을 취해야 하는가? 거대한 전환점에 서 있는 우리는 이익을 얻는 사람이 될 것인가, 잃는 사람이 될 것인가? 이 책은 인류 최초의 버블부터 현재까지 300년 역사를 뒤흔든 버블의 사태를 살펴본다. 왜, 무엇이, 버블을 만들었으며 누가 그것을 이용해 부를 잃고 누군가는 이익을 얻었는지 반복되는 호황과 불황의 주기를 바탕으로 통찰력을 제공한다.

저자들은 ‘시장성·자본·투기’가 만드는 거품 경제를 ‘버블 트라이앵글’이라고 분석하며 새로운 프레임워크를 제시한다. 역사상 버블의 사태는 이 3가지 요건의 비이성적 패턴을 가졌다는 것이다. 사회적 변화와 이슈가 있을 때마다 전 세계 경제는 대전환기를 맞아왔다. 코로나 19가 지핀 전 세계 경제 변화는 씨앗의 형태가 다를 뿐, 역사상 최초의 현상이 아니다. '파이낸셜타임스'가 선정한 올해의 책이자, 급변하는 경제 상황을 분석하고 새로운 프레임워크를 제시하는 <버블 : 부의 대전환>을 통해 거인의 어깨, 놀라운 통찰에서 그 답을 구해보자.

차세대 산업혁명인 4차 산업혁명은 지금껏 상상만 해 왔던 기술들을 점차 현실화시키고 있다. 많은 이들이 우려하는 대로 이러한 기술의 진보가 인간의 일자리를 빼앗는 일이 이미 벌어지고 있다. 얼마 전까지만 해도 사람이 제공하던 서비스들을 이제 AI(인공지능)나 로봇 등의 기계가 대신 하는 일이 급속히 늘고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 본격적으로 진행될수록 이런 현상은 더욱 가속화할 것이다.

저자는 일과 일자리 관점에서 볼 때 4차 산업혁명은 인간의 사고를 뿌리까지 바꾸게 함으로써 이전과는 완전히 다른 세상을 도래하게 만드는 ‘변곡점’이 될 것이라 확신하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명을 통해 발전할 기술들로 인해 기존의 일자리 대다수가 사라질 가능성이 농후하기 때문이다. 

많은 이들이 4차 산업혁명의 기술적 성취에 취해 장밋빛 미래를 그리고 있는 지금, 저자는 다음과 같은 질문을 던진다. 4차 산업혁명이 성공적으로 마무리되고 나면 우리는 기술 진보의 혜택을 마음껏 향유할 수 있을까? 현재와 같은 우리 일자리는 남아 있을까? 그때에도 우리는 먹고살기 위해 일해야 할까? 모든 면에서 인류를 능가하는 AI가 등장해도 우리는 지금처럼 생태계 최정상의 지위를 유지할 수 있을까?

이 책은 인류 문명 탄생부터 AI와 로봇까지, 일과 일자리 변천사를 일목요연하게 정리하고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 앞선 산업혁명들과 본질적으로 어떤 차이가 있으며 어느 정도의 파급력을 가질지에 대해 통찰력 있는 전망을 내놓고 있다. 그리고 기술 진보가 예고된 미래 세상을 디스토피아가 아닌 유토피아로 만들기 위해 지금 인류가 어떤 준비를 해야 하는지에 대해서도 구체적인 방안을 제시한다.

[라이노 파이썬]은 라이노 환경과 사용법에 어느 정도 익숙한 독자를 대상으로 하고 있으며, 파이썬 언어를 활용한 라이노 프로그램의 조형 연구 및 제어를 다루고 있다. 이 책의 근본적인 목적은 특정 언어 및 프로그램의 사용법을 익히게 하는 것이 아니라, 건축 디지털 디자인과 관련된 프로그래밍에 대한 기본적인 이해를 돕고 3D 프로그램과의 연동 및 그 가능성을 탐구하도록 하는 것이다. 

건축 디자이너로서 프로그래밍을 어떻게 받아들여야 하는지, 프로그래밍은 무엇을 할 수 있는지, 스크립트를 쓸 때는 어떻게 생각해 나가야 하는지, 기본적인 바탕으로 숙지해야 되는 내용은 무엇인지 등 디지털 디자인에 대한 생각을 정리하고, 직접 뛰어들어 써 나갈 수 있도록 방향을 제시할 수 있는 조력자의 역할을 수행하고자 한다.

파이썬은 초보자부터 전문가까지 사용자층을 보유하고 있는데 그 이유는 누구나 쉽게 접근하여 대부분의 응용 소프트웨어에서 사용 가능하기 때문이다. 동적 타이핑(Dynamic typing) 범용 프로그래밍 언어로, 펄 및 루비가 있는데 파이썬과 자주 비교되지만 다양한 플랫폼에서 쓸 수 있고, 라이브러리(모듈)가 풍부하여, 대학 및 다양한 교육기관, 연구 기관 및 산업계에서 이용이 증가하고 있다. 

이 책은 파이썬에 대한 전문지식과 IT 서비스 및 인프라 구축에 필요한 모든 정보를 담았다. 순개념 익히기부터 문제 학습, 능력 넓히기, 실전문제 도전, 마스터 능력 갖추기까지 핵심을 찌르는 개념 익히기와 실전문제로 파이썬을 빠르게 학습한다. 또한 단계별 구성으로 더 체계적인 스스로 학습이 가능하다.

데이터 분석을 다룬 많은 책 중 나에게 맞는 책을 찾는 건 매우 어렵다. 이론 위주의 책을 선택하면 이해하기 어렵고, 응용 위주의 책을 선택하면 기본 개념이 부족하다. 이 책은 이론을 쉽게 설명하고 예제로 응용해 보도록 구성하여 자연스럽게 데이터 분석 과정을 익힐 수 있다.

파이썬 데이터 분석에 필수로 사용되는 라이브러리를 단계적으로 다루어 데이터를 전처리하고 분석하는 능력을 갖춘다. 이 과정에서 넘파이, 판다스, 맷플롯립은 물론 연관 라이브러리까지 상세히 소개한다. 그리고 소개한 라이브러리를 종합하여 활용할 수 있는 세 가지 실전 예제를 담았다.

이 책은 단순히 머신러닝의 알고리즘 사용법을 알려주는 것이 아니라 파이썬을 이용해 알고리즘을 처음부터 구현해봄으로써 알고리즘의 동작 원리를 이해하는 것을 목표로 한다. 따라서 현업에서 프레임워크나 라이브러리를 사용하면서 잊기 쉬운 머신러닝의 기초와 기반 구조를 이해할 수 있다. 또한 머신러닝 알고리즘을 설명하기에 앞서 머신러닝에 필수적인 수학의 기본기를 탄탄히 쌓아가기 때문에 머신러닝에 대한 응용과 문제해결 능력을 키우는 데 힘을 실어준다.
