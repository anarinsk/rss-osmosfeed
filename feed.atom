        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alfred Marshall and Mary Paley Marshall are often described as the first academic economist couple. Both studied at Cambridge University, where Paley became one of the first women to take the Tripos exam and the first female lecturer in economics, with Marshall’s encouragement. But in later life, Marshall opposed granting Cambridge degrees to women and their participation in academic economics. This paper recounts Alfred Marshall’s use of gender norms, born out of a separate spheres ideology, to promote and ingrain women’s exclusion in academic economics and beyond. We demonstrate the persistence of this ideology and resultant norms, drawing parallels between gendered inequities in labor market outcomes for Cambridge graduates in the UK post-Industrial Revolution and those apparent in cross-country data today. We argue that the persistence of the norms produced by separate spheres ideologies is likely to reflect, at least in part, the rents associated with preferential access to better paid, high-skilled labor market opportunities. In doing so, we ask who benefits from gender norms, who enforces them, and suggest relevant policy work and areas for future research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States is one of the few countries that does not guarantee paid family leave (PFL) to workers. Proposals for PFL legislation are often met with opposition from employer organizations, who fear disruptions to business, especially among small employers. But there has been limited data on employers' views. We surveyed firms with 10-99 employees in New York and New Jersey on their attitudes towards PFL programs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found high support for state PFL programs in 2019 that rose substantially over the course of the pandemic: by the fall of 2020, almost 70% of firms were supportive. Increases in support were larger among firms that had an employee use PFL, suggesting that experience with PFL led to employers becoming more supportive. Thus, concerns about negative impacts on small employers should not impede efforts to expand PFL at the state or federal levels.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies optimal capital-control and bank-reserve remuneration policy in an open economy with a banking channel and a collateral constraint that limits household debt by a fraction of income. It finds that the unregulated economy borrows too little relative to what is optimal (underborrowing). This finding contrasts with the standard overborrowing result obtained in the absence of a banking channel. Under optimal policy, the central bank injects bank reserves during recessions. In this way, the monetary authority is able to uncouple household deleveraging from economy-wide deleveraging, thereby ameliorating the severity of the financial crisis. The paper documents that in emerging and developed economies the lending spread (lending rate minus deposit rate) displayed a muted response during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. This fact is consistent with a decline in the demand rather than in the supply of loans and gives credence to models in which the collateral constraint is placed at the level of the nonfinancial sector as opposed to at the level of the bank.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Provider payments are the key determinant of insurance generosity within many health insurance programs covering low-income populations. This paper analyzes the effects of a large, federally-mandated provider payment increase for primary care services provided to low-income elderly and disabled individuals.  Drawing upon comprehensive administrative payment and utilization data, we leverage variation across beneficiaries and across providers in the policy-induced payment increase in difference-in-differences and triple differences research designs. The estimates indicate that the provider payment reform led to a 6.3% increase in the targeted services provided to eligible beneficiaries, indicating an implied payment elasticity of 1.3.  Further, the provider payment reform decreased the fraction of low-income beneficiaries with no primary care visit in a year by 9%, completely closing the gap relative to higher-income beneficiaries with the same observable characteristics. Additionally, the results indicate that the payment reform caused an increase in established patient visits, with no increase in new patient visits. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the payment increase led to an expansion of utilization for many subgroups, with somewhat larger effects among beneficiaries who are younger, are white, and live in areas with many primary care providers per capita.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congress responded to the COVID pandemic’s disruptions to instruction with unprecedented federal aid for school districts. While this relief has been widely characterized as a major windfall for K-12 education, per-pupil amounts vary considerably across districts, as will the costs districts face for COVID mitigation and recovery. In this paper, we conduct simulations to understand the potential distribution of net effects of the pandemic and federal aid on the finances of local school districts in the next several years. In our baseline scenario, we assume one-time adjustment costs of $500 per pupil plus additional costs of $1,000 per student in poverty and $500 per student not in poverty per year for four years. Federal aid was distributed proportional to the longstanding Title I program, which sends more money per pupil to higher poverty districts. Low-poverty districts are therefore projected to face some budgetary shortfalls, while many higher poverty districts are projected to have excess funds, which they could direct towards long-standing challenges. While our findings depend on key assumptions about the COVID-related costs, we find significant district-level variation in simulated net fiscal impacts, in part but not completely due to poverty rates, across all the scenarios we consider.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demographic transition --the move from a high fertility/high mortality regime into a low fertility/low mortality regime-- is one of the most fundamental transformations that countries undertake. To study demographic transitions across time and space, we compile a data set of birth and death rates for 186 countries spanning more than 250 years. We document that (i) a demographic transition has been completed or is ongoing in nearly every country; (ii) the speed of transition has increased over time; and (iii) having more neighbors that have started the transition is associated with a higher probability of a country beginning its own transition. To account for these observations, we build a quantitative model in which parents choose child quantity and educational quality. Countries differ in geographic location, and improved production and medical technologies diffuse outward from Great Britain. Our framework replicates well the timing and increasing speed of transitions. It also produces a correlation between the speeds of fertility transition and increases in schooling similar to the one in the data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facing unprecedented uncertainty and drastic trade-offs between public health and other forms of human well-being, policy makers during the Covid-19 pandemic have sought the guidance of epidemiologists and economists. Unfortunately, while both groups of scientists use many of the same basic mathematical tools, the models they develop to inform policy tend to rely on different sets of assumptions and, thus, often lead to different policy conclusions. This divergence in policy recommendations can lead to uncertainty and confusion, opening the door to disinformation, distrust of institutions, and politicization of scientific facts. Unfortunately, to date, there have not been widespread efforts to build bridges and find consensus or even to clarify sources of differences across these fields, members of whom often continue to work within their traditional academic silos. In response to this “crisis of communication,” we convened a group of scholars from epidemiology, economics, and related fields (e.g., statistics, engineering, and health policy) to discuss approaches to modeling economy-wide pandemics. We summarize these conversations by providing a consensus view of disciplinary differences (including critiques) and working through a specific policy example. Thereafter, we chart a path forward for more effective synergy between disciplines, which we hope will lead to better policies as the current pandemic evolves and future pandemics emerge.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We examine how disadvantaged students make postsecondary education decisions, focusing on why they often opt for short, ﬂexible programs that tend to have low returns in the labor market. Prior literature emphasizes information deﬁcits and ﬁnancial constraints. We draw upon qualitative data collected via open-ended interviews conducted with a sample of economically disadvantaged Black youth in Baltimore. We use these data to develop and explore a complementary narrative: students who have faced instability or hardship in the form of disruptive events, or “adverse shocks” (e.g., violence, eviction or incarceration of a family member), anticipate future shocks that could derail their educational plans. In response, they opt for shorter, more ﬂexible educational programs that they expect they can complete despite anticipated shocks. When possible, we corroborate this narrative using publicly available, large-N data sets such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Finally, we formalize this narrative as a simple dynamic structural model calibrated using data on education choices and returns. The model clariﬁes that it is impossible to identify costs of schooling without data on beliefs about the probability of non-completion, thus providing guidance on future data collection priorities. More broadly, our approach demonstrates a novel application of mixed methods research: using qualitative data to aid in the speciﬁcation of a structural model. This approach could be applied in other contexts where behavior is poorly understood and extant data do not contain all of the information needed to generate and test plausible hypotheses.]]></summary>

We identify a complementarity between worldview politics and identity politics and illustrate how they may reinforce each other. Furthermore, we show how adverse economic shocks may result in a greater incidence of ideational politics. We use these results to analyze data on 60,000 televised political ads in U.S. localities over the years 2000 through 2018.

We calibrate the model to the same countries used to document our patterns. We find that sector-biased productivity growth is important for deindustrialization, and sectoral trade integration is important for industry polarization through specialization. The interaction of these two driving forces is also essential. The key transmission channel is the declining relative price of manufacturing goods to services over time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper evaluates the impact of slowing economic growth on labor market dynamism and misallocation. It provides a model of endogenous growth via imitation in a frictional labor market. The framework accounts for rich data on worker job-to-job transitions as well as stochastic and lifecycle properties of firm growth and job reallocation. High productivity entrants gradually replace obsolescing incumbents by poaching their workers, a process that is intermediated via a frictional labor market. When the likelihood of entrants imitating technologies in the tail of the distribution falls (ideas are harder to find), so does growth. Consistent with US data over the past 30 years, firm entry, incumbents’ employment response to productivity shocks, and job-to-job transitions decline, while the share of old firms increases. With lower imitation, however, there is less misallocation, because the slower aggregate rate of obsolescence induces productive firms to invest more in costly hiring and grow faster to their optimal size.]]></summary>

First, air and water pollution have declined substantially, although greenhouse gas emissions have not. Second, environmental policy explains a large share of these trends. Third, much of the regulation of air and drinking water pollution has benefits that exceed costs, although the evidence for surface water pollution regulation is less clear. Fourth, while the distribution of pollution across social groups is unequal, market-based environmental policies and command-and-control policies do not appear to produce systematically different distributions of environmental outcomes. I also discuss recent innovations in methods and data that can be used to evaluate pollution trends and policies, including the increased use of environmental administrative data, statistical cost-benefit comparisons, analysis of previously understudied policies, more sophisticated analyses of pollution transport, micro-macro frameworks, and a focus on the distribution of environmental outcomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Empirical tests in the 1990s found little evidence of poor countries catching up with rich - unconditional convergence - since the 1960s, and divergence over longer periods. This stylized fact spurred several developments in growth theory, including AK models, poverty trap models, and the concept of convergence conditional on determinants of steady-state income. We revisit these findings, using the subsequent 25 years as an out-of-sample test, and document a trend towards unconditional convergence since 1990 and convergence since 2000, driven by both faster catch-up growth and slower growth of the frontier. During the same period, many of the correlates of growth - human capital, policies, institutions, and culture - also converged substantially and moved in the direction associated with higher income. Were these changes related? Using the omitted variable bias formula, we decompose the gap between unconditional and conditional convergence as the product of two cross-sectional slopes. First, correlate-income slopes, which remained largely stable since 1990. Second, growth-correlate slopes controlling for income - the coefficients of growth regressions - which remained stable for fundamentals of the Solow model (investment rate, population growth, and human capital) but which flattened substantially for other correlates, leading unconditional convergence to converge towards conditional convergence.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
Housing economist Tom Lawler discusses the “household conundrum” - why it is unclear how many households there are in the U.S..
...
One of the challenges facing housing analysts in trying to assess the current and future state of the US housing market is the lack of timely and reliable estimates of the number of and characteristics of US households.  This challenge has become even more acute since the onset of the pandemic, as significant declines in response rates to government surveys of households have adversely affected the accuracy of already imperfect household estimates. The lack of reliable household data makes it difficult to assess how much of the astonishing strength in the housing market since the middle of last year has been related to “demographics,” as opposed to behavioral and preference changes associated with the pandemic and, more recently, the surge in investor purchases of single-family homes.
...
While HVS household estimates have always been volatile (partly related to the small sample size of the CPS), and have not matched decennial Census results, the estimates produced since the onset of the pandemic have been … well … ridiculous.  Below is a table of the HVS estimates of total and owner-occupied households.
As the table indicates, the number of households estimated from the HVS exploded upward following the onset of the pandemic, and the number of owner-occupied households rose by an astonishing and completely unbelievable amount.  And following that surge the HVS estimates of total households fell, and the number of owner-occupied households plummeted!

        <updated>2021-11-19T21:00:00.001Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.34 million in October, up 0.8% from September’s preliminary pace and down 5.8% from last October’s seasonally adjusted   pace. Unadjusted sales should show a larger YOY decline, reflecting this October’s lower business day count relative to last October’s.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that the YOY decline in the inventory of existing homes for sale was slightly larger than was the case in September.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 12.9% from last October.
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release October existing home sales on Monday, November 22, 2021 at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 6.20 million SAAR.   Take the over.

Note that the NAR reported median prices were up 23.6% Year-over-year (YoY) in May, 23.4% in June, 17.8% in July, 14.9% in August and 13.3% in September. And it appears the YoY growth slowed a little more in October.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
This is the fifth look at local markets in October. This update adds Alabama, Austin, Boston, Charlotte, Indiana, Minneapolis, Phoenix, and Rhode Island.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported so far in October. For these markets, inventory was down 6.5% in October MoM from September, and down 24.1% YoY.
Of the markets that have reported so far, inventories in Jacksonville and San Diego are at record lows. Sacramento and Washington, D.C. are the only markets so far with inventory up YoY in October (Austin is essentially unchanged YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 22.1% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is slightly larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market.
In California, the C.A.R. reported inventory was down 18.3% YoY, but this isn’t included in the table below since C.A.R. doesn’t report monthly numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This data is as of November 16th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Mid-November Forbearance Exits Low and Slow
In what has become a familiar pattern, the number of active forbearance plans held relatively steady entering the third week of November.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans increased by 2,000 (0.2%) this week. Modest declines among FHA/VA loans (-2,000) and GSE (-1,000) were offset by a 5,000 rise in plan volumes among portfolio and PLS mortgages as plan activity hit its lowest level since mid-August. Start volumes edged higher, driven by an increase in new plans among FHA/VA loans, which hit their highest level since early October.
As of November 16, 1.01 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 1.9% of all active mortgages, including 1.2% of GSE, 3.1% of FHA/VA and 2.4% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.
  Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Overall, the number of forbearance plans is still down by 230,000 (-18%) from the same time last month, with the potential for additional improvements as we enter December. More than 200,000 plans remain with October/November reviews for extension/removal and nearly 300,000 more are slated for review in December – half of which are expected to be reaching their final expirations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Also, incoming port traffic is backed up significantly in the LA area with numerous ships at anchor waiting to unload.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation's container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12 month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12 month basis, inbound traffic was down 0.5% in October compared to the rolling 12 months ending in September.   Outbound traffic was down 1.4% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports - and with the backlog of ships, will probably continue strong into 2022 (no break again in February or March).
Imports were down 6% YoY in October (recovered last year following the early months of the pandemic), and exports were down 15% YoY.]]></summary>

Redfin identified an “investor” as follows:
We define an investor as any buyer whose name includes at least one of the following keywords: LLC, Inc, Trust, Corp, Homes. We also define an investor as any buyer whose ownership code on a purchasing deed includes at least one of the following keywords: association, corporate trustee, company, joint venture, corporate trust.

Excerpt: 
Currently my view is house prices seem too high, but lending has been reasonably solid, and there are some fundamental reasons for the high house prices (See: The Housing Conundrum)
If inventory stays low, then house prices will continue to rise fairly quickly (although it appears house price growth is slowing).  Double digit house price increases aren’t sustainable, so the question I’m asking now is: What will cause inventories to increase?
I’m considering three possibilities: 1) mortgage rates rise fairly quickly, slowing demand, 2) economic problems in China spillover into the US, and 3) unregulated areas of finance cause economic problems.
...
This is something I mentioned on my blog in 2013:
Each new generation of Wall Street wizards figures out a new way to turn lead into gold, and to become wealthy while damaging the financial system.   Some of these wizards are probably perfecting their financial alchemy right now.
...
The most likely cause of higher home inventories will be higher mortgage rates, but unregulated areas of finance are always a concern and something I’ll be watching.

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Rate Maintains Growth Over 2019
U.S. hotel performance increased slightly from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through November 13.
November 7-13, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 61.6% (-3.9%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $129.98 (+2.6%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $80.02 (-1.4%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The occupancy rate will now decline seasonally into the new year.]]></summary>

지금까지 사람들은 직장과 가족 등에서 안정감을 얻고 유대를 획득해왔다. 그러나 이제 직업은 표준과 안정이 아닌 불안정의 상징이다. 삶은 유동성에 지배되고 있다. 이에 순응하듯 긱잡, 프리터, N잡러 같은 저고용 방식들이 확산되고 있다. 결혼과 가족 또한 안전판으로서의 제도가 아닌 예측 불가능한 사건이 되었다. 그렇다면 현대인들은 이런 전통적인 공동체 대신 무엇으로부터 정체성의 위기를 해소하고 안정감과 유대감을 찾고 있을까? 바로 취향이다. 회사 회식은 싫지만 취향 모임에는 기꺼이 참석하며, 가족과 함께 TV를 보는 대신 SNS와 게임 친구들과 소통한다. 

도서출판 따비의 신간 《취향의 경제―취향의 시대는 산업과 소비를 어떻게 바꾸는가》는 취향을 추구하는 개인들이 경제와 산업을 어떻게 바꾸어냈는지를 논증하며, 취향의 추구가 불평등과 혐오를 완화하는 방향으로 나아가려면 무엇이 필요한지 모색한다.

우리 시대가 직면한 긴박한 문제들―이민, 세계화, 자동화와 실업, 경제 성장과 불평등, 기후변화, 정부의 역할 등―을 해결하려면 경제학이 필요하다. 하지만 경제학은 지금까지는 너무나 경직적인 이상의 세계에서 이론적 모델과 같은 대안만 내놓았다. 저자들은 마치 저 높은 하늘에만 떠 있던 경제학을 우리가 살고 있는 땅, 즉 현실로 끌고 내려와 실증 근거들을 기반으로 우리 사회의 큰 문제들을 실제로 해결하기 위한 방법을 파고든다. 

노벨상 수상 경제학자 배너지와 뒤플로는 경제학이 제대로만 수행된다면 (그러니까 ‘좋은 경제학’이) 우리 시대의 가장 첨예한 사회적, 정치적 난제들을 해결하는 데 일조할 수 있다고 말한다. 이주 문제부터 불평등까지, 성장의 둔화부터 기후변화의 가속화까지, 우리는 거대한 어려움에 직면해 있다. 하지만 그 어려움을 헤쳐 나갈 수 있는 자원과 역량이 없는 것도 아니다.

이 책은 우리에게 이런 문제들을 해결할 새로운 관점을 독창적이고 도발적이며 시의적절하게 제시한다. 저자들의 깊은 통찰을 통해, 아슬아슬한 균형 위에 서 있는 우리 세계의 문제점과 역량 모두를 더 올바르게 이해할 수 있게 될 것이다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: This index is a leading indicator primarily for new Commercial Real Estate (CRE) investment.
From the AIA: Demand for design services moderates but remains strong
Architecture firms reported increasing demand for design services in October, according to a new report today from The American Institute of Architects (AIA).
The ABI score for October was 54.3. While this score is down slightly from September’s score of 56.6, it still indicates very strong business conditions overall (any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings from the prior month). During October, scoring for both the new project inquiries and design contracts expanded, posting scores of 62.9 and 58.0 respectively.
“Unlike the economy-wide payroll figures, architecture services employment has surpassed its pre-pandemic high,” said AIA Chief Economist, Kermit Baker, Hon. AIA, PhD. “Staffing continues to be a growing concern at architecture firms and may serve to limit their ability to take on new projects.”
...
• Regional averages: Midwest (61.9); South (58.2); West (53.4); Northeast (48.6)
• Sector index breakdown: mixed practice (58.7); commercial/industrial (57.4); multi-family residential (55.8); institutional (51.4)

This graph shows the Architecture Billings Index since 1996. The index was at 54.3 in October, down from 56.6 in September.  Anything above 50 indicates expansion in demand for architects' services.
Note: This includes commercial and industrial facilities like hotels and office buildings, multi-family residential, as well as schools, hospitals and other institutions.
This index was below 50 for eleven consecutive months, but has been solidly positive for the last nine months.  

The eleven months of decline represented a significant decrease in design services, and suggests a decline in CRE investment through most of 2021 (This index usually leads CRE investment by 9 to 12 months), however this suggests a pickup in CRE investment in 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Most Housing Units Under Construction Since 1974
Excerpt: 
The fourth graph shows starts under construction, Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
Red is single family units. Currently there are 726 thousand single family units under construction (SA). This is the highest level since 2007.
For single family, most of these homes are already sold (Census counts sales when contract is signed). The reason there are so many homes is probably due to construction delays. Since most of these are already sold, it is unlikely this is “overbuilding”, or that this will impact prices.
Blue is for 2+ units. Currently there are 725 thousand multi-family units under construction.  This is the highest level since 1974! For multi-family, construction delays are probably also a factor. The completion of these units should help with rent pressure.
Census will release data next year on the length of time from start to completion, and that will probably show long delays in 2021. In 2020, it took an average of 6.8 months from start to completion for single family homes, and 15.4 months for buildings with 2 or more units.
Combined, there are 1.451 million units under construction. This is the most since 1974.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the Census Bureau: Permits, Starts and Completions
Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,520,000.  This is 0.7 percent below the revised September estimate of 1,530,000, but is 0.4 percent above the October 2020 rate of 1,514,000.  Single‐family housing starts in October were at a rate of 1,039,000; this is 3.9 percent below the revised September figure of 1,081,000. The October rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 470,000. 
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,650,000.  This is 4.0 percent above the revised September rate of 1,586,000 and is 3.4 percent above the October 2020 rate of 1,595,000.  Single‐family authorizations in October were at a rate of 1,069,000; this is 2.7 percent above the revised September figure of 1,041,000.  Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 528,000 in October.

The first graph shows single and multi-family housing starts for the last several years.
Multi-family starts (blue, 2+ units) increased in October compared to September.   Multi-family starts were up 37% year-over-year in October.
Single-family starts (red) decreased in October, and were down 10.6% year-over-year.
The second graph shows single and multi-family housing starts since 1968. 
This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and then the eventual recovery (but still not historically high).
Total housing starts in October were below expectations, and starts in August and September were revised down, combined.

This column presents new historical evidence that revises earlier results and reveals long-term patterns. A key finding is that wealth has changed in nature over the past century: once held by the elite, it is now widely held in the form of housing and pension savings. These changes appear to account for the redistribution of wealth over the last century and the fact that its concentration has remained relatively low in more recent decades despite rapid increases in aggregate wealth.]]></summary>

초등 사회 교과에 등장하는 경제 개념 24개를 한 컷의 그림으로 표현해 어른은 물론 아이도 이해하기 쉽게 표현한다. 그리고 그 24개의 개념을 확장하여 부모와 아이가 함께 돈에 대해 생각하고 이야기 나눠본 뒤 실천할 수 있는 재테크 활동 팁을 ‘돈 레시피’ 형태로 제공한다.

저자는 이 책을 통해 어른과 아이 스스로 “살면서 얼마만큼의 돈이 있으면 부자인가?”에 대한 기준을 세우라고 강조한다. 그 기준이 있어야 그에 필요한 재테크 활동과 투자 금액을 설정할 수 있고, 스스로의 기준이 있으면 타인과의 비교로 불행해하거나 돈 자체를 숭배하지 않을 수 있기 때문이다.

‘오늘날 화폐 시스템은 어떻게 만들어졌을까? 달러 중심의 화폐 시스템은 언제까지 유효할까? 달러를 대체할 화폐는 무엇일까? 과연 국가권력으로부터 독립된 화폐 시스템을 만들 수 있을까? 비트코인과 디지털 화폐의 미래는?’

이런 질문에 분명한 답을 제시하는 책이 출간돼 화제다. 출간되자마자 입소문을 타며 아마존 베스트셀러가 되었고 세계 각국에서 출간되고 있는 는 화폐의 역사를 ‘계층 화폐(Layered Money)’라는 획기적이고 독창적인 틀로 살펴봄으로써 대중이 화폐 시스템을 쉽게 이해하고, 개념을 재정립하도록 도와주는 책이다. 

는 인류가 주화를 처음 쓰던 때부터 금・은, 달러를 거쳐 현재 비트코인에 이르기까지 화폐 시스템이 어떻게 만들어지고 변화해 현재에 이르렀는지 ‘계층 구조’라는 렌즈를 통해 일목요연하게 보여준다. 

책은 또한 비트코인이 등장할 수밖에 없었던 필연성과 비트코인의 개념, 구조, 역할 등도 설명하고 있다. 이 여정을 따라가다 보면 우리가 쓰는 화폐와 시스템이 어떤 필요에 의해 창조되고 운영되며 또 어떤 구조적 문제를 안고 있는지 한눈에 파악할 수 있다.

노동소득만으로는 더 이상 부를 누릴 수 없는 세상이다. 자본소득이 부에 더 가까이 데려다준다는 데 이견을 내는 사람은 없을 정도로 재테크는 기본적 소양이 되었다. 하지만 금융시장의 나눌 몫은 정해져 있다. 소수가 먼저 가져가면 나머지의 삶은 팍팍해지는 이치인 것이다. 투자하지 않으면 이주당하는 시대에서 우리는 자꾸만 돈을 버는 방법에 시야를 가둔다. 과연 금융시장은 투명하고 우리는 노력만으로 돈을 벌 수 있을까? 

이 책의 저자는 15년 동안 국내 최고의 애널리스트로 일하며 금융시장에서 큰 부를 거머쥔 사람과 순식간에 돈을 잃은 사람을 만나왔다. 그리고 한 가지 사실을 깨달았다. 돈을 버는 일은 예측할 수 없지만, 돈을 절대 잃지 않는 방법은 존재한다는 것이다. 이 책은 역사적으로 다양하게 나타난 금융 사기 사건을 파헤침과 동시에 그 안에 숨겨진 돈을 잃지 않는 절대 공식을 소개함으로써 우리의 자산을 안전하게 지킬 수 있는 방법에 대해 안내한다.

코로나 팬데믹이 던지는 메시지는 간단하다. 이와 같은 “극한 상황”이 언제 어디서든 벌어질 수 있으며, 우리의 경제와 삶은 생각보다 쉽게 무너질 수 있다는 것이다. 저자에 따르면 향후 10년 가장 중요한 추세는 “고령화, 디지털화, 불평등화” 3가지다. 현재도 우려를 자아내는 이 추세는 앞으로 더욱 심화하면서 분열과 갈등을 증폭하고 경제만이 아니라 정치, 사회 전반에서 대격변을 불러올 것이다.

극한에 대비하려면 극한에서 배우는 것이 가장 좋다. 이 전략에 따라 저자는 4대륙 9개국 16만 킬로미터를 가로지르는 “극한 경제 여행”을 떠난다. 이 책에서 만나는 여행지는 최선의 성공을 거둔 3곳(아체, 자타리, 루이지애나), 최악의 실패를 겪은 3곳(다리엔, 킨샤사, 글래스고), 최첨단의 미래를 달리는 3곳(아키타, 탈린, 산티아고)이다. 거의 또는 전혀 알려지지 않은 곳들이지만 극한 여행지로는 최고의 핫 스폿들이다. 

최악의 상황에 직면한 곳들이 살아남아 회복하고 성장하는 비결은 무엇인가? 반대로 최고의 조건을 갖춘 곳들이 참담한 실패와 몰락을 겪는 이유는 무엇인가? 임박한 미래를 선도하는 곳들은 어떤 충격과 도전에 직면하며 어떻게 대응하는가? 생생하고 감동적인 일상의 풍경과 현장의 목소리, 풍성하고 날카로운 연구 데이터와 역사를…]]></summary>

휴렛팩거드의 HP연구소 산하 경제실험실 머니랩에서 한 사람과 돈이 움직이는 방식을 다룬 실험경제학의 모든 연구 결과를 총망라하고 있다. 머니랩이란 ‘돈Money과 실험실Laboratory’을 합쳐 만든 용어이다. 휴렛팩커드에서 기업 최초로 머니랩을 설치하고 실험경제학을 통해 ‘돈이 움직이는 방식’을 연구했는데 그 결과를 총망라해 소개하고 있다.

실험경제학은 최근 주목받는 행동경제학 분야 중에서도 최첨단 영역으로 사람들이 의사결정을 하는 심리, 그 과정, 그리고 돈을 둘러싼 거래와 계약, 협상 등의 상황에서 실제로 어떻게 움직이는지 파악하기 위해 현실과 거의 유사한 실험 환경하에서 데이터를 도출하는 학문이다. 구글, 야후, 이베이 등 전자상거래의 규칙이나 운용 시스템을 만들어야 하는 기업뿐 아니라 피앤지, 존슨앤드존슨, 히타치 등 유수의 기업들이 촉각을 곤두세우며 관심을 보이는 책 속 실험경제학의 연구 결과들은 독자들에게 흥미롭게 다가온다.

HP연구소의 머니랩에서 한 경제 실험 결과를 통해 인간을 이해하게 된다면 인간을 예측할 수 있게 되고 그럼 게임의 법칙을 설계할 수 있게 된다. 즉 삶에서도 비즈니스에서도 게임의 법칙을 설계할 수 있게 되는 것이다. 이 책은 바로 그 사람들의 심리, 행동, 철학 그 …]]></summary>

대한민국은 그동안 크게 성장했다. 하지만 성장의 후유증 또한 크다. 국가 성공을 위해 희생했던 개인의 때늦은 보상의 욕구가 분출하고 있다. 자유민주주의에서 자유의 시장경쟁 원칙이 무너지고 민주의 법치주의가 위협받고 있다. 

외교와 안보에서도 극심한 분열과 혼란을 보이고 있다. 여기에 경제는 계속해서 추락하고 사람들의 좌절과 분노 그리고 갈등은 좀처럼 진정될 기미가 보이지 않고 있다. 국민적 에너지인 역동성마저 저하되고 있다.

방향은 목표이고 길은 그곳에 이르는 과정이다. 2022년 대선을 향한 경쟁의 총성이 울린 현재, 심학봉 전 의원은 국가가 당면한 이러한 문제들의 올바른 방향성을 재설정하고, 국가가 나아갈 새로운 길을 제안한다.

제3부 천천히 오래도록 함께 가자
1. 지속가능한 사회, 아름다운 미래의 길 / 2. 다시 만드는 대한민국 ‘우리’공동체 / 3. 대한민국 경제의 중심, 중산층을 살려라 / 4. 강한 국가는 무엇을 가지고 있을까? / 5. 뿌리 깊은 국가정신을 만들자 / 6. 정치적 편향! 이제는 정말 끝내야 해! 

제4부 원 팀이 되면 못 할 것이 없다
1. 모든 국민이 깨어 있는 그날까지 / 2. 국민과 국가가 함께 걷는 평화의 길 / 3. 국민의 행동력이 나라를 움직인다

이와나미 시리즈. 노벨 경제학상 후보로 거론되기로 했던 세계적인 경제학자 모리시마 미치오. 2004년 사망했지만, 이미 국내에서도 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》 등으로 유명한 그는 LSE 교수로 역임하면서 세계적으로 이름을 날리기 시작했다. 그는 친 자본주의와 자유주의 성향인  노벨 경제학상 선정 위원회의 경향에 맞지 않아 경제학상 수상에는 실패했으나, 일본 경제 위기를 진단하는 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》로 우리에게도 많은 교훈을 준다. 

이 책은 모리시마 미치오가 NHK에서 강의한 내용을 바탕으로 마르크스, 미제스, 케인스를 추가하여 11명의 유명 경제학자들의 사상에 관해 설명하고 있다. 방송을 기본으로 했기 때문에 어려운 근대경제학 역사를 좀 더 쉽고 정확하게 이해하는 데 도움이 된다.

근대경제학이 마주한 당시 시대 상황은 두 차례 세계대전과 대공황으로 점철된 격변의 시기였다. 그렇기에 당연히 새로운 경제 체제가 모색되었고, 많은 경제학자들이 경제학과 사회학의 종합화를 제창하였다. 저자 역시 이러한 경제학의 과제가 21세기까지도 유효하다고 보고 이 책을 집필하였다. 

책에 서술한 경제학자들이 자기 분야의 협소한 경제이론을 파고들기만 한 학자가 아닌 인간과 사회의 큰 틀에서 경제를 바라본 학자들 위주로 선정한 것도 그러한 까닭이다. 이것이 이 책의 가장 큰 장점이라 하겠다.

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.

개발자에게 바치는 머신러닝 가이드북이다. 철저하게 개발자의 시선에서 접근하고 실제 산업계에서 자주 사용되는 모델에 관해 설명한다. 동시에 신경망의 원리와 기초 구현 방법, 케라스 라이브러리의 사용법과 텐서플로를 활용한 모델 배포 방안도 포함한다. 복잡한 머신러닝 이론 대신, 간단한 AI 구현 코드를 보여주면서 구조와 프로세스를 설명한다. 그리고 초보 학습자가 궁금해할 문제를 선별하여 이러한 문제와 연계해 새로운 내용을 소개한다. 이 책의 모든 장에서 비슷한 방법을 사용하고 있다.

모든 국민에게 조건 없이 일정한 금액의 돈을 정기적으로 지급하는 기본소득. 모두에게 속한 ‘공유부’를 분배하자는 것이다 보니 돈이 많은 부자에게도 지급한다. 게다가 일을 하지 않아도 주는 무조건성의 원칙 때문에 자칫 사람들의 노동의욕을 꺾는 것은 아닐지, 기본소득 도입으로 선별 복지의 수혜자들에게는 오히려 복지가 줄어드는 것은 아닐지 의문이 꼬리에 꼬리를 문다.

기본소득이 화두가 되면서 여전히 많은 사람들이 의구심을 갖고 있다. 하지만, 소모적인 논쟁 대신 기본소득이 정확히 어떤 개념이며, 어떤 원칙을 가진 제도인지 꼼꼼하게 알아볼 필요가 있다. 

어려운 경제개념을 쉽고 재미있게 이해할 수 있도록 만화로 구성된 이 책은 기본소득의 원리와 5대 원칙, 기본소득이 탄생한 역사적 배경과 경제철학을 소개하는 것은 물론이고, 기본소득을 둘러싼 여러 의혹들을 명쾌하게 해명, 실제 입법이 되려면 어떤 숙의 과정이 필요한지, 재원 마련은 어떻게 하는지, 적정한 지급액은 얼마로 추정하는지 등 기본소득을 둘러싼 모든 개념과 궁금증을 해소해준다.

‘금의 가격’은 전 세계적인 경제 위기 때마나 가파른 상승세를 보이며 급등했다. 멀게는 1929년 대공황 때부터 가깝게는 2008년 세계금융위기를 거치며 급등을 반복, 2011년에는 1온스당 장중 1,900달러 선을 돌파하며 사상 최고점을 찍었다. 이를 통해, 경제 위기→양적완화→달러 가치 하락→금의 급등으로 이어지는 흐름이 공식처럼 굳어졌다.

2019년, 코로나 팬데믹이 전 세계를 강타하고, 각국의 경제가 위기에 빠지자, 다시 ‘금의 가격’이 요동치고 있다. 거기에 더해, 이미 바닥을 드러낸 금의 추정 매장량과 달러의 대량 공급 등이 과거 경제 위기 때보다 금의 가격 상승 요인을 더욱 풍부하게 뒷받침하고 있다. 2008년 세계금융위기 때 위기를 기회로 바꿨던 전설적 투자가들이 다시 금에 집중하는 이유다.

PART 1_코로나 팬데믹이 불러온 금의 대시세
위기를 기회로 형성된 금의 대시세

PART 2_기본적인 금 수급 살펴보기
유사 이래 채굴한 금, 20만 톤
채굴과 공급면에서 본 금 가격
금 가격을 움직이는 요인들

PART 3_전 세계 중앙은행과 금 가격의 상관관계
과거 10년에 걸쳐 왕성한 매입을 계속한 공적 부문
중앙은행과 금준비 입장 변화
금 가격의 전환점

PART 4_과거 50년간의 금융, 정치 이벤트와 금의 움직임
반세기 전에 일어난 대변화
1980년- 버블화된 금
위기 시의 달러 뒤에 가라앉은 금
전환기가 된 2000년
2008년 리먼 쇼크 직후 금의 움직임
2013년의 급락장, 프로와 개인이 대치하다

코로나 팬데믹과 전대미문의 금융완화
적극적으로 위험을 무릅쓰기 시작한 FRB
금융 비대화 속에서 반복되는 버블 생성과 붕괴
코로나 팬데믹에 가려진 채권 버블 붕괴 위기

구독경제는, 사용자(구독자)가 일정 기간 동안 일정 금액, 즉 구독료를 내고 원하는 상품이나 서비스를 제공받는 경제활동을 말한다. 이전부터 있었지만, 새롭게 주목받고 있는 유통 서비스이다. 용도에 따라 변화를 추구하고 그에 따른 경험을 누리는 것, 그것이 주는 가치가 매우 중요해진 요즘 시기에 주목하지 않을 수 없다.

현 MZ세대는 직접 하는 요리나, 청소 등 집안일에 들어가는 시간을 아끼고 출퇴근 시간에 들어가는 시간을 아껴서 자신에게 투자하는 것을 선호한다. 자신이 좋아하는 취미활동을 하는 데 시간과 돈과 에너지를 아끼지 않는다. 이러한 현상은 젊은 세대일수록 뚜렷하게 나타난다.

아직 경제활동을 하는 1인 가구라면 내가 가장 중요하기 때문에 무엇을 하든 가장 효율적인 방법을 찾기 마련이다. 내가 가장 즐겁고 행복해지는 방법을 우선적으로 찾으며, 나에게 다양한 경험을 주는 것들에 흔쾌히 마음을 내어줄 것이고 그것들에 가치와 의미를 부여할 것이다. 즉 이러한 소비자의 입맛에 맞추어 소비자가 원하는 유무형의 아이템을 제공한다는 것이 구독경제의 핵심이다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

인간과 시공간이라는 물리적 한계를 넘어 그 속에서 상호 융합 및 공진화하게 될 메타버스 글로벌 시장! 지금까지 계속 관망만 해 왔다면, 이제는 마지막 기회가 될 메타버스에 과감히 탑승하길 바란다. 앞으로 AR·VR 등 XR 기반의 기업들과 AI, 블록체인 기업들이 힘을 합쳐 지속적으로 메타버스 기술 개발을 이끌어가야 할 것이다. 

메타버스 시장은 2020년 50조 원, 2023년 535조 원 이상, 2030년에는 1,700조 원가량 성장할 전망이며, 우리나라는 향후 5년간 2.6조 원의 메타버스 관련 예산을 단계적으로 집행할 예정이다. 그렇다면 그 주인공은 누가 될 것인가? 현재로서는 예측이 불가하지만 문화와 IT 기술, 콘텐츠 강국인 대한민국이 그 주인공이었으면 하는 바람이다. 그리고 그 변화의 바람에 나도 함께할 것이다.

어떻게 하면 이 시대 청년들에게 꿈과 희망을 줄 수 있을까? 이 시대적 과제에 대한 해결책을 모색하고자 뜻을 같이하는 교수 6명이 이 책을 집필하게 되었다. 더 이상 강단에서 지켜보지만 말고 시대에 역행하는 모순을 바로잡아야만 한다는 사명감에서 출발하였다. 

흔히 우리는 기술혁신이 일자리를 빼앗고 소득 양극화를 심화시킬 수 있다고 오해하기 쉽다. 그러나 이는 편견에 지나지 않으며, 불평등 사회를 조장하는 것은 기술혁신이 아니라 그 혁신을 가로막는 제도다. 그 제도 때문에 일자리가 줄어드는 것이다.

제1장 노동시장의 이중구조와 노동조합의 사회적 책임

1. 노동조합이 노동시장 양극화를 만든 모순
기형적인 한국의 노동조합
불평등을 키우는 노동조합
모순에 빠진 한국의 노동운동

2. 노동시장은 왜 단절되었는가
노동법과 노동시장의 괴리
빈익빈부익부 만드는 노동정치
민주화와 노동운동
민주노총과 전투적 노동운동의 모순
노사정의 사회적 대화의 실패
노동의 경제민주화와 기울어진 정책무대
기업의 사회적 책임 및 공공성 강화와 고용의 왜곡
노동조합의 비정상적 운영 관행
낙후된 노동법

3. 노동조합의 사회적 책임은 우리나라만의 문제인가
노동조합의 사회적 책임
자본주의와 노동조합의 사회적 책임
정부와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：미국
정치와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：영국
복지와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：스웨덴
기술혁신과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：독일
고용과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：프랑스와 남부 유럽

4. 디지털 시대의 노동, 무엇을 어떻게 할 것인가
디지털 시대의 노동시장과 노동조합
손 놓고 있는 한국
노동개혁의 방향
일자리문제의 시각부터 바로잡자
중소기업을 고임금 일자리로 만들자
교육훈련을 사회적 권리로 만들자
후진적인 임금고용관행을 바꾸자
노동조합은 사회적 책임 강화에 나서라
노동법을 바꾸자
정치적 결단이 요구된다

제2장 최저임금제도의 역설：2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 부작용

1. 최저임금제도, 왜 사회경제적 논란이 되었나
최저임금제도의 목적
최저임금 결정 과정
2018년~2019년 2년간 29.1% 최저임금 인상안의 문제점

2. 최저임금과 관련된 지표와 통계 자료
최저임금의 인상률 추이：2018년~2019년을 중심으로
2014년~2017년 최저임금 인상률과 인상요인
2018년~2019년 최저임금 인상률과 그 결정요인

3. 2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 영향
최저임금을 지불할 수 없는 사업장 증가：최저임금 미만율 증가
근로자 임금결정 시 정부의 과도한 영향：최저임금 영향률 증가
과도한 최저임금 인상에 의한 소득분배 개선 악화
과도한 최저임금 인상에 ...

메타버스, OTT, 밈테크, 틱톡, 슈퍼 IP, 이커머스, 오리지널 콘텐츠…. 만약 이런 단어가 낯설다면 당신은 세상의 변화에 둔감한 사람일지 모른다. 1020세대의 전유물이라고 치부되던 뉴미디어와 그 매체가 담아내는 독창적인 콘텐츠는 이제 보편적이고 대중적인 문화로 자리 잡아가고 있다. 뿐만 아니라 유튜브와 숏폼의 인기 콘텐츠가 거시적인 사회문화 트렌드의 출발지가 되는 사례가 점차 늘어나면서, 뉴미디어 콘텐츠의 영향력이 커지고 있다.

국내에서 가장 많은 유튜브 빅데이터를 분석하는 MCN 샌드박스네트워크는 이 책에서 사회 변화의 맥락을 짚어내고, 앞으로 전개될 사회문화 트렌드의 변화를 거시적으로 예측한다. 그리고 이를 좀 더 깊이 있게 다루기 위해 10개의 트렌드 키워드 ‘부캐, 팬덤, 숏폼, 호모집쿠스, 밈테크, 메타버스, 오리지널 콘텐츠, e스포츠, 브랜디드 콘텐츠, 알고리즘’을 선정해 분석한다. 이 책을 통해 뉴미디어 산업의 최신 동향부터 시장 전망까지 파악하며, 새로운 비즈니스와 부의 기회를 발견할 수 있을 것이다.

시장이 클수록 혁신에 대한 보상은 증가하며, 이는 더 많은 혁신을 불러온다. 그러나 전 세계 인구의 0.7%에도 미치지 못하지만 세계 10위의 경제 규모를 가지게 된 우리나라는 무역을 통해서 혁신을 자극하는 효과를 누려왔다. 박지형 교수는 한국의 사례를 들어 국내의 인적·물적 자원뿐 아니라 전 세계 자원을 효과적으로 활용해야 지속적 혁신을 할 수 있다고 강조한다.

2021년 글로벌혁신지수(Global Innovation Index)에서 한국은 스위스, 스웨덴, 미국, 영국에 이어 세계 5위의 혁신국가로 평가됐다. 하지만 한국은 ‘기술 융합 역량’은 우수한 편이나 ‘창의적 사고’와 ‘공정하고 유연한 제도’의 면에서는 다른 선진국에 비해 뒤처진다. 이정민 교수는 정부가 충분한 숙려 기간과 사전 검토 기간을 거친 후 정책을 체계적으로 결정해야 엉뚱한 곳으로 투자 자원이 소모되지 않는다고 지적한다.

돈이 무엇인지 설명한다. 세계사의 여러 장면을 조명해 돈이 어떻게 만들어지고, 어떻게 발전해왔는지 알아본다. 지배자들은 돈에 개입해 주화라는 개념을 만들면서 시뇨리지를 챙기고, 지배자들의 더 큰 개입은 훗날 은행으로 발전한다. 

천재 과학자 뉴턴은 영국의 금본위제를 도입하고 이는 산업혁명과 함께 유럽 전체가 금본위제를 도입하게 되는 시발점이 된다. 사실 영국의 금본위제는 우연과 실수의 산물이며 이는 중국과 유럽 사이의 무역 불균형에서 초래한 바가 크다.

한편, 두 번의 세계 대전을 거쳐 미국의 달러는 소위 기축통화의 위치를 얻게 되는데 소위 브레튼 우즈 협약을 통해 미국 달러는 종이로 만든 금의 위치에 오르게 된다. 훗날 IMF는 SDR이라는 형태로 케인스가 주창했던 방코르를 흉내 내고 이는 현재까지도 세계 무역의 기본이 되는 통화다. 

이 밖에도 미국과 일본의 양적완화와 테이퍼링, 인플레이션과 초인플레이션, 현대 통화 이론 등을 살펴보며 미국 정책금리와 통화량의 변화도 알아본다. 전 세계를 뜨겁게 달군 비트코인도 조명한다. 비트코인은 화폐인지, 비트코인은 투자인지 투기인지, FATF와 가상자산은 무엇인지, 암호화폐와 토큰, NFT, DeFi, CBDC, DAO 비트코인과 엘살바도르의 위험한 실험, 디지털 자산의 실체도 자세히 살펴본다.

경제라는 복잡한 세계의 입구에서 갈팡질팡하는 분들을 위해 쓰인 책이다. 비즈니스는 물론이고 정치와 행정 등 모든 사회적 현상의 기초에는 경제 문제가 관련되어 있다. 하지만 일반적인 경제학 입문서나 교과서에는 추상적인 개념만 가득할 뿐, 우리의 실생활과 어떤 관련이 있는지는 찾아보기 어렵다. 

이 책은 ‘가격’이라는, 경제에서 가장 기초가 되는 키워드를 바탕으로 쓰인 책이다. 가격이 상품과 함께 태어나서 자라나는 험난한 여정을 따라가며, 가격이 수행하는 사회적 역할의 크기를 살펴보고 어떤 사람들이 어떻게 가격을 만들고 키워내는지, 그 과정을 거슬러 올라가며 확인할 것이다. 또 사회 속에 존재하는, 가격을 중심으로 한 전반적인 경제 시스템을 탐구해 나갈 것이다.

가격은 ‘우리의 생활’ 그 자체다. 이 책의 의도는 가격 결정 과정에서부터 시작된 경제가 사회에서 실제로 어떻게 작용하는지, 그 생생한 시스템을 보여 주는 것이다. 약속하건대 이 책을 읽는 사람은 누구든 경제가 무엇인지 명확하게 실감할 수 있게 될 것이다.

들어가며 - 옛날에는 주먹밥에 가격이 없었다?
프롤로그 - 가격을 통해 보는 사회 시스템

제1장 우리는 가격에 의지해 구매할 수밖에 없는가?
물건을 산다는 것은 무엇일까? 
사실 구매자는 상품에 대해 잘 모른다 
왜 내가 올 것이라는 것을 미리 알고 있을까? 
우리의 눈은 ‘이안 반사식 카메라’ 
가격은 경제의 ‘키 플레이어’

제2장 경제의 이모저모는 가격이 조정한다
전제: 시장경제란 무엇일까 
매매에서는 ‘가격’과 ‘수량’이 문제 
‘가격 메커니즘’ - 가격이 움직이면 수량도 움직인다 
경매에서는 ‘가격 메커니즘’이 작동한다 
가격 메커니즘은 그래프로 나타낼 수 있다 

제3장 투입한 생산비용을 회수할 수 있을까?
상품을 생산한다는 것은 무엇일까? 
상품이 팔리지 않는 것이 가장 큰 문제 
이익을 키우는 방법 
리스크가 적은 행동을 선택한다 
드디어 출하! 
가격은 생산자의 생명줄

제4장 가격은 어떻게 결정되는가?
현실의 시장은 어떤 시스템인가? 
시장에는 상품도 기업도 모여든다 
도매상을 중심으로 사고팔다 
경매 거래로 공정한 가격을 만든다 
시장이라는 시스템을 
경제학적으로 생각해 보자 
경매의 구조 
수요와 공급은 어떻게 가격을 결정할까

제5장 전부 팔아 치우기 위한 전략적 가격 결정
소매상에 있어 가격이란 무엇일까? 
상점에서는 가격을 어떻게 결정할까? 
소비자는 어떻게 판단할까? 
소비자의 ‘실속있는 소비’, 그 적정 가격은? 
타점포와의 가격 경쟁도 있다 
‘가격을 파는’ 전략을 취한다 
이렇게 해서 가격이 결정된다

제6장 최후의 관문, 소비자의 ‘까다로운 눈’
적절한 가격을 순간적으로 판단하는 기준은? 
쇼핑의 심리와 행동의 흐름 
우리는 매번 합리적으로 판단하지는 않는다 
판매자가 교묘히 이용하는 쇼핑 심리 
우리도 경험을 쌓아 직감을 기르자

덧붙이는 장 눈에 보이지 않는 가격도 있다
칼럼① 무료여도 괜찮을까? 
칼럼② 보이지 않는 가격에는 어떤 의미가 있을까? 
칼럼③ 가격의 끝자리를 주목하자 
칼럼④ ...

대학에서 지난 수년간 “소프트웨어 프로그래밍(파이썬)” 과목을 강의하면서 다양한 교과서를 살펴보았다. 어떤 서적은 한 학기에 파이썬 교육을 완성하기에 분량이 너무 많았고 시간이 부족해서 적절한 교과서를 찾기 쉽지 않았다. 연세대 강의는 전교의 다양한 학생들이 수강하고 있으며 거의 대부분의 수강생들이 프로그래밍 배경이 전혀 없는 상태이다. 실제 강의는 매주 강의 2시간 및 실습(LAB) 2시간으로 진행해 왔다. 이러한 요구와 여건에 맞추어 이 책을 저술하게 되었다. 

이 책은 실제 강의 내용에 기반하여 LAB 내용(연습문제의 B. 따라하기 실습 및 C. 프로그래밍 실습)을 구성하였다. 수강생들은 LAB 내용(B. 따라하기 실습)을 그대로 따라함으로써 파이썬 언어를 익히고, 간단한 프로그래밍 문제(C. 프로그래밍 실습)를 LAB 시간 내에 완성하는 방식을 따랐다. 이 책을 사용하는 모든 사람이 이와 동일한 방법으로 비교적 단시간 내에 파이썬 언어의 모든 것을 배우고 활용 능력을 발휘해 나갈 수 있을 것이다.
