        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weak labor markets typically lead young workers to invest in skills. High unemployment during COVID diverged from prior downturns: enrollment at community colleges dropped by 9.5 percent between 2019 and 2020, with the drop larger among men. COVID disruptions generated supply-side impacts on courses of study requiring significant capital and “hands on” experiential learning, particularly programs that deliver of assembly, repair and maintenance (ARM) skills. Community colleges that had relative concentrations of credentials in ARM fields pre-pandemic experienced relatively large enrollment declines. The decline in ARM enrollment explains nearly all the difference in enrollment declines by gender during COVID.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We develop a Ricardian model of trade in which countries innovate ideas that diffuse across the globe. In this model, the forces of innovation and diffusion combine to shape trade substitution patterns. Innovation makes a country technologically distinct, reducing their substitutability with other countries, while diffusion between countries generates technological similarity and increases head-to-head competition. In the special case of an innovation-only model where countries do not share ideas, productivities are independent across space, and the demand system is CES. As a consequence, departures from CES expenditure reveal diffusion patterns. Our theoretical results provide a mapping between the dynamics of observable trade flows and the dynamics of innovation and knowledge diffusion.]]></summary>

Preventing poor decisions may require timely transfer of financial control to a reliable agent. Cognitive decline, however, can develop unnoticed, creating the possibility of suboptimal timing of the transfer of control.

Our strategy identifies financial shocks as high-frequency changes in the market value of intermediaries' net worth in a narrow window around their earnings announcements, based on U.S. tick-by-tick data. Using these shocks, we estimate that news of a 1-percent decline in intermediaries' net worth leads to a 0.2-0.4 percent decrease in the market value of nonfinancial firms.  These effects are more pronounced for firms with high default risk and low liquidity and when the aggregate net worth of intermediaries is low.]]></summary>

We study how author-editor and author-reviewer network connectivity and “match” influences editor decisions and reviewer recommendations of economic research at the Journal of Human Resources (JHR). Our empirical strategy employs several dimensions of fixed effects to overcome concerns of endogenous assignment of papers to editors and reviewers in order to identify causal impacts. Results show that clubs and networks play a large role in influencing both editor and reviewer decisions. Authors who attended the same PhD program, were ever colleagues with, are affiliates of the same NBER program(s), or are more closely linked via coauthorship networks as the handling editor are significantly more likely to avoid a desk rejection. Likewise, authors from the same PhD program or who previously worked with the reviewer are significantly more likely to receive a positive evaluation. We also find that sharing “signals” of ability, such as publishing in “top five”, attending a high ranked PhD program, or being employed by a similarly ranked economics department significantly influences editor decisions and/or reviewer recommendations.]]></summary>

This lowers the issuers' interest burden and allows the government to run a permanent (primary) deficit without ever paying back its debt. As idiosyncratic risk rises during recessions, so does the value of the service flows bestowing the safe asset with a negative beta. This resolves government debt valuation puzzles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though air-quality alert systems (AQAS) cover more than 1.7 billion people worldwide, there has been little welfare analysis of these systems. This paper presents a theoretical framework for deriving lower bounds on the net benefits of an AQAS and applies it to a South Korean system currently covering over 51 million people. Estimating a regression discontinuity design, we find that an alert issuance reduced youth respiratory expenditures by 30% and adult cardiovascular expenditures by 23%. The overall system reduced externalized health expenditures by 28.6 million dollars during 2016–2017, with a minimum benefit-cost ratio of 7.1:1. Including dynamic impacts of alerts increases the minimum benefits (benefit-cost ratio) to 36.7 million dollars (9.2:1). Our findings imply that the AQAS generates significant net benefits and suggests that manipulation of air quality data, which has been observed in other contexts, may negatively impact social welfare.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How is macroeconomic research conducted and what is it trying to accomplish? We explore these questions using information gleaned from 1,894 articles published in ten leading journals. We find that over the past 40 years there has been a growing emphasis on increasingly sophisticated quantitative theory, such as DSGE modeling, and papers employing these methods now account for the majority of articles in macro journals. The shift towards quantitative theory is mirrored by a decline in the use of econometric methods to test economic hypotheses.  Econometric techniques borrowed from applied microeconomics have to a large extent displaced time series methods, and empirical papers increasingly rely on micro and proprietary data sources. Market imperfections are pervasive, and the amount of research involving financial frictions has increased significantly in the past ten years. The frequency with which non-macro JEL codes appear in macro articles indicates a great deal of overlap between macroeconomics and other fields.]]></summary>

Counterfactual analysis reveals that eliminating earnings misreporting completely through disclosure regulation incentivizes managers to distort real investment.

On average, firms exposed by the anti-corruption program grow larger after the audits, despite experiencing a decrease in procurement contracts. We manually collect new data on the details of thousands of corruption cases, through which we uncover a large heterogeneity in our firm-level effects depending on the degree of involvement in corruption cases. Using investment-, loan-, and worker- level data, we show that the average exposed firms adapt to the loss of government contracts by changing their investment strategy. They increase capital investment and borrow more to finance such investment, while there is no change in their internal organization.  We provide qualitative support to our results by conducting new face-to-face surveys with business owners of government-dependent firms.]]></summary>

We develop a dynamic model in which an entrepreneur borrows from overlapping-generation households via layers of funds, forming a credit chain. Each intermediary fund in the chain faces rollover risks from its lenders, and the optimal debt contracts among layers are time invariant and layer independent. The model delivers new insights regarding the benefits of intermediation via layers: the chain structure insulates interim negative fundamental shocks and protects the underlying cash flows from being discounted heavily during bad times, resulting in a greater borrowing capacity. We show that the equilibrium chain length minimizes the run risk for any given contract and find that restricting credit chain length can improve total welfare once the available funding from households has been endogenized.]]></summary>

• Occupancy: 45.4% (-14.9%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $119.92 (-4.8%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $54.47 (-19.0%)
Occupancy fell week over week because of a slowdown in leisure demand and a continued absence of business travel due to a Saturday holiday. While ADR also dropped from an all-time high the previous week, the metric came in at roughly 95% of the 2019 comparable. ...
  
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.

Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in December. Inventory was down 17.7% in December month-over-month (MoM) from November, and down 30.0% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in December, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 26.2% YoY, so the YoY decline in December is larger than in November. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

A brief excerpt: 
The general rule of thumb is refinance activity will be strong if current mortgage rates are 50bps lower than the maximum of the previous year (this is just a general rule - but it works pretty well).
The following graph shows the MBA Refinance Index (Blue) and the change in mortgage rates (Red). The change is calculated as Maximum in Previous Year minus the current rate). When the red line is above 0.5% (more than 50bps decline in mortgage rates), then refinance activity generally picks up.
Currently the maximum for the last year is 3.22% (excluding this week), and with current rates at 3.59%, refinance activity will probably decline significantly over the next few weeks.

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.5 percent   in December on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in November,   the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months,   the all items index increased 7.0 percent before seasonal adjustment.
Increases in the indexes for shelter and for used cars and trucks were the   largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food   index also contributed, although it increased less than in recent months,   rising 0.5 percent in December. The energy index declined in December, ending   a long series of increases; it fell 0.4 percent as the indexes for gasoline   and natural gas both decreased. 
  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in December   following a 0.5-percent increase in November. This was the sixth time in   the last 9 months it has increased at least 0.5 percent. Along with the   indexes for shelter and for used cars and trucks, the indexes for household   furnishings and operations, apparel, new vehicles, and medical care all   increased in December. As in November, the indexes for motor vehicle insurance   and recreation were among the few to decline over the month.
 The all items index rose 7.0 percent for the 12 months ending December, the   largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1982. The all items   less food and energy index rose 5.5 percent, the largest 12-month change   since the period ending February 1991. The energy index rose 29.3 percent   over the last year, and the food index increased 6.3 percent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2006 I disagreed with some analysts on the outlook for the Inland Empire in California.  I wrote: 
As the housing bubble unwinds, housing related employment will fall; and fall dramatically in areas like the Inland Empire. The more an area is dependent on housing, the larger the negative impact on the local economy will be.
So I think some pundits have it backwards: Instead of a strong local economy keeping housing afloat, I think the bursting housing bubble will significantly impact housing dependent local economies.
And sure enough, the economies of housing dependent areas like the Inland Empire were devastated during the housing bust.  However, prior to the pandemic, the Inland Empire was coming back strong.
 Click on graph for larger image.
This graph shows the unemployment rate for the Inland Empire (using MSA: Riverside, San Bernardino, Ontario), and also the number of construction jobs as a percent of total employment.
The unemployment rate was falling before the pandemic and was down to 3.6% (down from 14.4% in 2010).  During the pandemic, the unemployment rate increased to 15.2%, but is down to 5.4%.

 And construction employment is up from the lows (as a percent of total employment), but still well below the bubble years.
So, the Inland Empire economy isn't as heavily depending on construction as during the bubble.
The second graph shows the number of construction jobs as a percent of total employment for the Inland Empire, all of California, and the entire U.S.
Clearly the Inland Empire is more dependent on construction than most areas.  Construction employment - as a percent of total employment - has picked up but is still below the levels during the housing bubble.]]></summary>

Here is Rick’s summary of builder comments for various markets (emphasis added in bold):
Home builder survey results are in for full month of December. Top themes: 1) Still a ton of demand for new homes. 2) Rampant construction material & labor shortages. 3) Bit of chatter on possible margin compression several quarters ahead. Market commentary to follow…
#Atlanta builder: “Have virtually no available inventory & huge backlog of 1,000+ units going in to 2022. Still metering sales in most communities, where the demand of waiting buyers still outnumbers our supply.”
#LasVegas builder: “Busiest orders for December I can remember in a long time.”
#Charlotte builder: “Haven’t seen this hot of a new homebuilding market in 27 years in Charlotte. Reminds me of the go-go days in the late 1980's right before the S & L's (Savings & Loan Crisis) rocked my new homebuilding world in Southern California.”

Most of the 5.0mn persons who have exited the labor force since the start of the pandemic are over age 55 (3.4mn), largely reflecting early (1.5mn) and natural (1mn) retirements that likely won’t reverse.

The Dodge Momentum Index fell 3% in December to 166.4 (2000=100), down from the revised November reading of 170.7. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Construction Network, is a monthly measure of the initial report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year. In December, commercial planning fell 4%, and institutional planning slipped 1%.
Despite these declines, 2021 was a banner year for the Dodge Momentum Index — despite the lingering risks of COVID-19 and low demand for some types of nonresidential buildings. Throughout the year, the overall Momentum Index increased 23%, the strongest annual gain since 2005. Both the commercial and institutional components of the Momentum Index saw similar gains — with their levels of activity reaching 13- and 14-year highs, respectively.

웹 크롤링은 세 가지 기본 개념과 방법만 손에 익히면 입문자도 충분히 구현할 수 있는 기술이다. BeautifulSoup 라이브러리를 이용한 파싱, 동적 웹 페이지를 다루는 Selenium 라이브러리, 그리고 오픈 데이터를 활용하는 API 기술이 그것이다. 다만 이 기술을 제대로 아는 게 중요하다. 이 책은 입문자도 쉽게 따라올 수 있도록 기초부터 차근차근 크롤링 기술의 개념과 방법을 단계적으로 학습하도록 돕는다.

21세기에 들어서고 20여 년이 지났다. 대한민국은 지금 어떤 역사경로를 통과하면서 미래를 향해 나아가고 있을까? 국가 리더십이 흔들리는 대한민국에서 정치 환경은 갈수록 나빠지고 있으며, 경제는 새로운 성장동력을 찾지 못하고 있다. 국민의 일상이 분노와 불신으로 뒤덮여 있다. 화합과 통합으로 나아가야 할 대한민국이 갈등과 분열로 인해 퇴보하고 있다는 의견도 많다.

대한민국이 20세기에 빈손에서 출발해 세계적인 경제 강국으로 도약했다. 그렇지만 21세기 들어 대한민국은 퇴조의 물살에 휩쓸려 허덕이고 있으며, 심지어 잘못된 이념에 의해 국가 발전은 물론 국민의 삶까지 위협받고 있다. 

대한민국은 자유민주주의와 자유시장경제라는 이념을 기초로 세워진 나라였고, 이를 기반으로 삼아 번영했다. 정치와 경제에서도 강력한 에너지와 역동성을 지닌 나라였다. 그러나 현재 대한민국은 그 역동성을 잃어가고 있다. 이 책에서는 그 역동성이 무엇인지, 현재 그 역동성을 왜 잃어가고 있는지 등 대한민국의 현재 상황을 시민의 눈으로 그 원인과 사회를 분석하고 문제에 대한 대안을 제시하였다.

Expectations of negative inflation can be particularly harmful and lead to deflationary spirals when nominal interest rates are near zero. This column uses survey evidence to show that households and firms almost never expect deflation, even when it is a clear possibility. This apparent zero lower bound on inflation expectations has important implications for macroeconomic dynamics and the effectiveness of monetary policy. Unconventional policies, such as forward guidance, which aim to increase inflation expectations may be less effective when expectations are stuck at the zero lower bound.]]></summary>

A brief excerpt: 
Commenting on the slowdown in sales, Dick Beeson, managing broker at RE/MAX Northwest Realtors, said, "That's to be expected considering inventory in the fourth quarter was down sharply from last year. You can't sell what isn't there."
...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in December. Inventory was down 22.7% in December month-over-month (MoM) from November, and down 34.2% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in December, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 30.5% YoY, so the YoY decline in December is larger than in November. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

Inventory usually declines sharply over the holidays, and this is a new record low for this series.
Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of January 7th, inventory was at 292 thousand (7-day average), compared to 397 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 26.0%.  Inventory was down 0.5% from the previous week.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 46.2% from 738 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 294 thousand, and was down 30.0% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April 2021 - very late - usually inventory bottoms in January or February. The YoY decline this week was smaller than last week, and that might be a sign that inventory will bottom seasonally in January or February this year.


Inventory peaked last year in early September, when inventory was at 437 thousand, so inventory is currently off about 33.2% from the peak for 2021.

디지털 공간에 현실과 비슷한 환경을 조성하는 것이 바로 디지털 테라포밍이다. 메타버스를 통해 현실의 많은 요소들이 디지털 공간 속에 구현되면서 점차 현실에서 가상으로 일상이 이동하고 있다. 앞으로 메타버스는 우리의 일상을 어떻게 변화시킬까? 우리는 변화의 중심에서 무엇을 알아야 할까? 변화하는 시대에 여유롭게 대처하기 위해서는 메타버스를 둘러싼 기본적인 요소들을 이해해야 한다.

메타버스는 새로운 개념이 아니다. 인지하지 못했지만 이미 우리가 사용하고 있었던 것이기도 하다. 이 책을 통해 메타버스와 이에 관한 다양한 사회적 현상들을 알아 감으로써 미래의 변화를 두려워하기보다는 주도적으로 활용하며 생활할 수 있기를 바란다.

어느 정도 프로그래밍 경험이 있는 독자를 대상으로, 오픈 소스 데이터 분석 도구인 R을 활용하여 데이터를 불러들이고, 가공하고, 시각화하는 방법을 설명한다. 이 책은 시중의 책들과 달리 특정한 기능을 하는 함수들을 설명하기 전에 데이터 전처리의 목적과 기능에 대한 개념적인 이해를 우선 할 수 있도록 도와준다. 그리고 날짜시간 자료형, 문자열 자료형, 정규표현식 등에 대한 원리와 응용 방법을 자세하게 설명하여 복잡한 전처리 과정에서도 논리적 오류를 범하지 않도록 한다. 

분산처리 없이 빅데이터 처리를 할 수 있는 마지막 보류인 데이터테이블을 dplyr 패키지의 함수와 비교하여 이해를 도왔고,ggplot2의 설명에서는 플롯의 수많은 옵션을 정하는 방법을 한 눈에 보기 싶게 보여준다. 그 밖에도 부록으로 RStudio의 치트시트를 수록하였다. 어느 정도 R에 익숙한 독자들에게도 R의 데이터 전처리와 시각화에 대해 좀 더 깊이 알 수 있게 하였다.

Since most horizontal mergers generate incentives to increase prices and/or reduce output, the presumption seems to be that the resulting efficiencies must be sizeable to make them good for consumers. This column uses a novel database covering over 1,000 mergers scrutinised by the European Commission and shows that, under certain assumptions, compensating efficiencies appear too large to be achievable for a large part of the mergers in the sample. The Commission's view on required efficiencies might have been too optimistic and it appears to have been too lax in enforcing its merger policy.]]></summary>

기본소득의 핵심 쟁점인 재원 마련에 대해 다루고 있다. 기본소득과 취지가 중복되거나 사회적 형평성을 해치거나 시장 기능에 왜곡을 초래하는 각종 세제혜택과 보조금, 복지제도를 구조조정함으로써 기본소득을 마련하자는 것이다. 더불어 기존 복지제도에 비해 기본소득이 어떤 장점을 지니고 있는지에 대해서도 기술했다. 최근 우리 사회에 제기된 기본소득 논쟁에 조금이나마 보탬이 되고자 하는 소망이 담겨 있다.

들어가며

기본소득이란 무엇인가
기본소득의 철학적 기반
모든 사람에게 나눠주자고? 그럼 돈은 어디서?
기본소득과 중복되는 세금을 정비하자
‘세제개혁’만으로 48.6조 아낄 수 있다
중복되는 복지제도를 정비하자
정치적 수용 가능성: 기본소득이 복지를 축소시켜서는 안 된다
기본소득 얼마나 가능할까
기본소득과 노동
기본소득과 최저임금
기본소득과 재정환상
기본소득, 만병통치약은 아니다

맺음말 - 재벌에게도 기본소득을 -

A brief excerpt: 
From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Recent reports showing a surge in investor purchases of single-family homes beginning last spring has stunned quite a few housing analysts and led several to reassess the “drivers” of the surprising strength in housing and home prices this year.
One of the reports I’m referring to is from Redfin, and the other is from CoreLogic. While both are based on an analysis of property records, there are key differences.
Before going into some of the potential ramifications of this investor surge, however, I thought it might be useful to discuss these reports – especially in light of a recent “research” report from the trade association “dedicated to advocating on behalf of the single-family rental industry” that completed botched its analysis of these recent reports.

신상준 지음 / 생각의창 / 2022년 01월 / ISBN:9791197017285
정가: 16,500원 / 판매가: 14,850원 / 마일리지: 820원

‘한국은행의 돈 박사’라 불리는 신상준 박사의 ‘돈의 본질’에 대한 인문학적 이야기다. ‘돈이란 무엇인가?’에 대한 해답을 찾아가며, 돈의 모든 것에 대해 강의하듯 설명하고 있다. 야프섬의 돌화폐에서 비트코인까지 돈에 대한 모든 것을 다루면서도, 돈을 통해 흐르는 경제 문제까지 짚어준다.

“종잇조각에 불과한 우리의 지폐가 야프섬의 돌화폐보다 더 큰 가치를 가지고 있을까? 우리의 예금은 어떠한가? 전자적으로만 이체되는 우리의 예금이 구두로만 이전되는 야프섬의 돌화폐와 크게 다를까?”

저자 신상준 박사는 이와 같은 화두를 던지며 독자들과 대화를 시도한다. 돈의 근저에 깔린 ‘가치의 본질’에 대해 이야기하고, 주관적 가치를 객관적 객체에 고정시키고자 한 ‘화폐의 역사’에 대해 이야기한다. 그리고 시대마다 상이한 ‘돈의 철학’과 이를 통해 형성된 ‘돈의 본질’에 대한 다양한 견해를 나눈다. 더 나아가 돈을 둘러싼 ‘권력과 돈의 이데올로기’에 대해 이야기한다.

17세기 튤립 파동에서 21세기 비트코인 열풍에 이르기까지 400년 동안 전 세계를 뒤흔든 42가지 상품 시장의 역사적 사건들을 소개한다. 밀, 설탕, 금, 구리, 원유, 천연가스, 희토류, 오렌지주스 등 각 시대를 대표하는 원자재들의 거래 과정을 엿보며 경제사를 투자의 관점에서 흥미롭게 이해할 수 있다. 

수요나 공급의 일시적인 불균형이 어떻게 개별 상품 시장에 영향을 미치는지를 보여주고, 나아가 극단적인 가격 변동 외에도 개개인의 운명을 결정짓는 투기와 수익, 손실에 대한 비하인드 스토리를 만나게 된다. 시장과 사건들이 얽히면서 보여주는 역사를 통해 우리는 보다 날카롭고 확장된 시야로 투자의 미래를 예측할 수 있다.

투기의 세계사에서 1, 2위를 다투는 튤립 파동으로 시작해 비트코인 열풍으로 끝을 맺으며 연대기 순으로 사건들을 소개하고 있다. 1장에서 6장까지는 17~19세기에 벌어진 주요 사건을 다룬다. 역사에 기록된 최초의 시장 붕괴 사건인 네덜란드 튤립 파동부터 오늘날 주식 시장에서 사용되는 캔들 차트가 만들어진 일본의 쌀시장, 원유 시대의 시작을 알린 록펠러의 전략과 스탠더드 오일의 부흥, 미국 밀 시장 조작 사건과 캘리포니아 골드러시까지 다양한 이야기가 쏟아진다.

2020년 3월 1일, 안드로이드 스튜디오의 버전 번호 시스템이 인텔리제이 IDEA와 일치하도록 연도 표기로 변경되었다. 또한 각 버전 이름도 A~Z로 시작하는 동물의 이름으로 변경되어 기존의 '안드로이드 스튜디오 4.3' 버전이 '안드로이드 스튜디오 Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1'로 바뀌었다. 이러한 변화에 맞춰 개정 3판을 펴냈다.

3판에서는 Arctic Fox 추가 기능을 모두 반영했으며, Bumblebee와 Chipmunk 베타 버전에서도 실습할 수 있다. 그리고 안드로이드에서 더는 사용하지 않는 구형 코틀린 코드를 수정했다. 또한 파이어베이스 실습 프로젝트(클라우드 메시징(FCM) 등)를 추가했다. 최신 버전으로 실습 환경을 제공한다.

코로나 이후 우리가 일하는 모습을 상상해보자. 마이크로소프트사의 홀로렌즈를 머리에 장착하고 현실 세계에 가상 세계를 융합한 혼합 현실에서 원격회의를 진행한다. 구글 줌을 통해 캘리포니아에 사는 존과 화상 회의를 진행한다. AI가 실시간 통역을 해줘 의사소통에 전혀 불편을 느끼지 못한다.  크라우드 스트라이크사의 완벽한 클라우드 보안으로 개인 컴퓨터를 사용해도 해킹의 염려가 없다.

사무실에 출근하는 날은 아마존의 로보택시를 이용한다. 아마존은 2020년에 자율주행 기술을 연구하는 벤처 기업 Zoox를 인수한 후 이 사업을 추진해왔다. 로보택시 안에 설치된 모니터에서는 아마존이 고객으로부터 얻은 빅데이터를 바탕으로 맞춤형 광고 영상이 나온다. 출장을 가게 될 때는 애플호텔에 묵는다. 호텔 방의 터치 패널에 아이폰을 갖다 대면, 환기 조절, 조명, 음향 등이 자신이 원하는 환경으로 바뀐다. 비용은 추가 할인을 받을 수 있는 애플카드로 결제한다. 점심으로 콩고기로 된 스테이크를 먹고, 쉬는 시간에는 넷플릭스에서 내 취향에 맞게 결말이 바뀐 영화를 본다.

위의 내용은 《빅테크 미래보고서 2025》의 서두에서 그려본 미래 모습의 일부분이다. 추측과 가정으로 이루어져 있지만, 빅테크 기업의 기술과 비즈니스가 앞으로 어떠한 방향으…]]></summary>

〈이코노미스트〉가 꼽은 2022년 새해 경제 주요 이슈들이다. 이에 대한 전망과 향방을 내다본 『2022 경제 대예측』을 펴냈다. 〈이코노미스트〉는 중앙일보·JTBC 등으로 이뤄진 중앙그룹이 발행하는 프리미엄 경제 전문 뉴스로 1984년 창간해 한국의 경제 발전 역사와 함께 걸어왔다. 최근에는 경제 매거진에 이어 온라인 데일리 경제 뉴스도 제작해 매일 매일 독자들에게 경제 소식을 전하고 있다. 

〈이코노미스트〉가 제작하는 『경제 대예측』은 2008년 출판 등록해 지금까지 해마다 발행하고 있는 대내외 경제 전망서다. 지난해 경제 상황을 돌아보고 새해 경제 쟁점을 전망하는 책이다. 경제 현장에서 뛰고 있는 경제 전문 기자들이 낱낱이 해부한 분석력과, 관련 업계의 정책·통계·동향 등을 통해 현상을 꿰뚫는 경제기관 전문가들의 통찰력으로 대내외 경제 이정표를 제시하는 전망서다. 

이들의 시각을 통해 Yes와 No의 답변과 확률로 가능성을 제시하고 있다. 2021년초에 펴낸 『2021 경제 대예측』은 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)의 전세계 대유행으로 셧다운(정지) 된 세계경제에 대해 2021년에는 ‘V자형 반등’으로 회복할 것으로 전망했으며 이 예측은 적중했다.

경제학이 담지 못한 ‘행복’의 본질을 찾아서, 진정한 행복은 자신의 잠재력을 실현하는 것이다. 현대 한국인의 행복에는 크게 두 가지 문제가 있다. 평균 행복도가 낮은 것과 연령대가 높아질수록 행복도가 하락하는 것. 저자는 인간의 행복은 자신이 사는 사회체제와 무관하지 않다는 생각을 바탕으로 이러한 저행복의 원인을 시장경제 체제에서 찾는다. 교육, 직장 등 삶의 주요한 영역에서 이루어지는 경쟁이 협력과 공감의 감정을 사라지게 했고, 가까운 사람들마저 경쟁자로 여기면서 행복에 중요한 영향을 주는 관계재가 줄어들었다는 것이다.

저자는 그동안 경제학에서 제시한 다양한 행복의 정의를 비판적으로 검토하면서 경제학이 담지 못한 행복의 본질은 무엇인가 질문을 던진다. 경제학자들의 주장대로 실질소득이 증가하여 소비가 크게 확대되었지만 행복은 상승하지 않았다. 오히려 점점 심화되는 불평등과 차별이 행복을 낮추고 있다. 이에 저자는 기존 경제학의 틀을 넘어서는 새로운 시각으로 행복을 정의한다.

 “진정한 행복은 자신의 잠재력을 실현하는 것”이라는 저자의 행복 정의는 경제학의 각종 지표들이 담지 못한 실제 우리 삶의 이야기면서, 시장경제 체제의 산물도 아니며, 소확행보다 더 넓은 시선으로 인생 전체를 그릴 수 있게 한다. 즉 행복을 내적인 감정이 아닌 현실을 바라보는 시각으로서 제시한 것이다. 이때 자기실현은 홀로 깨달음을 통해 얻는 것이 아니라 사회 속에서 성취하는 것이다. 사회구성원으로서 각자가 자기실현을 위해 노력하고, 서로 협력할수록 행복은 커진다.

대한민국의 불평등을 객관적인 통계를 통해 파헤친 최초의 책이다. 대한민국의 불평등 지표인 가처분소득과 지니계수, 상대적 빈곤율은 OECD 회원국 가운데서 맨 밑바닥에 있다. 이러한 문제는 대한민국이 선진국에 진입했다고 해서 해소되지 않는다. 

이 책은 우리나라가 성장과 발전을 거듭해오는 동안 놓친 노동, 청년, 지방의 불평등은 무엇인지를 통계 제시로 보여준다. 또한, 각종 배제와 소외에 놓인 여성, 노인 그리고 소수자의 삶을 통계를 분석하며 꼼꼼히 살핀다.

선진국 대한민국의 국민은 과연 행복한가? 왜 그들은 늘 힘들고 불안한 삶을 살고 있는가? 그들은 어떤 상황에 놓여 있으며, 그렇게 된 원인은 무엇일까? 이는 곧 불평등의 근원인 노동의 문제로 귀결된다. 『불평등한 선진국』은 대한민국의 노동 현실을 다층적인 통계를 통해서 보여준다. 나아가 저자는 불평등의 중심에 있는 청년 문제를, 소득과 교육 불평등의 통계로  그것의 구조화를 규명한다. 한편 이 책은 우리 사회의 소수자인 결혼 이주 여성과 이주 노동자, 장애인과 여성의 구체적 모습을 놓치지 않는다. 

불평등 문제는 어떻게 해결되어야 하는가? 『불평등한 선진국』은 먼저 대한민국의 불평등을 통계로 볼 것을 제안하고 촉구한다. 그것이 우리의 현실에 대한 고민의 시작이며 대안에 대한 모색이기 때문이다.

한국의 경제ㆍ사회 현실과 다가올 미래의 맥락에서 우리 교육을 경제학적 관점에서 평가하고 분석한 책이다. 특히 효율성, 형평성, 타당성이라는 세 가지 평가 기준을 가지고 우리나라 교육의 역사적 흐름과 현주소를 진단하고, 나아가 피라미드형 교육경쟁사회의 입시제도, 사교육 및 사회자본의 현실 및 문제의 진단과 분석, 인공지능 시대의 교육의 방향과 대안 등을 실증적 연구 데이터에 대한 분석과 현장의 교육 실험 등을 통해 제시한다.

2009년 조사 기준 우리나라 학생들의 주당 공부시간은 초등학생은 44시간, 중학생 52시간, 고등학생 64시간. 2019년 OECD 국가 기준 수학 점수 1위, 그러나 학습효율성지수는 꼴지!  비효율적인 선행ㆍ반복학습 위주의 공부 중노동을 강제하는 교육 외적인 현실에 대한 분석과 왜곡된 사회구조에 대한 진단과 분석을 통해 우리 교육의 문제점을 살펴보고 교육의 효율성과 타당성, 형평성의 관계를 생각해본다.

국가들 간의 상이한 경제성장률은 각국에서의 ‘분배연합들’과 ‘특별이익집단들’을 명시적으로 살펴봄으로써 이해될 수 있다. 오랫동안 정해진 경계선이 변하지 않은 ‘안정된 사회들’에서 시간이 지남에 따라 더 많은 분배연합들이 축적됨으로써 그 사회의 경제적 효율성과 경제성장에 해로운 영향을 미쳐서 궁극적으로 ‘제도경화증’(institutional sclerosis)이 초래되고, 마침내 국가는 쇠퇴의 길을 걷게 된다.

넷플릭스를 통해 세상을 강타한 ‘오징어 게임’은 사실 ‘제로섬 게임’이다. 내가 이기면 네가 지고 네가 이기면 내가 지는 그런 게임 말이다. 제로섬 게임은 두 개인, 두 기업 등 두 주체 간의 이기고 지는 게임이기도 하지만, 이기는 주체도 지는 주체도 여럿인 게임이기도 하다. 그래서 제로섬 게임에서는 주체들이 얻은 이익을 순서대로 줄을 세워 석차로 나타낼 수 있다. 이익의 양이 아니라 석차만이 의미가 있다.
이 책에서 내가 주장하고 싶은 본질은 후반부의 대책 편에 있다. 혹시나 앞 편을 읽다가 후반부는 읽지 않으면 어쩌나 염려된다. 궁금하신 분들은 후반부터 읽어도 무방하겠다.

자본주의의 태동부터 지금까지, 금융의 세계에 뛰어든 수많은 참여자는 혁신, 실수 그리고 의도하지 않았던 추문을 통해 지금의 월스트리트를 만들었다. 미국의 억만장자 투자자 겸 피셔 인베스트먼트 설립자이자 33년 동안 《포브스》에 칼럼을 연재한 칼럼니스트 켄 피셔는 자신만의 기준에 따라 월스트리트를 만든 100명의 인물을 선발하여 그들의 업적, 사건, 사생활 등을 매력적인 문체로 풀어냈다. 

그가 선정한 100명이 모두 존경할 만한 인물은 아니다. 하지만 경제학자부터 언론인, 사기범, 투기꾼까지 다양한 분야의 인물로 구성된 이들은 어떤 형태로든 현재의 금융 시장에 절대적인 영향을 미쳤고, 우리는 이들의 짧은 전기를 통해 자본주의를 바라보는 올바른 시각을 얻을 수 있다. 

켄 피셔는 자본주의의 역사 속에서 명예 혹은 불명예를 얻은 100명을 조명하며, 이들의 이야기가 현재에 전하는 메시지가 무엇인지 고찰한다. 그것은 과거는 반복된다는 점이고, 과거를 알지 못하는 자는 실패를 반복하게 된다는 것이다.

미 피어슨(Pearson) 사 특유의 내용의 깊이가 상당한 프로그래밍 언어 고급서 시리즈 중 데이텔 앤 어소시에이츠 사의 ‘Python for Programmers’가 오랜만에 번역판으로 나왔다. 특히 이 책은 “파이썬 하면 인공지능 언어”라는 기대를 저버리지 않을 만큼 최신 인공지능과 데이터과학의 이슈를 빠짐없이 망라하여 다양한 실제 사례와 함께 소개한다. 

타 고급 언어에 대한 배경 지식이 있는 프로그래머를 대상으로 하기도 하지만 실습 지침을 사용하여 파이썬(Python)을 첨단 컴퓨팅 기술과 프로그래밍을 알려주는 데 주안점을 둔다. 개별 스니펫에서 40개의 대형 스크립트 및 전체 구현 사례 연구에 이르는 500개 이상의 실제 예제와 관련된 주피터 노트북 코드와 함께 대화형 IPython 인터프리터를 사용하여 최신 파이썬 코딩 관용구를 빠르게 마스터할 수 있다.

반도체는 ‘21세기의 전략물자’, ‘산업의 쌀’이라 불리며 휴대폰, PC, 자동차 등의 생산에 꼭 필요한 현대산업에 없어서는 안 될 중요 자원으로 손꼽힌다. 이미 기업 간의 경쟁을 넘어 국가 대 국가로 번지고 있던 반도체 패권을 향한 각국의 움직임이 2020년, 코로나19로 인해 자동차 반도체 품귀가 발생하며 전 세계적인 차원으로 확산됐다. 

각국은 반도체 산업에 대한 지배력이 국가 안보와 경쟁력과 직결된다는 것을 깨닫고, 공급망이 끊겨 문제가 생기지 않도록 반도체 내수화와 핵심 소재 공급망 다변화, 기업간 M&A를 추진하며 국가적 차원의 공격적인 조치와 투자를 단행하고 있다.

훗날 ‘세계 제1차 반도체 대전’으로 기록될지도 모르는 치열한 반도체 패권 다툼 속에서 우리는 어떻게 대처하고 무엇을 준비해야 할까. 한국경제신문 황정수 기자가 현대산업의 중심 실리콘밸리에서 특파원으로 근무하며 취재한 내용을 바탕으로 집필한 이 책을 통해 우리는 반도체 산업에 대한 정확한 이해와 k-반도체의 나아갈 방향을 예측할 수 있을 것이다.

제목 그대로 김우석 작가가 지닌 투자에 관련된 모든 이야기를 모아 놓은 집성체와 같다. 선박금융 프로젝트 분석부터 개인적으로 시작했던 여러 가지 투자 방법과 실패담을 가감 없이 담았다. 또한, 선박의 종류와 그것의 특징을 자세하게 담아 투자 시 이점과 주의해야 할 사항을 파악할 수 있도록 했다.

이 책에는 실제로 그 당시 사람들이 어떻게 투자했고 얼마의 이익을 보았으며, 어떤 규모로 손실을 입었는지 설명하는 것에서 끝나지 않는다. 당시에 투자자가 이익을 보거나 손실을 입은 배경을 설명하고, 그때의 상황에서 어떻게 하면 더 큰 이익을 보았을지 혹은 손실을 피할 수 있었을지를 제시한다. 마치 공부를 잘하는 전교 1등의 오답 노트를 얻게 된 것이나 마찬가지다.

저자는 책에서 선택은 항상 본인의 몫이라는 것을 잊지 말라고 강조한다. 또한 의사결정자는 항상 정직하고 본인에게 엄격해야 한다는 것을 언급한다. 투자는 단 한 번의 기회로 커다란 이익을 볼 수 있는 일명 일확천금의 '로또'가 아니다. 철저하게 자신을 분석하고 커다란 세계의 경제를 냉철하게 판단해야만 비로소 조금씩 성공을 거둘 수 있다. 그러한 복잡한 시황 속에서 이른바 '투자 성공기'를 맞이하기 위해 고군분투한 저자의 스토리에 주목하기를 바란다.

『선형대수와 통계학으로 배우는 머신러닝 with 파이썬』의 장철원 저자가 선형대수 기초를 다잡고 싶은 독자를 위해 집필한 선형대수 책이다. 기초적인 행렬부터 고차원 텐서까지 선형대수를 구성하는 개념 및 이론을 소개하고 독자 스스로 자신의 분야에 응용할 수 있도록 도와준다. 또한, 선형대수 이론이 의미하는 바를 자세히 설명하고 선형대수 이론을 파이썬 코드로 직접 구현함으로써 내 손으로 선형대수 라이브러리를 직접 만드는 즐거움을 선사한다.

실습은 두 파트로 나뉜다. 파이썬 실습 파트에서는 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 순수 파이썬 코드로 선형대수 이론을 직접 구현해 봄으로써 선형대수 기본기를 탄탄하게 다진다. 넘파이 실습 파트에서는 파이썬에서 제공하는 넘파이 라이브러리를 활용해 선형대수 이론을 활용하는 방법을 다룬다.
