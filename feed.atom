        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study relational contracts among managers using unique data that tracks transfers of workers across teams in Indian ready-made garment factories. We focus on how relational contracts help managers cope with worker absenteeism shocks, which are frequent, often large, weakly correlated across teams, and which substantially reduce team productivity. Together these facts imply gains from sharing workers. We show that managers respond to shocks by lending and borrowing workers in a manner consistent with relational contracting, but many potentially beneficial transfers are unrealized. This is because managers’ primary relationships are with a very small subset of potential partners. A borrowing event study around main trading partners’ separations from the firm reinforces the importance of relationships. We show robustness to excluding worker moves least likely to reflect relational borrowing responses to idiosyncratic absenteeism shocks. Counterfactual simulations reveal large gains to reducing costs associated with forming and maintaining additional relationships among managers.]]></summary>

Using model-implied inflation forecasting rules to extract state variables from the inflation forecasts in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we provide evidence that policy regimes without commitment prevailed before 1980 and regimes with commitment prevailed afterward. With theory and quantification, we find that evolution of reputational capital is central to understanding the behavior of inflation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Youth employment has been near historic lows in recent years, and racial gaps persist. This paper tests whether information frictions limit young people's labor market success with a field experiment involving over 43,000 youth in New York City. We build software that allows employers to quickly and easily produce letters of recommendation for randomly selected youth who worked under their supervision during a summer youth employment program. We then send these letters to nearly 9,000 youth over two years. Being sent a letter generates a 3 percentage point (4.5 percent) increase in employment the following year, with both employment and earnings increases persisting over the two-year follow-up period. By posting our own job advertisement, we document that while treatment youth do use the letters in applications, there is no evidence of other supply-side responses (i.e., no increased job search, motivation, or confidence); effects appear to be driven by the demand side. Labor market benefits accrue primarily to racial and ethnic minorities, suggesting frictions may contribute to racial employment gaps. But improved employment may also hamper on-time high school graduation. Additional evidence indicates that letters help improve job match quality. Results suggest that expanding the availability credible signals about young workers—particularly for those not on the margin of graduating high school—could improve the efficiency of the youth labor market.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The attractive properties of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm rest on the assumption of perfect information. Yet field studies of school matching show that information is imperfect, particularly for disadvantaged students. We model costly strategic learning when schools are ex ante symmetric, agree on their ranking of students, and learning is rationally inattentive. Our analytic solution quantifies how each student’s rank, learning costs and prior beliefs interact to determine their gross and net welfare as well as the extent and form of mistakes they make. In line with the evidence, we find that lower-ranked students are affected disproportionately more by information costs, generally suffering a larger welfare loss than higher-ranked students. Interactions between mechanism design, inattention and inequity are thus of first order importance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Job seekers often face substantial information frictions related to potential job quality. This is especially true in international labor markets, where intermediaries match prospective migrants with employers abroad. We conducted a randomized trial in Indonesia to explore how information about intermediary quality shapes migration choices and outcomes. Information reduces the migration rate, lowering use of low-quality intermediaries. However, workers who migrate receive better pre-departure preparation and have higher-quality job experiences abroad, despite no change in occupation or destination. Information does not change intentions to migrate or beliefs about the return to migration or intermediary quality. Nor does selection explain the improved outcomes for workers who choose to migrate with the information. Together, our findings are consistent with an increase in the option value of search: with better ability to differentiate offer quality, workers become choosier and ultimately have better migration experiences. This offers a new perspective on the importance of information and matching frictions in global labor markets.]]></summary>

To explore this question, I first describe the definitional and classification issues associated with digital trade, and for modeling purposes I adopt a simple taxonomy of the ways in which digital trade can arise and the policies that can be used to restrict such trade. I then review what the theoretical literature on the economics of trade agreements has to say about the purpose of a trade agreement in a pre-digital model world economy, and how this purpose can be seen to be reflected in the broad design features of both GATT and GATS, the WTO agreements that govern international trade in goods and services respectively. Finally, I introduce digital trade into the model world economy and revisit the purpose of a trade agreement. From this perspective I consider whether the rise of digital trade warrants changes in the design of the WTO.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We draw upon newly merged administrative data sets to study the relationship between payments from medical technology firms to physicians and medical device procurement by hospitals. These payments (and the interactions that accompany them) may facilitate the transfer of valuable information to and from physicians. However, they may also influence physicians’ treatment decisions, and in turn hospital device procurement, in favor of paying firms. Payments are pervasive: 87 percent of device sales in our sample occurred at a hospital where a relevant physician received a payment from a device firm. Payments are also highly correlated with spending within a firm-hospital pair: event studies suggest that a large positive increase in payments to a given hospital from a given firm ($438 per physician on average, or 112 percent of the mean) is associated with 27 percent higher expenditures on the paying firm’s devices post-event. Finally, we explore how payments mediate the relationship between expertise and device procurement patterns. Hospitals affiliated with the top Academic Medical Centers (AMCs), which plausibly represent an expert benchmark, purchase a different mix of devices than other hospitals, and payments to hospitals outside the top AMCs are correlated with larger deviations from the procurement patterns of top AMC hospitals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Women may under-report intimate partner violence (IPV) in surveys due to a variety of social and psychological factors. To understand if anonymized interviewing can allay this concern, we conduct a measurement experiment in rural Liberia and Malawi in which women were asked IPV questions via either self-interviewing (SI) or face-to-face interviewing (FTFI) with an enumerator. We find that about a third of women incorrectly answer basic screening questions over SI, and that it generates placebo effects on innocuous questions even for those who "pass" screening. Because the probability of responding "yes" to any specific IPV question is less than 50%, and that IPV is typically reported as an index (reporting yes to at least one question in a category of violence), such misunderstanding will tend to increase IPV reporting. In Malawi, we find that SI dramatically increases reported IPV, with the incidence of any type of IPV increasing by 13 percentage points on a base of 20%; in Liberia, we find an insignificant and modest increase of 4 percentage points on a base of 39%. Our results suggest SI may spuriously increase reported IPV rates.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A growing literature identifies associations between subjective and biometric indicators of wellbeing.  These associations, together with the ability of subjective wellbeing (SWB) metrics to predict health and behavioral outcomes, have spawned increasing interest in SWB as an important concept in its own right.  However, some social scientists continue to question the usefulness of SWB metrics.  We contribute to this literature in three ways.  First, we introduce a biometric measure of wellbeing – pulse – which has been largely overlooked.  Using nationally representative data on 165,000 individuals from the Health Survey for England (HSE) and Scottish Health Surveys (SHeS) we show that its correlates are similar in a number of ways to those for SWB, and that it is highly correlated with SWB metrics, as well as self-assessed health.  Second, we examine the determinants of pulse rates in mid-life (age 42) among the 9,000 members of the National Child Development Study (NCDS), a birth cohort born in a single week in 1958 in Britain.  Third, we track the impact of pulse measured in mid-life (age 42) on health and labor market outcomes at age 50 in 2008 and age 55 in 2013.  The probability of working at age 55 is negatively impacted by pulse rate a decade earlier.  The pulse rate has an impact over and above chronic pain measured at age 42.  General health at 55 is lower the higher the pulse rate at age 42, while those with higher pulse rates at 42 also express lower life satisfaction and more pessimism about the future at age 50.  Taken together, these results suggest social scientists can learn a great deal by adding pulse rates to the metrics they use when evaluating people’s wellbeing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AT&T was the largest U.S. firm for most of the 20th century. Telephone operators once comprised over 50% of its workforce, but in the late 1910s it initiated a decades-long process of automating telephone operation with mechanical call switching—a technology first invented in the 1880s. We study what drove AT&T to do so, and why it took one firm nearly a century to automate this one basic function. Interdependencies between operators and nearly every other part of the business were obstacles: the manual switchboard was the fulcrum of a complex system which had developed around it, and automation only began after the firm and automatic technology were adapted to work together. Even then, automatic switching was only profitable for AT&T in larger markets—hence diffusion expanded as costs declined and service areas grew. We show that automation supported AT&T's continued growth, generating a positive feedback loop between scale and automation that reinforced AT&T's high market share in local markets.]]></summary>

We study unrestricted tax systems on income and savings (or other commodities) that implement the optimal direct-revelation mechanism, as well as simpler tax systems that impose common restrictions like separability between earnings and savings taxes. We characterize the optimum using familiar elasticity concepts and a sufficient statistic for across-income preference heterogeneity: the difference between the cross-sectional variation of savings with income, and the causal effect of income on savings. The Atkinson-Stiglitz Theorem is a knife-edge case corresponding to zero difference, and a number of other key results in optimal tax theory are subsumed as special cases. Our formulas also apply to other sources of across-income heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in rates of return on savings, inheritances, and the ability to shift income between tax bases. We provide tractable extensions of these results that include multidimensional heterogeneity, additional efficiency rationales for taxing heterogeneous returns, and corrective motives to encourage more saving. Applying these formulas in a calibrated model of the U.S. economy, we find that the optimal savings tax is positive and progressive.]]></summary>

These two programs were set to expire in September 2021, but 18 states opted out of both in June 2021. Using Current Population Survey data, we present difference-in-difference and event study estimates that the flow of unemployed workers into employment increased by around two-thirds following early termination. We construct a counterfactual scenario that implies the national unemployment rate in each of July and August would have been around 0.3 percentage point lower than they were, and the employment-population ratio would have been around 0.1-0.2 percentage point higher than it was, had all states ended FPUC and PUA in June. Expanded eligibility and generosity of UI may have both slowed transitions from unemployment to employment. We also present some suggestive evidence that households with relatively high confidence in their ability to meet expenses may have been less sensitive to the termination of expanded benefits. Finally, we present evidence that early termination reduced the share of households that had no difficulty meeting expenses by five percent. The welfare implications of the early termination of FPUC and PUA are therefore ambiguous.]]></summary>

Concerns about premature deindustrialization have made some observers skeptical about the potential for manufacturing to play this role in Africa. But employment in African manufacturing has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. These employment gains have been accompanied by: (i) large increases in the number of small manufacturing firms; (ii) limited employment gains in large firms; and (iii) robust labor productivity growth in Africa’s large firms. Limited employment growth in Africa’s large manufacturing firms is partly a result of the capital intensity of the manufacturing sub-sectors in which African countries are most engaged – the processing of resources, and partly a result of rising capital intensity in manufacturing. The potential for manufacturing to raise living standards in Africa depends on indirect job creation by large firms through backward and forward linkages and increasing labor productivity in small firms.]]></summary>

We find that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a limited negative effect on output but a persistent negative impact on prices. In contrast to alternative identification approaches, we do not observe a price puzzle when analyzing the period from 1987 to 2008. Further, we validate the identification approach in a simple New Keynesian model, augmented by the assumption that the central bank observes the ingredients of the Taylor rule with error.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many African countries are still in the early stages of structural transformation. Typically, as economies move through the structural transformation, activities once conducted within the household are outsourced to the market. This has particular implications for women’s time use. In this paper, we document that current patterns of female time use in home production in several African countries closely resemble historical time use patterns in the US. We highlight two stylized facts about women’s time use in Africa. First, in North Africa, women spend very few hours in market work and female labor force participation overall is extremely low. Second, although extensive margin participation of women is high in sub-Saharan Africa, women tend to work in the market for only a few hours each week, with the rest of their work hours spent in home production. These two facts suggest two types of constraints that could slow down the reallocation of female time from home to market as economies grow: Social norms related to women’s market work, and a lack of infrastructure (e.g. household infrastructure and childcare facilities) to facilitate marketizing home production. We discuss recent empirical evidence related to each set of constraints and highlight new avenues for research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper revisits Peltzman (1973) in light of two recent opportunities to quantitatively assess tradeoffs in drug regulation.  First, reduced regulatory barriers to drug manufacturing associated with the 2017 reauthorization of Generic Drug User Fee Amendments were followed by significantly more entry and lower consumer prices for prescription drugs.  Using a simple and versatile industry model and historical data on entry, I find that easing generic restrictions discourages innovation, but this welfare cost is more than offset by consumer benefits from enhanced competition, especially after 2016.  Second, accelerated vaccine approval in 2020 had unprecedented net benefits as it not only improved health but substantially changed the trajectory of the wider economy.  The evidence suggests that cost-benefit analysis of FDA regulation is incomplete without accounting for substitution toward potentially unsafe and ineffective treatments that are both outside FDA jurisdiction and heavily utilized prior to FDA approval.  Moreover, the policy processes initiating these 21st century regulatory changes show a clear influence of Peltzman’s 1973 findings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital credit has expanded rapidly in Africa, mostly in the form of short-term, high-interest loans offered via mobile money. Loan terms are often opaque and consumer financial literacy is low, providing opportunities for predatory lending. A regression discontinuity analysis shows no negative effect of access to digital loans on financial well-being, but the majority of borrowers fail to repay on time and incur high late fees. We randomize exposure to a short phone-based financial literacy intervention. The intervention improved knowledge and marginally improved loan repayment but increased loan demand, increasing overall default risk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the relevance of cognitive uncertainty – subjective uncertainty over one's utility-maximizing action – for understanding and predicting intertemporal choice. The main idea is that when people are cognitively noisy, such as when a decision is complex, they implicitly treat different time delays to some degree alike. By experimentally measuring and manipulating cognitive uncertainty, we document  three economic implications of this idea. First,  cognitive uncertainty explains various core empirical regularities, such as why people often appear very impatient, why per-period impatience is smaller over long than over short horizons, why discounting is often hyperbolic even when the present is not involved, and why choices frequently violate transitivity. Second, impatience is context-dependent: discounting is substantially more hyperbolic when the decision environment is more complex. Third, cognitive uncertainty matters for choice architecture: people who are nervous about making mistakes are twice as likely to follow expert advice to be more patient.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes: The expansion to the Panama Canal was completed in 2016 (As I noted a few years ago), and some of the traffic that used the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is probably going through the canal. This might be impacting TEUs on the West Coast.
Also, incoming port traffic is backed up significantly in the LA area with numerous ships at anchor waiting to unload.
Container traffic gives us an idea about the volume of goods being exported and imported - and usually some hints about the trade report since LA area ports handle about 40% of the nation's container port traffic.
The following graphs are for inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs (TEUs: 20-foot equivalent units or 20-foot-long cargo container). 
To remove the strong seasonal component for inbound traffic, the first graph shows the rolling 12-month average. 
Click on graph for larger image.
On a rolling 12-month basis, inbound traffic was down 0.8% in November compared to the rolling 12 months ending in October.   Outbound traffic was down 2.0% compared to the rolling 12 months ending the previous month.
The 2nd graph is the monthly data (with a strong seasonal pattern for imports).
Usually imports peak in the July to October period as retailers import goods for the Christmas holiday, and then decline sharply and bottom in February or March depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

2021 started off incredibly strong for imports - and with the backlog of ships, will likely stay strong into 2022 (no break again in February or March).


It is disappointing that traffic dipped in November compared to the previous months so there are quite a few ships still waiting to unload.

Imports were down 10% YoY in November, and exports were down 22% YoY.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
An interesting question: Is how many of these units under construction are due to supply chain constraints. Census will release data next year on the length of time from start to completion, and that will probably show long delays in 2021. In 2020, it took an average of 6.8 months from start to completion for single family homes, and 15.4 months for buildings with 2 or more units.
For single family homes, starts have been at about the same level for over a year, so - in normal times - we’d expect completions to be at about the same level as starts. With some simple calculations, it seems that supply chain issues have delayed the completion of somewhere between 70,000 and 150,000 single family homes that would have normally been completed by November.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: This is as of November 30th.
From the MBA: MBA Loan Monitoring Survey: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Decreases to 1.67%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) new monthly Loan Monitoring Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 39 basis points from 2.06% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior month to 1.67% as of November 30,  2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 835,000 homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 16 basis points to 0.76%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 42 basis points to 2.10%, and the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) declined 106 basis points to 3.94%.
“The share of loans in forbearance in November declined – albeit at a slower pace than October – as  borrowers continued to near the expiration of their forbearance plans and moved into permanent loan  workout solutions,” said Marina Walsh, CMB, MBA’s Vice President of Industry Analysis.
Total loans serviced that were current (not delinquent or in foreclosure) as a percent of servicing  portfolio volume (#) rose to 94.58% in November from 94.32% in October (on a non-seasonally adjusted  basis). Total completed loan workouts from 2020 and onward (repayment plans, loan deferrals/partial  claims, loan modifications) that were current as a percent of total completed workouts declined to  83.69% last month from 84.04% in October.

Inventory usually declines sharply over the holidays - so we will likely see new record lows in the next few weeks.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of December 17th, inventory was at 326 thousand (7-day average), compared to 454 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 28.2%.  Inventory is down 3.9% from last week.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 59.5% from 804 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 339 thousand, and was down 27.7% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory last week was about 6.3% above the record low set-in early April.


Inventory peaked for the year in early September, when inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year), so inventory is currently off about 25.5% from the peak for the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.45 million in November, up 1,7% from October’s preliminary pace but down 2.1% from last November’s seasonally adjusted pace.  Unadjusted sales should be little changed from a year earlier, with the SA/NSA difference reflecting this November’s higher business day count relative to last November’s.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that the YOY % decline in the inventory of existing homes for sale last month was larger than was the case in October.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 13.0% from last November. 
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release November existing home sales on Wednesday, December 22, 2021, at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 6.20 million SAAR.   Take the over.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
This update adds Austin, California, Des Moines, Memphis, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Sacramento.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 15.3% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 26.7% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 23.4% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

December 5-11, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 57.4% (-4.8%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $128.35 (+2.3%)

Excerpt: 
The fourth graph shows housing starts under construction, Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
Red is single family units. Currently there are 752 thousand single family units under construction (SA). This is the highest level since March 2007.
For single family, most of these homes are already sold (Census counts sales when contract is signed). The reason there are so many homes is probably due to construction delays. Since most of these are already sold, it is unlikely this is “overbuilding”, or that this will impact prices.
Blue is for 2+ units. Currently there are 734 thousand multi-family units under construction.  This is the highest level since July 1974! For multi-family, construction delays are probably also a factor. The completion of these units should help with rent pressure.
Census will release data next year on the length of time from start to completion, and that will probably show long delays in 2021.  In 2020, it took an average of 6.8 months from start to completion for single family homes, and 15.4 months for buildings with 2 or more units.
Combined, there are 1.486 million units under construction. This is the most since 1973.

This graph shows Capacity Utilization. This series is up from the record low set in April 2020, and above the level in February 2020 (pre-pandemic).
Capacity utilization at 76.8% is 2.8% below the average from 1972 to 2020.  This was at consensus expectations.
Note: y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the change.

The second graph shows industrial production since 1967.
Industrial production increased in November to 102.3.  This is above the February 2020 level.

Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in November were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,679,000.  This is 11.8 percent above the revised October estimate of 1,502,000 and is 8.3 percent above the November 2020 rate of 1,551,000.  Single‐family housing starts in November were at a rate of 1,173,000; this is 11.3 percent above the revised October figure of 1,054,000. The November rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 491,000.
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in November were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,712,000.  This is 3.6 percent above the revised October rate of 1,653,000 and is 0.9 percent above the November 2020 rate of 1,696,000.  Single‐family authorizations in November were at a rate of 1,103,000; this is 2.7 percent above the revised October figure of 1,074,000.

The first graph shows single and multi-family housing starts for the last several years.
Multi-family starts (blue, 2+ units) increased in November compared to October.   Multi-family starts were up 37% year-over-year in November.
Single-family starts (red) increased in November, and were down 0.7% year-over-year.
The second graph shows single and multi-family housing starts since 1968. 
This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and then the eventual recovery (but still not historically high).
Total housing starts in November were above expectations, and starts in September and October were up slightly revised, combined.

Wall Street forecasts are for GDP to increase at close to a 6.5% annual rate in Q4 that would put Q4-over-Q4 at around 5.4% - so the FOMC projections for 2021 were revised down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: The Household Mystery
Excerpt: 
Using the Census Bureau data, we can calculate the impact the number of households needed in the 1970s due to 1) population growth, and 2) changes in household size:
Over those 12 years, the US needed an additional 950 thousand housing units per year due to the changes in household size.  However, the US only needed about 550 thousand housing units per year due to population growth.  Because of the changes in household size, the U.S. needed far more additional housing units in the '70s than in recent years with the number of persons per household relatively stable.
Notes for all tables:
Over the last two years - in 2020 and 2021 - the US needed very few new housing units due to population growth, so the demand for homeownership and rentals must be coming mostly from smaller household size. (NOTE: There was also significant 2nd home buying and other reasons).
Is something similar happening now to household size with the millennials?    It probably is, and unfortunately household data is not timely or reliable.]]></summary>

유영성 외 지음, 경기연구원 엮음 / 다할미디어 / 2021년 12월 / ISBN:9791191656152

기본소득은 과연 가능할까. 인공지능과 로봇이 인간의 노동력을 대체할 미래에는 기본소득으로 불평등과 빈곤문제를 해결할 것으로 전망하는 실정이다. 제도의 취지나 당위로는 더할 나위가 없다. 관건은 재원 마련이다. 막대한 돈이 드는 기본소득을 현실로 옮길 수 있을까. 이 책 『모두의 기본소득, 재원을 마련하다』의 저자들은 “기본소득 지급도, 재원조달도 모두 가능하다”고 입을 모은다.

기본소득 재원 마련의 철학적 기초는 ‘공유부’에 있다. 토지, 환경, 지식, 데이터 등 모두에게 속한 공유부의 수익을 평등하게 나눈다는 것이다. 이 책은 기본소득으로 지급할 수 있는 재원으로서, 공유부에 근거해 정당성을 획득한 모든 방안을 다룬다.

기본소득 금액을 먼저 정하고 이에 부합하는 재정모델을 설정한 다음 지급 방안을 마련하는 접근과는 다르다. 조달 가능한 재원을 최대한으로 모색하고 그 규모를 추계해 제시하는 방식이다. 실현가능한 재원조달 방안들과 조달액 추계 범위 내에서 상황에 따라 단계별로 취할 수 있는 조합을 모색하는 데 도움이 된다.

현재 뜨겁게 논쟁이 일고 있는 메타버스에 대한 전반적인 이해를 넘어서 산업 생태계, 관리, 경제학, 기반시설 등 여러 각도에서 생각해 봐야 할 관점을 보여 준다. 저자들은 과거 디지털 경제를 연구하면서 깨달은 바에 과학 기술 분야의 가장 놀랄 만한 변혁을 결합해 향후 발전 방향의 윤곽을 정리했다.

문제는 인류가 앞으로 살아갈 이 디지털 신세계에서는 과거 전통 경제에서 당연하다고 여겨졌던 기본 원칙들이 모두 통하지 않는다는 것이다. 더구나 이 책의 서문을 쓴 이더리움의 창시자 비탈릭 부테린은 메타버스의 디지털 자산 규모가 머지않아 현실 세계의 자산 규모를 넘어설 것이라고 예언한다.

메타버스는 단순한 경제가 아니라 ‘사회’이며 더욱이 M세대(메타버스 세대)가 만든 포스트모던 사회다. 메타버스에는 경제 현상은 물론이고 문화 현상과 사회 현상도 있다. 국가, 민족, 지역, 시간의 경계를 초월한 이 사회는 어떤 문명을 만들어낼까? 이 책은 도래할 메타버스 시대를 준비하고 기회를 포착하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

20세기 가장 위대한 경제학자, 케인스. 그는 경제 이론과 경제 정책에 있어 위대한 지적 혁명을 촉발시켰다. 이 책은 수학 방정식 등을 최소화하면서, 대학교 학부학생, 열린 마음을 가지고 있는 기존 강단 경제학자, 공무원 그리고 일반 경제인 등 다양한 계층의 독자 모두가 쉽게 케인스의 경제 사상을 이해할 수 있도록 설명하고 있다.

이 책은 케인스 이론의 핵심적인 개념들, 즉 시장경제에 있어서 불확실성, 균형의 의미, 화폐의 역할, 그리고 유효수요의 원칙을 설명함으로써, 이러한 핵심 개념을 철저히 무시하고 있는 기존 주류 경제학과 그 안에서의 자칭 케인지언들이 가지는 오류를 지적하고 있다.

또한 그에 비추어 현대 경제에 있어서 다양한 논쟁점들, 즉 고용과 실업의 문제, 재정과 금융 정책, 국제수지 문제 등에 대한 케인스적인 해결 방안을 시사하고 있다. 특히 그러한 논의들을 역사적 배경(베르사유조약부터 브레턴우즈 체제까지)과 연결시키고, 또한 케인스의 경제 이론이 현재의 유로존 문제에 어떤 해결점을 제시할 수 있는지도 검토한다.

지금 우리가 처한 세계를 이해하는 가장 적합한 키워드가 있다면 그것은 ‘불평등’이다. 토마 피케티는 지난 몇십 년 동안 전 세계적으로 소득과 부의 불평등이 증가했다고 말한다. 그의 책 『21세기 자본』이 촉발한 불평등이라는 주제는 경제뿐 아니라 정치, 사회적으로 경각심을 일으키고 커다란 영향을 끼쳤다. 

경제학자 이정우는 피케티의 첫 책과 함께 최근작 『자본과 이데올로기』와 여러 저명한 경제학자가 함께 쓴 『세계불평등보고서 2018』을 통해 피케티가 정확히 어떤 진단을 내리고 있는지 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 불평등 문제를 해소하기 위해 피케티가 제시한 사회국가, 누진소득세, 세계자본세 그리고 참여사회주의와 참여연방주의 등의 처방에 대해서도 살펴본다. 

저자가 피케티의 책을 안내하는 이유는 한국 사회의 불평등을 바로 보고, 그에 따른 대안을 제안하고자 하는 데 있다. 한국은 소득 불평등, 정규직과 비정규직의 양극화, 부동산으로 인한 자산 불평등이 유독 심각하다. 저자는 이 문제의 해결 없이는 한국 경제의 지속적인 발전과 선진국 진입은 어렵다고 말한다. 나아가 한국이 처한 현실을 냉정하게 드러내 보여주고, 더 나은 세상으로 바꿔나가기 위한 다양한 해법들을 제시하고 있다.

책을 펴내며 

1. 피케티 신드롬! 돈이 돈을 번다 
2. 대공황, 뉴딜 그리고 황금시대 
3. 피케티의 불평등 처방 
4. 피케티에 반기를 들다 
5. 세계는 얼마나 불평등한가 
6. 불평등은 정당한가 
7. 불평등은 정치적이다 
8. 세습자본주의에 대한 저항 
9. 한국의 불평등은 더 심해질까? 
10. 한국 사회와 부동산 불평등 

<보론> 실력주의와 불평등

TensorFlow와 sklearn을 사용해 금융이나 경제 맥락에 인공지능을 접목하는 방법론을 설명한다. 먼저 경제학이 추구하는 지향점과 머신러닝의 특징과 장점을 비교해 같은 점과 다른 점을 분석한 다음 양 측면에서 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 방대한 참고문헌과 함께 설명한다. 기초적인 회귀에서 출발해 결정 트리와 랜덤 포레스트를 살펴보고 이미지 처리와 자연어 처리가 금융 맥락에서 어떻게 활발하게 활용되고 있는지 설명한다. 특히 자연어 처리 부분이 금융 맥락과 접목되는 지점은 다양한 실습과 예제를 통해 손쉽게 이해하도록 돕는다.

금융 데이터의 특징인 시계열 데이터는 RNN과 LSTM를 활용해 설명한다. 또한 생성적 모델을 적용하는 방법과 이론적 모델 부분도 다룬다. 각 장은 모두 예제와 코드를 지원하며 이를 통해 각 상황을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 기초를 제공한다. 책에서 제공하는 방대한 참고문헌은 금융 맥락에서 인공지능을 접목하려던 수많은 학자의 발자취를 살펴볼 귀중한 자료다.

“수신료의 가치를 증명한 명품 다큐” 등 시청자들의 뜨거운 호평을 받은 2021년 화제의 다큐멘터리 〈팬데믹 머니〉가 책으로 만들어졌다. 2차 세계대전 이후 최악의 실물경제와 최대 호황을 맞이한 자산 시장이 교차하는 이 모순된 현실은 왜 발생하는 걸까? 

그 답을 구하기 위해 〈팬데믹 머니〉 제작진은 제러미 리프킨, 제이슨 솅커, 오건영, 박종훈 등 국내외 최고 경제 전문가들을 만나 달러라는 기축통화가 작동하는 방식부터 어마어마하게 풀린 돈이 거품과 부채를 만들고 결국 경제 위기를 불러일으키는 과정을 깊이 있게 추적한다.

특히 『팬데믹 머니: 감염된 경제, 풀린 돈의 역습에 대비하라』는 방송에서 미처 다 보여주지 못한 전문가들과의 대담을 수록했다. 또한 2022년 달라질 경제 환경과 자산 시장에 대해 통화정책 전문가 김진일 고려대 교수와 금융 전문가 오건영 신한은행 부부장과 이야기를 나눴다.

금리와 환율만 알면 경제 공부 다했다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 금리와 환율에는 국내외 경제 상황이 총체적으로 반영되어 있기 때문이다. 금리와 환율이 주가에 미치는 영향이나 상관관계에 따른 책은 많으나, 금리와 환율에만 초점을 맞추며 경제를 풀어내는 책은 찾기 어렵다. 그래서 ‘거시경제의 거장’이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 『금리와 환율 알고 갑시다』를 통해 어렵고 복잡한 경제이론과 시장의 상황을 낱낱이 분석하여 자신만의 철학으로 쉽게 명쾌하게 풀어낸다. 

지금 우리에게 필요한 것은 단순 금리와 환율의 개념이 아니다. 금리와 환율을 통해 현재의 경제 상황을 이해하고, 미래를 내다볼 수 있는 통찰력을 갖추어 조금 더 명확하게 경제의 흐름을 파악하는 안목이다. 그 깊이 있는 안목은 금리 인상(하락), 환율 변동, 집값 상승(하락) 등의 위기에도 올바른 판단과 실행을 이룰 수 있게 도와줄 것이다.

프롤로그: 금리와 환율 알고 갑시다

제1부 금리 알고 갑시다
금리란 무엇일까요?
• 금리의 기원은 신용에 있습니다
• 경제학 교과서에서는 현재의 소비를 참는 데에 대한 대가를 금리라 합니다
한국은행의 통화정책 수단, 기준금리
• 한국은행의 기준금리는 모든 금리의 기준입니다
• 기준금리는 한국은행 금융통화위원회에서 결정합니다

지난 2,000년 사이에 지구의 온도는 1도 정도를 오르내리는 선에서 안정적으로 유지되었다. 덕분에 인류는 살아남아 번영을 구가했고 전 세계 인구는 70억까지 늘어났다. 그러나 지금의 세계는 지구온난화로 인한 기상이변으로 돌이킬 수 없는 타격을 입고 있다. 경제적 측면에서도 위기의 상황에 접어들었다. 

이에 저자는 지금 당장 국가, 기업이 탄소 중심의 경제 체제에서 벗어나 재생에너지, 전기자동차 등 저탄소 경제 체제로 변화하지 않으면 미래는 없다고 단언하고 이미 기후위기를 기회로 만드는 국가와 기업들의 사례를 통해 우리에게 나아가야 할 방향을 제시한다.

정가: 17,000원 / 판매가: 15,300원 / 마일리지: 72원

회복과 재생을 촉진하는 새로운 미래 자본주의 모델 안내서 《그린 스완》이 출간됐다. 그린 스완은 지난 2007년 뉴욕대학교 교수 나심 니콜라스 탈레브가 제시한 용어 ‘블랙 스완’에서 파생했다. 블랙 스완은 가능성이 극히 적지만, 일단 발생하면 돌이킬 수 없을 정도의 엄청난 충격을 주는 사건을 말한다. 9.11 테러나 2008년 세계 금융위기가 그 대표적인 예다. 그린 스완은 ‘해결책’을 더한, ‘자본시장의 변화를 촉진하는 개념’으로 지속가능성 측면에서 새롭게 정의한 미래 자본주의 모델이라고 할 수 있다. 

이 책은 이미 시작된 ‘변화의 징후’를 읽는 10가지 용어인 목적, 비즈니스 모델, 수익, 성장, 가치, 임팩트, 책임, 중대성, 지배구조, 좌초자산을 통해 세계 경제의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있음을 확인한다. 기업에서 전례가 없는 엄청난 사안에 직면하게 될 때, 종종 ‘사악한 문제’가 발생한다. 예를 들면 담배 회사는 흡연이 수많은 질병을 일으킨다는 것을 알면서도 그 문제를 은폐해왔고, 결국 거대한 액수의 벌금을 선고받아야 했다.

저자가 지적하는 사악한 문제는 크게 다섯 가지다. 플라스틱 쓰레기로 오염된 바다, 살인자 칼로리, 항생제가 초래한 슈퍼버그, 탄소가 급격히 기온을 상승시킨 것, 심각하게 증가한 우주 쓰레기다. 책에서는 이를 해결하기 위한 다섯 가지 패러다임을 짚어내고, 그린 스완의 특성을 지닌 자본주의와 민주주의 그리고 지속가능성을 제시한다. 저자는 세계 기업들에 다음과 같이 엄중하게 윤리성을 촉구한다.

‘공정한 보상’의 저자 신재용 교수는 ‘MZ세대에게 ‘공정’이란 노력에 대한 정당한 대가를 의미하는 매우 실용적인 개념’이라고 말한다. 부도 신분도 대물림되는, 별다른 출구가 없는 이 세대가 살아남기 위해 강조하는 레토릭(rhetoric)이 바로 ‘공정’인 것이다. 

MZ세대는 ‘교환(exchange)’이라는 틀로 세상을 본다. 신재용 교수는 이 책에서 화이트칼라 MZ세대의 특수한 성장배경을 분석하며, 학창시절부터 통과의례처럼 거듭한 토너먼트 경쟁 끝에 현재의 직장에 자리한 이들에게 ‘투입한 노력에 상응하는 대가’를 받는 공정한 교환관계를 유지하는 것이야말로 자신을 지키는 일임을 밝힌다.

MZ세대의 보상에 대한 요구를 이해하고 제도를 정렬하라
집단을 넘어 개인의 성과로: 역량 있는 관리자의 육성부터 시작하자
평가/보상의 투명성이 중요하다
직급 중심에서 역할 중심으로, 획일적인 보상에서 다양한 보상으로
성장할 수 있는 기회도 보상의 일부다

협동조합기본법 시행 10년, ‘협동조합 2만 개 시대’를 맞아 지나온 역사와 현실 상황을 살피고, 한국의 협동조합은 무엇을 해야 할지 모색하며 새로운 대안으로 ‘협동조합 허브론’을 제시한다.

협동조합 운동의 본질은 협동하려는 인간에 대한 신뢰를 바탕으로 자유롭고 평등한 사회를 만들겠다는 인류의 꿈을 실현하는 것이다. 그러나 갈수록 심해지는 불평등과 인류의 존재 자체를 위협하는 기후 위기 앞에서 그 꿈은 닿을 수 없는 이상에 불과한 것 아닌가 하는 회의의 정서가 짙다. 

책은 그런 참혹한 현실을 직시하면서, 그럼에도 불구하고 협동조합만이 할 수 있는 영역이 분명히 있음을 확인한다. 그것은 협동조합이 작은 협동의 경험들을 이어 큰 협동으로 나아가는 접착제 역할을 하고 사회 곳곳을 협동으로 연결하는 허브가 되는 것이다.

김기태, 강민수 두 저자는 한국 협동조합 운동의 산증인으로, 현장은 물론 협동조합 연구 분야에서도 혁혁한 성과를 보여 주었다. 이제 협동조합 허브론이라는 새로운 운동론을 제안하며 40년 전 레이들로가 ICA(국제협동조합연맹) 모스크바 대회에서 제기한 협동조합의 정체성에서 한 걸음 더 나아갈 것을 촉구한다.

북한과 인접한 해안가에는 파도에 떠밀려 온 북한 생활 쓰레기가 가득하다. 이 지역에서 수거한 북한 생활 쓰레기 제품 포장지는 모두 708종의 1,414점이다. 당과류와 음료류는 물론 식품류와 잡화류 그리고 의약품까지 실로 그 종류가 엄청나다. 

자력갱생을 강조하는 북한에서 어떻게 이리도 다양한 상품을 만들어 내는지 그저 의아할 뿐이었다. 그렇게 하나둘 모은 생활 쓰레기는 북한 사회를 읽는 소중한 자료이자 보물이 되었다. 생활쓰레기 포장지는 북한 제품의 브랜드와 디자인, 생산공장 현황 그리고 정치선전을 엿볼 수 있다. 북한사람들의 흔적이 고스란히 담긴 서해안의 <평양마켓>으로 함께 떠나보자.

파이썬을 마스터할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 연습이다. 숫자 맞히기 게임, 16진수 출력하기와 같은 간단한 문제부터 판매세 계산하기, 순환하는 이터레이터 만들기와 같은 궁금한 문제들까지 프로그래밍 실력을 키워 줄 엄선된 50가지 연습 문제를 담았다. 

먼저 어떤 내용을 다룰지 알아보고, 문제를 제시한 후, 해답과 함께 풀어보며, 어떻게 동작하는지 그리고 추가로 어떤 부분을 고민해볼지도 설명한다. 새로운 문제에 도전할 때마다 프로그래밍 기술과 자신감을 키울 수 있을 것이다. 또한, 이렇게 배운 내용들은 자신의 프로젝트에 적용해볼 수도 있다. 파이썬을 배운 후 어떻게 실력을 키울지 막막하다면 이 책으로 시작해보자.
