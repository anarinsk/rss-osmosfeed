        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. population is aging. We examine whether immigration causally affects the likelihood that the U.S.-born elderly live in institutional settings. Using a shift-share instrument to identify exogenous variation in immigration, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the less-educated foreign-born labor force share in a local area reduces institutionalization among the elderly by 1.5 and 3.8 percentage points for those aged 65+ and 80+, a 26-29 percent effect relative to the mean. The estimates imply that a typical U.S-born individual over age 65 in the year 2000 was 0.5 percentage points (10 percent) less likely to be living in an institution than would have been the case if immigration had remained at 1980 levels. We show that immigration affects the availability and cost of home services, including those provided by home health aides, gardeners and housekeepers, and other less-educated workers, reducing the cost of aging in the community.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the large costs of infectious diseases, less attention has been paid to the impacts of more common, endemic respiratory viruses that frequently circulate in the population, especially when it comes to their potential long-term consequences for population health, human capital, and economic outcomes. This paper uses Danish population-level administrative data on 35 birth cohorts of children to provide a comprehensive analysis of both the mechanisms through which infants become infected by respiratory illnesses, as well as the consequences of early-life respiratory disease exposure for their later outcomes. First, we document a striking difference in the likelihood of severe respiratory illness by birth order: younger siblings have two to three times higher rates of hospitalization for respiratory conditions before age one than older siblings at the same age. We argue that the family unit is central in virus transmission, with older children "bringing home" the virus to their younger siblings. We then combine the birth order variation with within-municipality variation in respiratory disease prevalence among preschool-aged children to identify differential long-term impacts of early-life respiratory illness between younger and older siblings. We find that moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the local disease prevalence distribution ("disease index") is associated with a 30.9 percent differential increase in the number of respiratory illness hospitalizations in the first year of life for younger compared to older siblings. In the long term, for younger relative to older siblings, we find a 0.5 percent differential reduction in the likelihood of high school graduation, and a 1.3 percent additional reduction in age-30 earnings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use textual analysis of earnings conference calls held by listed firms around the world to measure the amount of risk managers and investors at each firm associate with each country at each point in time. Flexibly aggregating this firm-country-quarter-level data allows us to systematically identify spikes in perceived country risk (“crises”) and document their source and pattern of transmission to foreign firms. While this pattern usually follows a gravity structure, it often changes dramatically during crises. For example, while crises originating in developed countries propagate disproportionately to foreign financial firms, emerging market crises transmit less financially and more to traditionally exposed countries. We apply our measures to show that (i) elevated perceptions of a country's riskiness, particularly those of foreign and financial firms, are associated with significant falls in local asset prices, capital outflows, and reductions in firm-level investment and employment. (ii) Risk transmitted from foreign countries affects the investment decisions of domestic firms.  (iii) Heterogeneous currency loadings on perceived global risk can help explain the cross-country pattern of interest rates and currency risk premia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the labor markets in China and the United States, the two largest economies in the world, by examining the evolution of their cross-sectional age-earnings profiles during the past thirty years. We find that, first, the peak age in the cross-sectional age-earnings profiles, which we refer to as the “golden age,” stayed almost constant at around 45-50 in the U.S., but decreased sharply from 55 to around 35 in China; second, the age-specific earnings grew drastically in China, but stayed almost stagnant in the U.S.; third, the cross-sectional and life-cycle age-earnings profiles were remarkably similar in the U.S., but differed substantially in China. We propose and empirically implement a decomposition framework to infer from the repeated cross-sectional earnings data the experience effect (i.e., human capital accumulation over the life cycle), the cohort effect (i.e., inter-cohort human capital growth), and the time effect (i.e., changes in the human capital rental prices over time), under an identifying assumption that the growth of the experience effect stops at the end of one's working career. The decomposition suggests that China has experienced a much larger inter-cohort productivity growth and higher increase in the rental price to human capital, but lower returns to experience, compared to the U.S. We also use the inferred components to revisit several important and classical applications in macroeconomics and labor economics, including growth accounting and the estimation of TFP growth, and the college wage premium and skill-biased technical change.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper summarizes the results of nearly a dozen new papers presented at the Sundance Conference on Monopsony in Labor Markets held in October 2018.  These papers, to be published as a special issue of the Journal of Human Resources, study various aspects of monopsony and failures of competition in labor markets. It also reports on the new developments in public policies associated with widespread concerns about labor market competition and efforts to ameliorate competitive failures. The conference papers range from studies of the labor supply elasticity individual firms face to studies of local labor market concentration to studies of explicit covenants suppressing labor market competition. New policies range from private and public antitrust litigation to concerns about the effect of mergers and inter-firm agreements on labor market competition. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanics of the Silicon Valley High Tech Worker conspiracy to suppress competition based on Court documents in the case. Non-compete agreements, which are not enforceable in three states already, have also come under scrutiny.]]></summary>

Using administrative loan application and performance data from the U.S. Federal Disaster Loan Program, we exploit a loan amount threshold above which households must post their residence as collateral. One-third of all borrowers select the maximum uncollateralized loan amount, and our bunching estimates suggest that the median borrower is willing to give up 40% of their loan amount to avoid collateral. Exploiting time variation in the loan amount threshold, we find that collateral causally reduces default rates by 35%. Our results help to explain high perceived default costs in the mortgage market, and uniquely quantify the extent to which collateral reduces moral hazard in consumer credit markets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is common to rank different categories by means of preferences that are revealed through data on choices. A prominent example is the ranking of political candidates or parties using the estimated share of support each one receives in surveys or polls about political attitudes. Since these rankings are computed using estimates of the share of support rather than the true share of support, there may be considerable uncertainty concerning the true ranking of the political candidates or parties. In this paper, we consider the problem of accounting for such uncertainty by constructing confidence sets for the rank of each category. We consider both the problem of constructing marginal confidence sets for the rank of a particular category as well as simultaneous confidence sets for the ranks of all categories. A distinguishing feature of our analysis is that we exploit the multinomial structure of the data to develop confidence sets that are valid in finite samples. We additionally develop confidence sets using the bootstrap that are valid only approximately in large samples. We use our methodology to rank political parties in Australia using data from the 2019 Australian Election Survey. We find that our finite-sample confidence sets are informative across the entire ranking of political parties, even in Australian territories with few survey respondents and/or with parties that are chosen by only a small share of the survey respondents. In contrast, the bootstrap-based confidence sets may sometimes be considerably less informative. These findings motivate us to compare these methods in an empirically-driven simulation study, in which we conclude that our finite-sample confidence sets often perform better than their large-sample, bootstrap-based counterparts, especially in settings that resemble our empirical application.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many agricultural and environmental technologies require large upfront investments in exchange for longer-term benefits. This time profile of costs and benefits makes adoption particularly sensitive to liquidity and credit constraints, which are prevalent in low-income settings. We test the importance of these barriers to the adoption of an agricultural technique that helps reduce land degradation and restore soil fertility in Niger. We find little evidence that liquidity or credit constraints deter adoption: instead, providing farmers with training increases the share of adopters by over 90 percentage points, whereas adding conditional or unconditional cash transfers has no additional effect. Adoption increases agricultural output, reduces land turnover and leads to adoption spillovers up to three years after treatment. These results imply that training can be a cost-effective and scalable means of promoting the adoption of profitable technologies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why have white, less educated voters left the Democratic Party over the past few decades? Scholars have proposed ethnocentrism, social issues and deindustrialization as potential answers. We highlight the role played by the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  In event-study analysis, we demonstrate that counties whose 1990 employment depended on industries vulnerable to NAFTA suffered large and persistent employment losses relative to other counties. These losses begin in the mid-1990s and are only modestly offset by transfer programs.  While exposed counties historically voted Democratic, in the mid-1990s they turn away from the party of the president (Bill Clinton) who ushered in the agreement and by 2000 vote majority Republican in House elections. Employing a variety of micro-data sources, including 1992-1994 respondent-level panel data, we show that protectionist views predict movement toward the GOP in the years that NAFTA is debated and implemented. This shift among protectionist respondents is larger for whites (especially men and those without a college degree) and those with conservative social views, suggesting an interactive effect whereby racial identity and social-issue positions mediate reactions to economic policies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiproduct firms are responsible for the vast majority of global trade. A prior literature examines how multiproduct firms respond to trade liberalizations that simultaneously affect all of the firms' products and inputs.  In contrast, our study uses Chinese firm-product-level export data to examine how an AD action, a very targeted trade policy against a specific product in a specific export destination, affects a multiproduct firms' price and quantity decisions across its other products and export destinations.  We find robust evidence for a new phenomenon we call within-firm cross-product trade deflection whereby an AD duty against one of the firm's products in one of its export destinations is associated with reduced prices and increased sales of its other products across all markets. This type of effect depends on increasing costs from joint production within multiproduct firms, something that is often assumed away in many models of the multiproduct firm.  We also document for the first time a within-firm chilling effect whereby an AD action in one export destination on a product leads the firm to raise price and lower quantity of the product in other export destinations to lower the risk of AD actions in these other markets.]]></summary>

Exploiting the cross- sectional and time-series variations of lockdown, we investigate how the difficulty to use soft information has prompted a switch to hard information and its implication on fund investment, performance, and risk management. We show that lockdown reduces fund investment in proximate stocks and generates a portfolio rebalancing toward distant stocks. The re- balancing negatively impacts fund performance by reducing fund raw (excess) return of an additional 0.76% (0.29%) per month during lockdown, suggesting that soft and hard information is not easily substitutable. Lastly, we show that soft information originates mainly from physical human interactions, primarily in cafés, restaurants, bars, and fitness centers; and the virtual world based on Zoom/Skype/Team fails to substitute physical interactions fully, thus cannot provide sufficient soft information.]]></summary>

We study one explanation: beliefs are resistant to retractions (the revoking of earlier information). Our experimental design allows us to identify updating from retractions - unlearning - and to compare it with updating from equivalent new information - learning. Across different kinds of retractions - for instance, those consistent or contradictory with the prior, or those occurring when prior beliefs are either extreme or moderate - subjects do not fully unlearn from retractions and update approximately one-third less from them than from equivalent new information. While we document a number of well-known biases in belief updating in our data, our results are inconsistent with any explanation that does not treat retractions as inherently different. Instead, our analysis suggests that retractions are harder to process, for instance, due to the intimate reliance on conditional reasoning.]]></summary>

We use a pre-registered survey and experiment covering 12 countries and 22,500 respondents to examine the impact of the pandemic on public attitudes about incumbent governments, the functioning of democracy and support for different types of regimes. To estimate causal effects, we leverage experimental treatments using an instrumental variable design.

This result is driven by mistakes in future consumption's response to saving changes (i.e., changes in asset balances) and is independent of their specific behavioral foundations. My framework can accommodate many widely studied behavioral biases, such as inattention, present bias, diagnostic expectations, and near-rationality (epsilon-mistakes). This channel helps explain the empirical puzzle on high-liquidity consumers' high MPCs and can be significant. The same channel can also help explain other puzzles in intertemporal choices, such as violations of the fungibility principle, excess discounting of future income, and large risk aversion. Methodologically, I develop a general approach to study predictions of sophistication (i.e., the anticipation of future mistakes) independent of the underlying behavioral biases.]]></summary>

While traditional BFT protocols assume that most system nodes are honest (in that they follow the protocol), we recognize that blockchains are deployed in environments where nodes are subject to strategic incentives. This paper develops an economic framework for analyzing such cases. Specifically, we assume that 1) non-Byzantine nodes are rational, so we explicitly study their incentives when participating in a BFT consensus process; 2) non-Byzantine nodes are ambiguity averse, and specifically, Knightian uncertain about Byzantine actions; and 3) decisions/inferences are all based on local information. The consensus game then resembles one with preplay “cheap talk” communications. We characterize all equilibria, some of which feature rational leaders withholding messages from some nodes in order to achieve consensus. These findings enrich those from traditional BFT algorithms, where an honest leader always sends messages to all nodes. We also study how the progress of communication technology (i.e., potential message losses) affects the equilibrium consensus outcome.]]></summary>

In October 2004, Fed economist John Krainer and researcher Chishen Wei wrote a Fed letter on price to rent ratios: House Prices and Fundamental Value. Kainer and Wei presented a price-to-rent ratio using the OFHEO house price index and the Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER) from the BLS.
Here is a similar graph using the Case-Shiller National and Composite 20 House Price Indexes. This graph shows the price to rent ratio (January 2000 = 1.0). The price-to-rent ratio had been moving more sideways but picked up significantly recently.
On a price-to-rent basis, the Case-Shiller National index is back to January 2006 levels, and the Composite 20 index is back to March 2005 levels.

Construction spending during October 2021 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,598.0 billion, 0.2 percent above the revised September estimate of $1,594.8 billion. The October figure is 8.6 percent above the October 2020 estimate of $1,471.7 billion.

Private spending decreased and public spending increased:
Spending on private construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,245.0 billion, 0.2 percent below the revised September estimate of $1,247.9 billion....
In October, the estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of public construction spending was $353.0 billion, 1.8 percent above the revised September estimate of $346.8 billion.

This graph shows private residential and nonresidential construction spending, and public spending, since 1993. Note: nominal dollars, not inflation adjusted.
Residential spending is 14% above the bubble peak (in nominal terms - not adjusted for inflation).
Non-residential spending is 13% above the bubble era peak in January 2008 (nominal dollars), but has been soft recently.
Public construction spending is 8% above the peak in March 2009.
The second graph shows the year-over-year change in construction spending.
On a year-over-year basis, private residential construction spending is up 16.7%.  Non-residential spending is up 3.1% year-over-year.  Public spending is up 0.4% year-over-year.
Construction was considered an essential service during the early months of the pandemic in most areas, and did not decline sharply like many other sectors.  However, some sectors of non-residential have been under pressure.  For example, lodging is down 32.4% YoY.

This was below consensus expectations of a 0.4% increase in spending; however, construction spending for the previous two months was revised up.]]></summary>

Private sector employment increased by 534,000 jobs from   October to November according to the November ADP® National Employment ReportTM. Broadly  distributed to the public each month, free of charge, the ADP National Employment Report is produced by  the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with Moody’s Analytics. The report, which is derived from  ADP’s actual data of those who are on a company’s payroll, measures the change in total nonfarm private  employment each month on a seasonally-adjusted basis
“The labor market recovery continued to power through its challenges last month,” said Nela Richardson,  chief economist, ADP. “November’s job gains bring the three month average to 543,000 monthly jobs  added, a modest uptick from the job pace earlier this year. Job gains have eclipsed 15 million since the  recovery began, though 5 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels. Service providers, which are more  vulnerable to the pandemic, have dominated job gains this year. It’s too early to tell if the Omicron variant  could potentially slow the jobs recovery in coming months.”
emphasis added
  This was close to the consensus forecast of 525,000 for this report.
The BLS report will be released Friday, and the consensus is for 563 thousand non-farm payroll jobs added in November.  The ADP report has not been very useful in predicting the BLS report.]]></summary>

금리와 환율만 알면 경제 공부 다했다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 금리와 환율에는 국내외 경제 상황이 총체적으로 반영되어 있기 때문이다. 금리와 환율이 주가에 미치는 영향이나 상관관계에 따른 책은 많으나, 금리와 환율에만 초점을 맞추며 경제를 풀어내는 책은 찾기 어렵다. 그래서 ‘거시경제의 거장’이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 『금리와 환율 알고 갑시다』를 통해 어렵고 복잡한 경제이론과 시장의 상황을 낱낱이 분석하여 자신만의 철학으로 쉽게 명쾌하게 풀어낸다. 

지금 우리에게 필요한 것은 단순 금리와 환율의 개념이 아니다. 금리와 환율을 통해 현재의 경제 상황을 이해하고, 미래를 내다볼 수 있는 통찰력을 갖추어 조금 더 명확하게 경제의 흐름을 파악하는 안목이다. 그 깊이 있는 안목은 금리 인상(하락), 환율 변동, 집값 상승(하락) 등의 위기에도 올바른 판단과 실행을 이룰 수 있게 도와줄 것이다.

프롤로그: 금리와 환율 알고 갑시다

제1부 금리 알고 갑시다
금리란 무엇일까요?
• 금리의 기원은 신용에 있습니다
• 경제학 교과서에서는 현재의 소비를 참는 데에 대한 대가를 금리라 합니다
한국은행의 통화정책 수단, 기준금리
• 한국은행의 기준금리는 모든 금리의 기준입니다
• 기준금리는 한국은행 금융통화위원회에서 결정합니다
• 통화정책방향 결정문과 의사록은 꼭 보아야 합니다
• 비둘기파와 매파의 구분은 이렇습니다
• 한국은행은 기준금리를 왜 올리고 내릴까요?
• 기준금리는 어떻게 물가에 영향을 주나요?
• 미국의 기준금리는 연방기금금리 입니다
• 적정 기준금리 수준을 결정하는 하나의 방법이 테일러준칙이라 합니다
금리인상이 가계와 자영업자에 미치는 영향
• 금리인상으로 가계 이자부담금액이 늘어나게 되었습니다
• 금리인상으로 자영업자 부담도 더 늘어납니다
• 금리가 오르면 가계 전체적으로는 이익입니다
단리와 복리
• 저축은 복리로 해야 합니다
• 72법칙을 알아야 합니다
• 중국이 미국 GDP에 접근해가는 것도 복리의 마법에 있습니다
금리와 채권 가격은 역관계
• 금리가 오르면 채권 가격은 떨어집니다
• 채권의 수요와 공급에 따라 가격과 금리가 결정됩니다
• 금리 하락기에 채권투자를 해야 합니다
금리로 미래의 경제를 예측 — 금리의 기간구조 
• 수익률 곡선은 채권만기에 따른 수익률을 연결한 선입니다
• 장단기 금리차이가 선행지수에 앞서갑니다
• 장단기 금리차로 미래의 경제성장률도 예상해볼 수 있습니다
• 장단기 금리차이 역전은 경기침체를 예고합니다
금리로 금융시장 안정성 판단 — 금리의 위험구조
• 금융시장이 불안하면 위험 프리미엄이 확대됩니다
통화와 금리의 관계 
• 통화 공급이 늘어나면 유동성 효과로 금리가 떨어집니다
• 소득효과와 피셔효과로 금리는 다시 상승합니다
예금금리와 대출금리
• 가중평균금리를 보면 금리 추이를 알 수 있습니다
• 한국은행연합회에서 예금과 대출금리를 비교해줍니다
• 첫째, 대출금리가 어떻게 결정되는 건가요?
• 둘째, 대출금리의 종류는 어떤 것들이 있나요?
• 셋째...

Using data from matched employer-employee registers in France from 1995 to 2015, this column finds that discrepancies in pay are driven largely by men and women working in different firms rather than similar men and women being paid differently at the same firm. Understanding why the share of the gender gap ascribed to firms persists over time and across cohorts remains an essential policy puzzle for further reducing wage disparities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fannie Mae reported that the Single-Family Serious Delinquency decreased to 1.46% in October, from 1.62% in September. The serious delinquency rate is down from 3.05% in October 2020.
These are mortgage loans that are "three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure".
The Fannie Mae serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 5.59% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.32% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
Click on graph for larger image
By vintage, for loans made in 2004 or earlier (1% of portfolio), 4.02% are seriously delinquent (down from 4.25% in September).  For loans made in 2005 through 2008 (2% of portfolio), 6.90% are seriously delinquent (down from 7.21%),  For recent loans, originated in 2009 through 2021 (97% of portfolio), 1.17% are seriously delinquent (down from 1.31%). So, Fannie is still working through a few poor performing loans from the bubble years.
Mortgages in forbearance are counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once they are employed.

Excerpt: 
Both the Case-Shiller House Price Index (HPI) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) HPI for September were released today. Here is a graph of the month-over-month (MoM) change in the Case-Shiller National Index Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
The MoM increase in Case-Shiller was at 1.18%; still historically high, but lower than the previous 13 months. House prices started increasing sharply in the Case-Shiller index in August 2020, so the last 14 months have all been historically very strong, but the peak MoM growth is behind us - and the year-over-price growth is starting to decelerate.
...

As I discussed in How Much will the Fannie & Freddie Conforming Loan Limit Increase for 2022?, the FHFA HPI is used to determine the increase in the Conforming Loan Limit.  The relevant quarterly index, the Expanded-Data Indexes (Estimated using Enterprise, FHA, and Real Property County Recorder Data Licensed from DataQuick for sales below the annual loan limit ceiling), was released this morning, and it was up 18.04% YoY.   The actual 2022 CLL will be released later.

지난 2,000년 사이에 지구의 온도는 1도 정도를 오르내리는 선에서 안정적으로 유지되었다. 덕분에 인류는 살아남아 번영을 구가했고 전 세계 인구는 70억까지 늘어났다. 그러나 지금의 세계는 지구온난화로 인한 기상이변으로 돌이킬 수 없는 타격을 입고 있다. 경제적 측면에서도 위기의 상황에 접어들었다. 

이에 저자는 지금 당장 국가, 기업이 탄소 중심의 경제 체제에서 벗어나 재생에너지, 전기자동차 등 저탄소 경제 체제로 변화하지 않으면 미래는 없다고 단언하고 이미 기후위기를 기회로 만드는 국가와 기업들의 사례를 통해 우리에게 나아가야 할 방향을 제시한다.

존 엘킹턴 지음, 정윤미 옮김 / 더난출판사 / 2021년 12월 / ISBN:9788984054202
정가: 17,000원 / 판매가: 15,300원 / 마일리지: 72원
이벤트: 화제의 책+알라딘 사은품(이벤트 도서 포함, 국내도서 4만원 이상)




회복과 재생을 촉진하는 새로운 미래 자본주의 모델 안내서 《그린 스완》이 출간됐다. 그린 스완은 지난 2007년 뉴욕대학교 교수 나심 니콜라스 탈레브가 제시한 용어 ‘블랙 스완’에서 파생했다. 블랙 스완은 가능성이 극히 적지만, 일단 발생하면 돌이킬 수 없을 정도의 엄청난 충격을 주는 사건을 말한다. 9.11 테러나 2008년 세계 금융위기가 그 대표적인 예다. 그린 스완은 ‘해결책’을 더한, ‘자본시장의 변화를 촉진하는 개념’으로 지속가능성 측면에서 새롭게 정의한 미래 자본주의 모델이라고 할 수 있다. 

이 책은 이미 시작된 ‘변화의 징후’를 읽는 10가지 용어인 목적, 비즈니스 모델, 수익, 성장, 가치, 임팩트, 책임, 중대성, 지배구조, 좌초자산을 통해 세계 경제의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있음을 확인한다. 기업에서 전례가 없는 엄청난 사안에 직면하게 될 때, 종종 ‘사악한 문제’가 발생한다. 예를 들면 담배 회사는 흡연이 수많은 질병을 일으킨다는 것을 알면서도 그 문제를 은폐해왔고, 결국 거대한 액수의 벌금을 선고받아야 했다.

저자가 지적하는 사악한 문제는 크게 다섯 가지다. 플라스틱 쓰레기로 오염된 바다, 살인자 칼로리, 항생제가 초래한 슈퍼버그, 탄소가 급격히 기온을 상승시킨 것, 심각하게 증가한 우주 쓰레기다. 책에서는 이를 해결하기 위한 다섯 가지 패러다임을 짚어내고, 그린 스완의 특성을 지닌 자본주의와 민주주의 그리고 지속가능성을 제시한다. 저자는 세계 기업들에 다음과 같이 엄중하게 윤리성을 촉구한다.

‘공정한 보상’의 저자 신재용 교수는 ‘MZ세대에게 ‘공정’이란 노력에 대한 정당한 대가를 의미하는 매우 실용적인 개념’이라고 말한다. 부도 신분도 대물림되는, 별다른 출구가 없는 이 세대가 살아남기 위해 강조하는 레토릭(rhetoric)이 바로 ‘공정’인 것이다. 

MZ세대는 ‘교환(exchange)’이라는 틀로 세상을 본다. 신재용 교수는 이 책에서 화이트칼라 MZ세대의 특수한 성장배경을 분석하며, 학창시절부터 통과의례처럼 거듭한 토너먼트 경쟁 끝에 현재의 직장에 자리한 이들에게 ‘투입한 노력에 상응하는 대가’를 받는 공정한 교환관계를 유지하는 것이야말로 자신을 지키는 일임을 밝힌다.

01 왜 지금 공정한 보상인가?
공정이 최고의 가치다: 공정성에 민감한 MZ세대의 등장
화이트칼라 MZ세대가 생각하는 공정은 다르다
화이트칼라 MZ세대는 왜 공정한 보상에 더 민감한가?
MZ세대의 토너먼트 연대기
더 이상 비밀은 없다-MZ세대의 소속기반 커뮤니티
왜 갑자기 지금? 최근의 성과급 논란
SK하이닉스 성과급 논란: 이천 쌀집에서는 무슨 일이 있었나?
EVA=영업이익-세금-자본비용

02 무엇이 공정한 보상인가?
보상을 보는 두 가지 이론
기본급 결정을 위한 세 가지 실무
한국기업의 성과급: 인재의 영입, 유지, 동기부여의 도구인가?
한국의 MZ세대 직장인들은 보상을 공정하다고 생각할까?
보상은 무엇에 근거해야 하는가?
공정과 “운”의 필터링
글로벌 기업 CEO 보상을 둘러싼 논쟁
[더 알아보기1] 암젠(Amgen)의 CEO 성과보상 사례
[더 알아보기2] 사회적 가치 혹은 사회성과에 근거한 보상
[더 알아보기3] 넷플릭스 드라마 ‘오징어 게임’에서 나오는 게임들 중 가장 공정한 게임은?

03 성과에 근거한 보상: 성과측정과 인센티브 설계
성과목표는 왜 필요할까?
성과지표의 선정
성과-보상 간 민감도 결정

04 임직원 보상격차
우리 사장님은 얼마 받고 일하실까?
나도 언젠가 그 자리에 올라갈 수 있으니까-토너먼트 이론
임원은 직원의 몇 배를 받아야 할까?
토너먼트 이론과 공정성 이론은 공존할 수 있을까?
중요한 것은 승진가능성!
전무, 상무의 동기부여가 직원보다 더 중요하다

05 어디로 나아갈 것인가? 보다 공정한 보상을 위한 제언
MZ세대의 보상에 대한 요구를 이해하고 제도를 정렬하라
집단을 넘어 개인의 성과로: 역량 있는 관리자의 육성부터 시작하자
평가/보상의 투명성이 중요하다
직급 중심에서 역할 중심으로, 획일적인 보상에서 다양한 보상으로
성장할 수 있는 기회도 보상의 일부다

This morning we found ourselves in the uncomfortable position of watching the bond market backtrack on massive gains at the end of the previous week.  This is always a risk when the market goes on a big run--especially on a Friday.  But rather than continue to erase Friday's gains, bonds found their footing in the 10am hour as a part of a broader "risk-off" move. [30 year fixed 3.21%]

KUDOS also to the residents of the 16 states and D.C. that have achieved 60% of total population fully vaccinated: New York at 68.4%, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Virginia, New Hampshire, Oregon, District of Columbia, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Delaware, Florida, and Hawaii at 60.9%.

The following 19 states have between 50% and 59.9% fully vaccinated: Wisconsin at 59.5%, Nebraska, Iowa, Utah, Michigan, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Nevada, South Dakota, North Carolina, Alaska, Ohio, Kentucky, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri and Indiana at 50.6%.

Next up (total population, fully vaccinated according to CDC) are Tennessee at 49.5%, Georgia at 49.4%, Arkansas at 49.3%, Louisiana at 48.9% and North Dakota at 48.7%.

Markets are mostly suspicious of left-wing populism but view the electoral success of right-wing populist parties as unequivocally favourable, possibly because of the tendency for the political and economic elite to collude.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
The key in 2022 will be inventory.  If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in prices.  However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.   Towards the end of each year, I collect some housing forecasts for the following year.
...

For house prices, there is a very wide spread. As of August, Case-Shiller house prices were up 19.8% year-over-year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Fed Chair Powell's prepared testimony: Coronavirus and CARES Act, Excerpt on inflation: 
Most forecasters, including at the Fed, continue to expect that inflation will move down significantly over the next year as supply and demand imbalances abate. It is difficult to predict the persistence and effects of supply constraints, but it now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year. In addition, with the rapid improvement in the labor market, slack is diminishing, and wages are rising at a brisk pace.
emphasis added
And on the new COVID variant: 
The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation. Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions.
Powell will provide his testimony tomorrow at 10AM ET: Coronavirus and CARES Act, Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]]></summary>

협동조합기본법 시행 10년, ‘협동조합 2만 개 시대’를 맞아 지나온 역사와 현실 상황을 살피고, 한국의 협동조합은 무엇을 해야 할지 모색하며 새로운 대안으로 ‘협동조합 허브론’을 제시한다.

협동조합 운동의 본질은 협동하려는 인간에 대한 신뢰를 바탕으로 자유롭고 평등한 사회를 만들겠다는 인류의 꿈을 실현하는 것이다. 그러나 갈수록 심해지는 불평등과 인류의 존재 자체를 위협하는 기후 위기 앞에서 그 꿈은 닿을 수 없는 이상에 불과한 것 아닌가 하는 회의의 정서가 짙다. 

책은 그런 참혹한 현실을 직시하면서, 그럼에도 불구하고 협동조합만이 할 수 있는 영역이 분명히 있음을 확인한다. 그것은 협동조합이 작은 협동의 경험들을 이어 큰 협동으로 나아가는 접착제 역할을 하고 사회 곳곳을 협동으로 연결하는 허브가 되는 것이다.

김기태, 강민수 두 저자는 한국 협동조합 운동의 산증인으로, 현장은 물론 협동조합 연구 분야에서도 혁혁한 성과를 보여 주었다. 이제 협동조합 허브론이라는 새로운 운동론을 제안하며 40년 전 레이들로가 ICA(국제협동조합연맹) 모스크바 대회에서 제기한 협동조합의 정체성에서 한 걸음 더 나아갈 것을 촉구한다.

북한과 인접한 해안가에는 파도에 떠밀려 온 북한 생활 쓰레기가 가득하다. 이 지역에서 수거한 북한 생활 쓰레기 제품 포장지는 모두 708종의 1,414점이다. 당과류와 음료류는 물론 식품류와 잡화류 그리고 의약품까지 실로 그 종류가 엄청나다. 

자력갱생을 강조하는 북한에서 어떻게 이리도 다양한 상품을 만들어 내는지 그저 의아할 뿐이었다. 그렇게 하나둘 모은 생활 쓰레기는 북한 사회를 읽는 소중한 자료이자 보물이 되었다. 생활쓰레기 포장지는 북한 제품의 브랜드와 디자인, 생산공장 현황 그리고 정치선전을 엿볼 수 있다. 북한사람들의 흔적이 고스란히 담긴 서해안의 <평양마켓>으로 함께 떠나보자.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[앞으로 100년 : 인류의 미래를 위한 100장의 지도
이언 골딘 외 지음, 권태형 외 옮김 / 동아시아 / 2021년 11월 / ISBN:9788962624045
정가: 32,000원 / 판매가: 28,800원 / 마일리지: 120원
이벤트: 화제의 책+알라딘 사은품(이벤트 도서 포함, 국내도서 4만원 이상)




옥스퍼드 마틴 스쿨의 창립자이자 세계화 및 국제 개발 분야의 권위자인 이언 골딘과 정치학, 안보학 분야의 석학인 이가라페 연구소의 로버트 머가가 함께 쓴 책이다. 수십 년 간 축적된 연구 및 데이터에 최신의 위성 사진 및 지도 자료를 결합시켰다. 세계화, 기후, 도시화, 불공정, 폭력, 보건, 인구…, 인류가 맞이하고 있는 열네 가지의 중대한 국면을 낱낱이 분석하고 각 현안들을 명쾌한 이미지로 시각화하여 보여준다.

19세기 광고계의 거물이었던 프레드 버나드는 “한 장의 이미지가 천 마디의 말보다 낫다”라는 말을 남겼다. 그 말처럼, 『앞으로 100년』에서 이언 골딘과 로버트 머가가 전하는 메시지는 구체화된 이미지를 통해 사람들에게 가닿는다. 인류가 지구에 어떤 영향을 미치고 있을까? 지금 인류가 지구 위에서 지속 가능한 삶을 꾸려가려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 북극에서 일어나는 화재, 전 세계에서 동시다발적으로 일어나는 해수면의 상승, 이민자에 대한 사람들의 편견과 그 이면의 진실…. 

이 모두를 단순한 말이 아니라 구체적인 이미지로 전달한다. 다양한 방식으로 제작된 100장을 훌쩍 넘어서는 지도와 인포그래픽은 압축적이면서도 설명적이다. 저자들은 때로는 우리의 직관에 어긋나기도 하는 세계의 단면을 냉철하게 제시한다. 그러면서도 그 목소리에는 호소력이 있다. 왜냐면 그들에게는 인류가 맞이한 문제와 앞으로 나아가야 할 방향에 대한 명확한 비전이 있기 때문이다.

저자들이 제시하는 것은 이 지구 위에서 인류가 살아남고, 지속 가능한 삶을 살기 위한 거대한 로드맵이다. 이 책은 인류가 미지의 땅을 헤쳐나가기 위해 집어들어야 할 필수적인 생존 가이드북이다.

모바일과 인터넷을 삶에서 결코 떼어낼 수 없는 젊은 세대이든, 종이 신문이 오히려 익숙한 ‘올드 제너레이션’이든, 하루도 빠짐없이 맞닥뜨리게 되는 언어들이 있다. 많은 이들이 그저 고개를 갸우뚱할 뿐 또렷하게 이해하지 못 하는, 그렇다고 딱히 물어볼 데도 없고 네이버로 검색을 해봐도 속 시원하게 개념이 정리되지도 않아 어정쩡한 채로 머릿속을 맴도는, 저 숱한 경제용어들이 바로 그 언어다. 싹 무시해버릴 수도 없고 그렇다고 들러붙어 공부하기도 쉽지 않은 이 용어들은 대체로 몇 개의 타입으로 나뉜다. 

이해하기 난감한 최신 경제용어 160개를 선정해 제목처럼 ‘명쾌하고 야무지게’ 해설한 책을 독자들에게 제시한다. 단순한 개념 정의는 말할 것도 없거니와, 그 용어가 생겨난 배경이나 경제 환경, 그 용어가 우리의 일상생활, 직장생활, 그리고 투자 활동에 미치게 될 영향이나 충격, 해설을 한층 더 생생하게 만들어주는 실제 기업이나 인물들의 사례, 좀 더 수월한 이해를 도와줄 이미지와 도표와 차트 및 통계치, 향후 경제의 흐름을 어느 정도 예측할 수 있게 도와주는 전문가들의 조언에 이르기까지. 

이 책 한 권이면 골치 아팠던 핵심 경제용어들이 또렷이 이해되어 친하게 다가올 뿐 아니라, 마지막 장을 덮을 때쯤이면 누구나 ‘나름 경제전문가’의 경지에 이를 수 있을 것이다. 물론 현명하고 민첩한 재테크 기술의 습득은 짜릿한 보너스다.

중앙일보 경제부 기자들과 함께 ‘금융 SOS’를 연재하고 있는 경제 기자가 쓴 책이다. 누구나 한 번쯤은 가족간 돈거래, 부동산, 빚, 기타 금융사고 등으로 인해 어려움을 겪는다. 하지만 금융 관련 직종 종사자나 전공자가 아니고서야 인터넷을 구석구석 뒤진다 해도 해결책을 찾기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니다. 

이 책은 그런 어려움을 겪는 이들에게 상비약이 되어줄 유용한 경제지침서이다. 저자는 흔히 벌어지는 각종 금융 사건·사고의 다양한 실제 사례를 직접 취재하고, 변호사와 금융 전문가들의 자문을 받아 그에 대한 ‘해결책’을 찾는 데 초점을 맞추었다.

일반 독자들에게 단순히 ‘어떻게 하면 돈을 잘 모을 수 있는지’와 같은 경제와 금융 관련 정보를 전달하는 데 그치는 것이 아니라, 금융에 대해 잘 알지 못하는 일반 사람들, 특히 금융 사각지대에 놓인 이들에게 실질적인 도움을 주기 위해 쓰였다. 개인 혼자 해결하기 어려운 금융문제의 대처법을 일목요연하게 정리했다.

지은이의 말_일상 속 ‘돈’ 문제로 힘들 때 가정 상비약이 되어줄게요

1장 가족간 돈 거래는 남보다 더 ‘깐깐하게’
부모에게 돈을 빌렸다면 ‘연 4.6% 이자’를 납부해야

“며느리야, 이혼하면 상가는 안 준다” 이혼계약서 쓰는 부자들
“집 줄게, 효도해라” 효도도 계약서 쓰는 시대 
형제간 재산싸움을 막으려면 부모의 유언장이 필수
떠난 딸 몫을 원하는 사위, 한푼도 주기 싫은 장인의 방어책은? 
7배 폭등한 남편의 비트코인, 이혼 때 남편이 “산 적 없다” 잡아떼면?
현금자산이 10억을 넘으면 ‘육십분’ 전략을 쓰자
평생 일군 회사, ‘가업’ 승계도 전략이 필요하다

2장 돈 쓰는 지혜를 알아야 돈이 모인다
피트니스센터 이용권 결제 시 먹튀에 대비해 영수증을 챙기자
통신사·신용카드 포인트를 1원도 허투루 버리지 않는 법
코로나19와 아시아나 M&A, ‘내 마일리지’는 어쩌죠?
‘앗, 택시에 서류가방을’ 신용카드로 분실물 찾는 방법은?
주차장 붙박이 운전자와 초보 운전자를 위한 자동차보험은?
1년에 한두 번 병원 찾는데 4세대 실손보험으로 갈아탈까?
자녀 학비 마련 위해 예금 대신 삼성전자 주식 사준다
불황에 더 빛나는 예물 재테크, 순금 목걸이와 팔찌 세트 어때요?
13월의 월급을 챙기는 연말정산 4가지 전략

3장 내 인생의 최대 숙제인 ‘집’
전세계약이 2년 더 연장될까? 만약 집주인이 거주하겠다고 하면?
전세 낀 집을 살 때는 ‘세입자 계약 만료 시점’을 꼭 확인해야
육아문제로 부모와 집을 합치면 1주택자 비과세 혜택을 못 받나?
20대 자녀 명의로 집을 샀다면 1주택자로 취득세를 내야 할까?
개인회생을 신청해도 주택 압류를 막을 수 있다

부동산문제를 해결하려면, 성경 희년법과 포도원 천국 비유의 시장원리대로 토지사용자가 세貰(토지임료)를 내는 지대시장제와 토지주식제를 해야 한다. 지대시장제는 “반값으로 내 땅, 내 집”, 세금까지 사라진다. 지대시장제는 100% 사유재산제와 시장자유가 보장되는 경제원리이다.

머리말
‘40일 토지 정탐’과 ‘40년 토지 실험’
사람에게 한 가지 더 부족한 것

일러두기

제1편
땅과 사람

제1장 가족의 기업과 부동산시장의 수수께끼
기업 무르기 이야기 / 부동산시장의 수수께끼 / 790만 원이 1억 원으로 / 사상 초유 ‘1억 원 내기토론’ 성사될까? / ‘1억 원 내기’는 아직도 유효합니다
제2장 땅값의 발견과 토지 예찬
[복숭아와 복숭아씨] = [토지임료와 땅값] / 토지 예찬 / 만나와 오병이어 / 만나와 오병이어보다 더 큰 기적은 / 인간사人間史와 지구사地球史―사람이 경제적 땅(지구)을 보지 못한 혼돈의 세상사 / 땅값은 지구가격, 사람에게는 너무 크고 길어서… / 바닷물도 사용으로 줄일 수 없습니다 / 쓸 수 있는 상품가격과 쓸 수 없는 땅값
제3장 토지 무르기에서 찾아내는 인간 구원
구원이란? / 원죄原罪와 원빚原負債 / 몸값과 땅값은 빚 중의 빚입니다―땅값은 원빚原負債입니다 / 죄들은 사해지고, 빚들은 없애 버려야 합니다
부동산문제의 근본적 원인과 해법을 찾는 과학적 설명회 요청
처음에 / 땅값 이해를 위한 질문 / 땅값의 성질과 부동산문제의 근본 해법을 찾기 위한 설명회 요청

제2편
희년법의 재발견―속량의 원천·자유의 뿌리

제4장 성경의 희년법으로 들어가면서
레위기의 구조와 성경 희년법 / 희년법은 사유재산제와 시장경제의 원리입니다 / 희년법은 경제학이 풀어야 했습니다 / 성경 희년법은 시장경제의 신호등입니다
제5장 본문으로 소개하는 성경 희년법(토지 속량법)
안식년―땅은 사람처럼 일하고 쉬며, 사람이 없어도 스스로 산물을 내고 있다 / 희년―토지 무르기로 땅값(원빚)이 사라져서, 토지가 돌아오면, 백성들은 자유를 누린다 / 성경이 허용한 토지거래법 / 성경이 금지한 토지거래법 / 토지 무르기―토지 속량법, 무르기가 완성되면 자유가 최고로 보장되는 희년이 온다
제6장 레위기 희년법의 경제적 접근과 이해
땅에 대한 인간 오해―땅을 상품으로 보는 것은 인간의 과학적 오류 / 성경 토지법: 땅은 스스로 생산한다 / 성경 토지법: 토지는 생산될 열매의 연수를 따라 팔고 사라 / 성경 토지법: 토지는 영원히 팔리지 말라 / 성경 토지법: 토지를 시한부로 팔았으면(세를 놓았으면) 무르기를 하라 / 토지거래와 무...

대중에게 건설업은 어떤 이미지로 각인되고 있을까? 건설산업은 한국 경제 발전의 핵심 토대를 이루며, 성장을 견인하는 역할을 충실히 해왔다. 특히 1950년대 한국전쟁으로 폐허가 된 우리나라는 각종 기반시설의 구축, 주택 등을 비롯한 수많은 건축물의 건설을 통해 양적, 질적 성과를 이룩했다. 우리나라를 지금의 선진국 반열에 올려놓은 원동력의 중심에는 과거 건설산업이 있었다.

하지만 건설산업은 낮은 생산성과 수익성, 그리고 시대의 변화에 따르지 못하는 업계 관행 등으로 점차 국가 산업에서 점점 경쟁력을 잃어갔다. 특히 3D업종, 부실공사, 부정부패, 환경파괴, 담합, 폭리 등 일반 대중이 생각하는 건설업에 대한 부정적인 이미지는 건설산업이 성장하고 미래를 설계하는 데에 큰 걸림돌이 되고 있다. 건설업에 대한 부정적 이미지는 그저 인식으로만 그치는 것이 아니라, 산업현장에서는 일자리 기피 현상으로도 나타나고 있다.

《이코노컨스트럭션》의 저자는 우리나라 건설업이 걸어온 발자취를 들여다보며, 한국 경제에서 건설산업이 얼마나 큰 비중을 차지하고 또 국가 경제에 얼마만큼의 기여를 했는지 자세히 설명해준다. 전성기 건설업의 모습만을 조명하는 것은 아니다. 건설업이 경쟁력을 잃었던 원인 그리고 건설업의 어두운 면을 살펴봄으로써, 국가 경제의 큰 비중을 차지하는 건설업의 현재를 진단하고 더 나은 내일을 준비할 수 있도록 독려한다. [more...]

저소득층의 고통은 한층 커졌으며 집값은 천정부지로 뛰어 내 집 마련은 아무나 꿀 수 없는 꿈이 되고 말았다. 이렇게 무너진 한국경제를 다시 일으켜 세워야 하는 것은, 2022년 출범하는 새 정부의 숙명적 과제일 것이다. 이를 위해 국내 최고 경제정책 전문가 10인이 모여 ‘성장과 혁신’, ‘재정과 복지’, ‘부동산·금융·공정거래’, ‘노동, 저출산’ 등 9개의 어젠다를 제시한다. 

이 책에서는 정부가 추진해온 ‘소득주도성장론’과 ‘집값 안정 정책’은 실패했다고 분석하며, 경제의 기본 원리를 다시 복원해야 한다고 말한다. 저성장 극복 방안, 디지털시대의 혁신역량 강화, 국가 재정전략 수립, 주택시장 정상화 해법, 금융 산업과 서비스업의 경쟁력 제고, 초저출산 사회의 과제 등 한국경제를 정상궤도로 돌려놓기 위한 혁신전략을 담은 이 책은 대한민국의 경제 발전을 위한 가장 믿음직스러운 정책서가 되어줄 것이다.

급격한 기후변화와 코로나19로 인한 전 세계적 경제 충격으로 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 친환경적 움직임이 가속되고 있다. 전 세계 주요국은 친환경차 보급 확대를 지원하고 있으며, 이를 위한 인프라 구축에 많은 돈을 쏟아붓고 있다. 

자동차 산업과 직결되는 재생 에너지는 호시탐탐 기회를 엿보던 몇몇 국가의 새로운 성장 동력이 된 지 오래다. 또한 한국뿐 아니라 많은 나라에서 그린 뉴딜 정책으로 일자리를 창출해 코로나19로 인한 경제 침체를 극복하고자 한다. 즉 우리는 이러한 모빌리티 산업과 에너지 산업의 역학 관계에 주목할 필요가 있다.

대격변의 시대, 두 산업에서 투자자의 시선은 어디로 향할 것인가? 현대차증권의 장문수, 강동진 연구위원은 전 세계를 뒤바꿔놓을 거대한 흐름을 다각도로 분석한다. 주요국의 친환경차 관련 주요 정책 및 코로나19로 인한 경영 환경의 변화는 물론, 테슬라·도요타·폭스바겐 등 글로벌 모빌리티 기업의 친환경 대응 전략과 재생 에너지 기술의 핵심 역량을 조망한다. 이 책을 통해 에너지와 모빌리티 산업의 변화상을 들여다본다면 위기 속에서 새로운 기회를 잡을 수 있을 것이다.

‘부조리’, ‘불공정’, ‘불투명’에 맞서 싸우는 경제 전문가이자, 한국 경제 ‘팩트 저격수’로 잘 알려진 최배근 건국대 교수의 최신간. 그는 이 책에서 개혁 정부의 실패를 바라는 부패세력이 어떻게 경제적 사실을 왜곡하고, 부정적 여론으로 확산시키는지 풍부한 데이터를 통해 흥미롭게 분석한다. 

특히 ‘언론-포털-경제관료-야당’으로 이어지는 부패 기득권 카르텔에 주목하며, 그들이 어떻게 한국 경제를 ‘사익 추구’의 방편으로 활용하고 있는지 낱낱이 파헤친다. 모피아를 중심으로 한 경제관료들이 문재인 정부에서 ‘재정 안정’이라는 명목으로 소득주도성장, 부동산 세제 개편, 전 국민 재난지원금 지급 등의 개혁 정책에 맞서 ‘태업한’ 적나라한 증거들을 공개한다.

Prologue_ ‘그들’을 막지 못하면 대한민국의 진전은 없다 

I부. 경제 ‘지표’를 부정하는 사람들

4. 왜 ‘소득주도성장’은 멈춰 섰을까 _‘어공’의 미흡한 준비, ‘늘공’의 완강한 저항
__팩트 파인더: 소득주도성장은 계속돼야 한다
5. 2020년 부동산 폭등, 이미 예견된 것이다 _모피아와 언론의 합작품
6. 보수언론이 원하는 세상은 ‘모두가 좋은 세상’이 아니다 _사익을 취하는 자들
7. 절대로 일본을 이길 수 없다는 믿음 _아베의 경제침략을 이겨낸 이유
8. GDP 증가율 세계 1위에 담긴 진실 _K-방역과 K-민주주의

II부. K-방역이 실패해야 하는 사람들
 ― 경제 효과 너머의 가치 

1. 누가 K-방역을 흔드는가 _부패세력의 생존 방정식
2. “한국은 이미 선진국이다” _K-방역이 가져온 기저효과
3. 그들이 ‘전 국민’ 재난지원금을 막으려는 이유 _선별복지라는 위선
4. 방역과 경제 2마리의 토끼를 잡아야 한다 _새로운 경제 생태계
5. K-브랜드, K-민주주의의 기회가 되다 _우리가 만든 ‘문법’

III부. ‘부동산 폭등’을 즐기는 사람들
 ― 폭등 뒤에 숨은 검은 배후

1. ‘LH 사태’가 말해주는 것 _부패의 기원 
__팩트 파인더: 반칙과 특권에 기생하는 부동산-금융 카르텔
2. 문재인 정부 부동산 정책 실패의 기원 _예고된 신뢰 추락
3. 왜 민주 정부의 부동산 정책은 항상 실패하는가 _부동산 카르텔의 힘 

IV부. ‘재정안정주의’의 그늘에 숨은 사람들
 ― ‘모피아’ 관료들이 살아가는 방식 

1. ‘혁명의 언어’가 된 전 국민 재난지원금 _‘88%’의 비밀
2. 모피아가 재정지출에 반대하는 이유 _재정 사유화
__팩트 파인더: ‘나랏돈’이 쌓인다는데, 무엇이 문제일까?
3. 제2의 윤석열, 최재형은 계속된다 _언론, 검찰, 모피아
4. 경제관료 못 잡으면 ‘K-민주주의’ 없다 _‘늘공’ 통제 시스템
__팩트 파...

지금까지 사람들은 직장과 가족 등에서 안정감을 얻고 유대를 획득해왔다. 그러나 이제 직업은 표준과 안정이 아닌 불안정의 상징이다. 삶은 유동성에 지배되고 있다. 이에 순응하듯 긱잡, 프리터, N잡러 같은 저고용 방식들이 확산되고 있다. 결혼과 가족 또한 안전판으로서의 제도가 아닌 예측 불가능한 사건이 되었다. 그렇다면 현대인들은 이런 전통적인 공동체 대신 무엇으로부터 정체성의 위기를 해소하고 안정감과 유대감을 찾고 있을까? 바로 취향이다. 회사 회식은 싫지만 취향 모임에는 기꺼이 참석하며, 가족과 함께 TV를 보는 대신 SNS와 게임 친구들과 소통한다. 

도서출판 따비의 신간 《취향의 경제―취향의 시대는 산업과 소비를 어떻게 바꾸는가》는 취향을 추구하는 개인들이 경제와 산업을 어떻게 바꾸어냈는지를 논증하며, 취향의 추구가 불평등과 혐오를 완화하는 방향으로 나아가려면 무엇이 필요한지 모색한다.

우리 시대가 직면한 긴박한 문제들―이민, 세계화, 자동화와 실업, 경제 성장과 불평등, 기후변화, 정부의 역할 등―을 해결하려면 경제학이 필요하다. 하지만 경제학은 지금까지는 너무나 경직적인 이상의 세계에서 이론적 모델과 같은 대안만 내놓았다. 저자들은 마치 저 높은 하늘에만 떠 있던 경제학을 우리가 살고 있는 땅, 즉 현실로 끌고 내려와 실증 근거들을 기반으로 우리 사회의 큰 문제들을 실제로 해결하기 위한 방법을 파고든다. 

노벨상 수상 경제학자 배너지와 뒤플로는 경제학이 제대로만 수행된다면 (그러니까 ‘좋은 경제학’이) 우리 시대의 가장 첨예한 사회적, 정치적 난제들을 해결하는 데 일조할 수 있다고 말한다. 이주 문제부터 불평등까지, 성장의 둔화부터 기후변화의 가속화까지, 우리는 거대한 어려움에 직면해 있다. 하지만 그 어려움을 헤쳐 나갈 수 있는 자원과 역량이 없는 것도 아니다.

이 책은 우리에게 이런 문제들을 해결할 새로운 관점을 독창적이고 도발적이며 시의적절하게 제시한다. 저자들의 깊은 통찰을 통해, 아슬아슬한 균형 위에 서 있는 우리 세계의 문제점과 역량 모두를 더 올바르게 이해할 수 있게 될 것이다.

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.

개발자에게 바치는 머신러닝 가이드북이다. 철저하게 개발자의 시선에서 접근하고 실제 산업계에서 자주 사용되는 모델에 관해 설명한다. 동시에 신경망의 원리와 기초 구현 방법, 케라스 라이브러리의 사용법과 텐서플로를 활용한 모델 배포 방안도 포함한다. 복잡한 머신러닝 이론 대신, 간단한 AI 구현 코드를 보여주면서 구조와 프로세스를 설명한다. 그리고 초보 학습자가 궁금해할 문제를 선별하여 이러한 문제와 연계해 새로운 내용을 소개한다. 이 책의 모든 장에서 비슷한 방법을 사용하고 있다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

이 책의 예제 코드와 함께 홈페이지 회원들에게만 제공하는 회원특전 PDF는 예제와 라이브러리 사용법 간이 매뉴얼로 성안당 홈페이지(www.cyber.co.kr) [도서몰]에 회원가입 후 [자료실]-[자료실] 바로가기에서 도서 검색을 통해 다운로드할 수 있다.
