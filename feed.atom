I'm looking at data for some second home markets - and will track those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through June 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.
  
   Click on graph for larger image.
Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Note that inventory was high while prices were declining - and significantly lower inventory in 2012 suggested the bust was over.  (Tracking inventory helped me call the bottom for housing way back in February 2012, see:The Housing Bottom is Here)
Currently inventory is still very low, but solidly above the record low set three months ago, and prices are up sharply YoY.   This will be interesting to watch.]]></summary>

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.9 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.6 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. This was the largest 1-month change since June 2008 when the index rose 1.0 percent. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.4 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending August 2008.
  
The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 10.5 percent in June. This increase accounted for more than one-third of the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.8 percent in June, a larger increase than the 0.4-percent increase reported for May. The energy index increased 1.5 percent in June, with the gasoline index rising 2.5 percent over the month.
The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.9 percent in June after increasing 0.7 percent in May. Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel. The index for medical care and the index for household furnishings and operations were among the few major component indexes which decreased in June.
The all items index rose 5.4 percent for the 12 months ending June; it has been trending up every month since January, when the 12-month change was 1.4 percent. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.5 percent over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1991. The energy index rose 24.5 percent over the last 12-months, and the food index increased 2.4 percent.

We closed out last week on a fence about the short term outlook for rates.  On the one hand, Friday was fairly weak.  On the other hand that weakness followed 3 great days of gains and could furthermore be rationalized as defensive positioning ahead of early risks in the week ahead.  We made it through half of those risks on Monday (3 and 10yr Treasury auction) with minimal damage, but certainly no major gains.  As such, bonds look like they're keeping their options open for now.  We hope to get a better lay of the land after tomorrow's events (CPI and 30yr bond auction).  [30 year fixed 3.09%]

A week ago, inventory was at 373 thousand, and was down 44.0% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 21.6% above the record low in early April.

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases, although still well below a normal rate for June.]]></summary>

U.S. rail volumes in June 2021 and Q2 2021 were consistent with an economy that’s growing but  has more growing to do. Total U.S. carloads in June 2021 and Q2 2021 were up 19.1% and 23.8%,  respectively, over the same periods in 2020 as easy comps led to big year-over-year percentage gains.  That said, total carloads in Q2 2021 were the most for any quarter since Q4 2019.
...
On the intermodal side, U.S. originations in Q2 2021 were the most ever for a quarter, and  intermodal volume in the first six months of 2021 were the most ever for the first six months of a year.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the six week average of U.S. Carloads in 2019, 2020 and 2021:
Total originated carloads were 1.18 million in  June 2021, up 19.1% (188,164 carloads) over June 2020  and down 5.5% from June 2019.
...
Carloads excluding coal were up 14.1% in June 2021 over June 2020 and down 4.3% from June 2019. 
The second graph shows the six week average of U.S. intermodal in 2019, 2020 and 2021: (using intermodal or shipping containers):
U.S. intermodal originations, which are not  included in carloads, rose 10.9% in June 2021 over June  2020, their 11th straight year-over-year gain. In June,  intermodal averaged 277,349 containers and trailers per  week, the second most for June on record (behind June  2018).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: The year-over-year occupancy comparisons are easy, since occupancy declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic.  So STR is comparing to the same week in 2019.
The occupancy rate is down 0.1% compared to the same week in 2019 (easy comparison due to the timing of July 4th).  Leisure (weekend) occupancy has recovered, but weekday (more business) is still down.

From CoStar: STR: Weekly US Hotel Occupancy Dips as June Yields to July
U.S. hotel occupancy dipped while average daily rate (ADR) was up from previous weeks and the comparable period in 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through July 3.
June 27 through July 3, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 65.4% (-0.1%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): US$135.35 (+5.8%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$88.51 (+5.7%)
 While occupancy was down because of the holiday week, overall comparisons were more favorable because of low performance during the corresponding week from 2019. That week in 2019 was lower due to the 4th of July falling on a Thursday.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.
Click on graph for larger image.
The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Occupancy is well above the horrible 2009 levels and weekend occupancy (leisure) has been solid.
Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


With solid leisure travel, the Summer months should have decent occupancy - but it is uncertain what will happen in the Fall with business travel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of July 6th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Significant Improvement in Active Forbearances
In our last post, we mentioned that last week’s minor reduction in forbearance plans had “set us up nicely for what could be a larger improvement next week as some 218,000 plans were still scheduled for review by Wednesday, June 30.”
Well, that larger improvement arrived this week.
Since last Tuesday, the overall number of active plans has dropped by 189,000, pushing the population of homeowners in forbearance down below 2 million for the first time early in April of last year.
The decline, as mentioned above, was driven by the large volume of early entrants reaching their 15-month quarterly review, and significant declines were seen across all investor classes. 
  
Click on graph for larger image.
  
Loans held in bank portfolios and private label securities led the way with a 78,000 reduction in plans, while FHA/VA and GSE forbearance volumes dropped by 67,000 and 44,000 respectively.
All in all, that puts us down 254,000 (-12%) from the same time last month.
  
Nearly two thirds of the more than 325,000 plans reviewed for extension or removal over the prior week resulted in exits. That’s the highest weekly exit rate in more than six months and the highest weekly removal volume since the first wave of plans went through their 12-month reviews a few months ago.
Forbearance plan starts also continue to fall, with both new and repeat starts down this week for a total of fewer than 26,000, a new pandemic-era low.
As of July 6, 1.86 million (3.5% of) homeowners remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans including 2.2% of GSE, 6.8% of FHA/VA and 4.6% of Portfolio/PLS loans. Another 400,000 plans are scheduled to be reviewed for extension/removal over the next 30 days.

지난 30여 년간 6번의 정권이 바뀌는 동안, 그 어떤 정부도 말하지 않은 ‘한국 경제 불변의 법칙’이 있다. 경제의 진짜 성장능력을 나타내는 장기성장률이 1990년대 초 이후 매 5년마다 1%포인트씩 미끄럼틀 타듯이 지속적으로 추락해온 ‘한국 경제 5년 1% 하락의 법칙’이 그것이다. 

이 암울한 법칙은 매우 강력하여 보수, 진보 정권에 상관없이 그 위력을 발휘해왔을 뿐만 아니라, 2003년 사스, 2015년 메르스 등 전염병 사태가 발발하고 1997년 외환위기, 2008년 글로벌 금융위기 등 경제위기가 있었지만 이 위기들 이전과 이후 상관없이 한국 경제를 주도해왔다. 

그럼에도 어떤 정부도 지속적 경제 하락 추세를 국민들에게 알리지 않았고, 표를 얻기 위해 ‘신기루 경제정책’을 펼치고도 정권을 잡았다. 그런 다음 임기 동안 단기적 성장률을 높이는 데만 집중하며 경기부양정책을 펼쳐왔다. 고통스러운 제로성장의 도래를 그 다음 정부로 떠넘기고자 ‘폭탄 돌리기’를 지속해온 것이다.

저자인 서울대학교 경제학부 김세직 교수는 첫 단독저서 『모방과 창조』를 통해 한국 경제에 이 퇴행의 법칙이 계속 작동하면 향후 장기성장률이 0%대의 제로성장에 처해 디스토피아적 상황을 맞이하게 됨을 강력히 경고한다. 소득의 극심한 감소를 피하기 위해서는, 하루 빨리 추락…]]></summary>

From the NTREIS for North Texas (including Dallas/Ft. Worth):
Single Family Homes sold in June 2021 were 11,554, down 2.9% from 11,896 in June 2020.

The National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC)’s Rent Payment Tracker found 76.5 percent of apartment households made a full or partial rent payment by July 6 in its survey of 11.7 million units of professionally managed apartment units across the country.
  
This is a 0.9 percentage point decrease from the share who paid rent through July 6, 2020 and compares to 79.7 percent that had been paid by July 6, 2019. This data encompasses a wide variety of market-rate rental properties across the United States, which can vary by size, type and average rental price.

This graph from the NMHC Rent Payment Tracker shows the percent of household making full or partial rent payments by the 6th of the month compared to 2019 and to the first COVID year. 

Although payments are down from 2019, rent payments are mostly unchanged from last year.
This is mostly for large, professionally managed properties.
The second graph shows full month payments through June compared to the same month the prior year.

For June, rent payments were down compared to June 2019 and 2020.

 Following six months of consecutive gains, the Dodge Momentum Index fell to 165.8 (2000=100) in June, down 5% from the revised May reading of 175.1. The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Data & Analytics, is a monthly measure of the first (or initial) report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year.
  
The decline in June was the result of losses in both institutional planning, which fell 7%, and commercial planning, which lost 4%.
  
Uncertain demand for some building types (such as retail and hotels), higher material prices, and continued labor shortages are weighing down new project planning. Even with June’s decline, however, the Momentum Index remains near a 13-year high and well above last year. Compared to a year earlier, both commercial and institutional planning were significantly higher than in June 2020 (39% and 46% respectively). Overall, the Momentum Index was 41% higher.

This graph shows the Dodge Momentum Index since 2002. The index was at 165.8 in June, down from 175.1 in May.
According to Dodge, this index leads "construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year".  This index suggests a decline in Commercial Real Estate construction through most of 2021, but a pickup towards the end of the year, and growth in 2022 (even with the decline in the June index).]]></summary>

우리는 부동산 문제 해결이 그저 ‘정책’으로는 되지 않는다는 사실을 깨달아야 한다. 오늘날 한국 사회는 부동산으로 이득을 보는 걸 당연시하며, 그런 관점 아래 법제도와 사회구조 및 관습 등이 구성돼 있다. 한마디로 이것은 ‘체제’의 문제인 것이다. 그리하여 한국은 ‘불로소득 유발형 부동산체제’가 굳게 자리잡고 말았다. 

당연히 한두 가지 정책 도입만으로 이런 체제는 꿈쩍도 하지 않는다. 분명한 철학과 확고한 원칙, 그리고 체계적이고 종합적인 정책 패키지가 결합된 토탈 솔루션이 필요하다. 이 책 『불로소득 환수형 부동산체제론』은 체제의 관점에서 부동산 문제에 접근한 최초의 시도로, 부동산체제의 코페르니쿠스적 전환을 제안하고 있다.

'중국 특색의 사회주의'가 신시대에 접어들면서 아름다운 생활을 갈망하는 인민들의 요구는 날고 강렬해졌고, 날로 광범해졌다. 동시에 발전 불균형과 불충분으로 나타난 문제들을 해결하지 못했기에 발전 품질과 효익이 높지 못했다. 민생영역에는 아직도 많은 단점들이 있다. 사회문명은 향상되어야 하고 사회모순과 문제도 중첩되어 있다. 이 책은 시진핑 신시대 '중국 특색의 사회주의' 사상 연구를 담았다.

제1장 경제체제 개혁을 끝까지 진행하자
 1. 경제체제 개혁은 중국의 모습을 변화시켰다
  (1) 개혁은 중국경제 총량이 부단히 새로운 단계에 오르도록 했다
  (2) 개혁은 인민들의 생활을 최저생활 수준에서 전면적인 샤오캉사회로 발전시켰다
  (3) 개혁은 중국의 국제경쟁력을 현저하게 향상시켰다
  (4) 중요 영역과 관건적인 부분에서의 개혁은 돌파적인 진척을 가져왔다
 2. 개혁은 이미 관건적인 단계에 진입했다
  (1) 중국의 경제성장은 여전히 체제적 요소의 영향을 크게 받고 있다
  (2) 점진적 개혁에서 전면적 개혁의 심화로
  (3) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 일부 사람들의 이익을 건드릴 수 있다
 3. 반드시 실속 있게 개혁을 추진해야 한다
  (1) 전면적 개혁의 심화는 혁명과도 같은 것이기에 반드시 실속 있게 진행해야 한다
  (2) 개혁을 돌파할 수 있는 관건은 실시하는 데에 있다
  (3) 개혁을 하려는 자를 등용하고, 개혁을 하려하지 않는 자를 해임하는 인재등용의 방식을 지향해야 한다
 4. 오직 개혁개방 만이 중국을 발전시키고, 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다
  (1) 개혁개방은 백년 목표의 실현을 결정하는 관건이다
  (2) 경제체제 개혁은 전면적 개혁을 심화시키는 중점이다
  (3) 발전을 포용하고 지속시키려면 개혁을 심화시키는 것에 의존해야 한다
  (4) 오직 개혁개방만이 사회주의를 발전시킬 수 있다

세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사까지 한 번에 명화로 쉽고 재미있고 빠르게 이해하는 경제 교양서. 역사를 잘 몰라도, 미술에 조예가 깊지 않아도, 경제 까막눈이어도 누구나 부담 없이 즐길 수 있는 명화 속 경쾌한 ‘경제’ 이야기. 재미있는 회계 강의로 유명한 현직 회계사인 저자답게 편안하고 재치있는 입담으로, 어렵게 느껴지던 세계사와 경제사는 물론 미술사의 주요 흐름을 쉽고 재미있게 들려준다. 

중세 이탈리아에서부터 현대 미국까지 가난과 역병, 전쟁, 혁명의 위기와 불안을 극복해온 각 나라의 경험은 물론, 화가들의 반전 있는 마케팅 전략같이 생각지 못한 미술과 관련된 경제 이야기가 경쾌하게 펼쳐진다. 또 수없이 많은 위기를 되풀이해온 역사 속 인간의 다양한 경제 활동과 명화에 담긴 사람들의 욕망과 지혜에서 불안의 시대를 살아나갈 용기와 희망을 찾아볼 수 있다.

『C++로 나만의 운영체제 만들기』의 후속편으로, 저자가 직접 제작한 YUZA OS라는 OS를 파헤쳐 보면서 운영체제의 구조와 원리를 설명한다. 리눅스 같은 기존의 운영체제 개발환경에서 벗어나 윈도우 운영체제에서 OS를 개발하며 비주얼 스튜디오 2019와 C++로 운영체제 개발 방법을 설명하는 것이 특징이다. 아울러 저자가 게임 개발자 출신답게 다양한 게임을 자신만의 OS에서 쉽게 제작할 수 있는 방법을 설명하는 것에 심혈을 기울였다.

미국의 노동 운동가이자 작가인 리오 휴버먼은 “역사책에는 이런저런 왕들의 야망과 정복 그리고 전쟁에 관한 이야기가 장황하게 이어지는데, 왕들의 이야기보다는 왕권 배후에 있는 진정한 힘, 곧 그 시대의 상인과 금융업자의 이야기에 지면을 할애하는 편이 훨씬 나았을 것이다”라고 말했다.

세계 역사를 이끌어온 힘은, 왕이 아닌 상인과 금융업자에게서 나왔다는 얘기다. 실제로 세계를 뒤흔든 전환점이라 일컫는 포르투갈의 대항해, 네덜란드 중상주의 발흥, 영국의 산업혁명과 자본주의의 전개, 신대륙의 부흥, 미국의 눈부신 성장 등은 상인과 금융업자의 역사이자, 특히 유대인에 의해 시작되고 완성된 역사라는 사실을 부정할 사람은 없을 것이다. 

『유대인 이야기』의 저자인 경제학자 홍익희는 자본주의를 탄생시키고 세계 경제를 이끌어온 유대인의 역사, 그 가운데서도 오늘날의 금융혁명을 일으키고 세계 산업을 재편한 로스차일드 가문에 주목하였다.

경제대항해 시대, 한국호를 둘러싼 조류와 파도, 바람, 비의 방향과 세기를 점검하고 향후 한국호의 최적 운항 전략과 방법론을 모색하고자 쓰였다. 최적의 솔루션은 외부 위기 요인과 내부 역량에 대한 엄격한 점검에서 나올 수밖에 없다. 따라서 저자는 ‘도전의 실체’와 ‘응전의 능력’을 함께 평가하는 지난한 작업을 벌이고 있다.

저자는 지난 10여 년간 언론에 게재한 칼럼들을 주제별로 나눠 이 책에 수록하였다. 칼럼을 취사선택하지 않고 있는 그대로 모두 실었다. 칼럼의 제목(큰 제목, 부제)과 내용 또한 언론에 나간 그대로이다. 단 한 자의 가필도 수정도 없었다. 동일한 주제에 대해 현재에서 과거로 거슬러 올라가는 시간의 여정을 밟고 있다. 과거의 칼럼이 현재 칼럼의 배경이자 역사가 되어 페이지를 더할수록 스스로 설명이 되는 구조를 택했다.

칼럼 뒤에는 국제분야 주요 시사용어에 대한 친절하고도 자세한 설명과 함께 현재 시점에서 필자가 칼럼에 대해 느끼는 소회와 관련 경제 지식들을 제시하였다. 특히 ‘지식 한 토막’에서는 유발 하라리와 베르베르, 폴 크루그만, 바그와티, 그레이엄 앨리슨, 마이클 스펜스 등 세계적인 작가와 학자들의 흥미진진한 분석과 이론들이 총망라되어 소개되고 있다.

2020년 벤처 투자 시장은 펀딩 6조 원 시대를 여는 새로운 역사를 썼다. 코로나19는 팬데믹이라는 유례없는 위기를 몰고 왔지만 동시에 많은 기업에게 기회의 장도 제공한 것이다. 많은 일반 투자자들의 관심이 특히 바이오 종목으로 집중되었지만 사실 수년째 바이오는 벤처 캐피털 업계(VC)에서 가장 핫한 투자 섹터로 자리 잡고 있었다. 

그중에서도 황만순 한투파 대표는 남다른 존재감을 발휘해왔다. 2020년만 해도 3,500억 원대의 바이오 섹터 펀드를 결성했고 지놈앤컴퍼니, 젠큐릭스, 엔젠바이오 등의 기업을 상장시키는 등 지금까지 바이오 헬스케어 분야에만 190여 개 기업에 7,500억 원 이상을 투자해왔다.

『대한민국 바이오 투자』는 바이오 섹터에 생소한 일반 개인 투자자의 질문에 대한 답변 형식으로 구성되었으며 바이오 섹터 투자에 있어 꼭 알아야 할 기초적인 관련 지식과 절대 실패하지 않는 투자 방식, 그리고 지녀야 할 마음가짐까지 친절하게 설명한다. 저자는 지난 20년 벤처 캐피털리스트로서 쌓은 경험을 나누고 싶어 이 책을 쓰게 되었으며 독자분들께 조금의 도움이라도 되길 원한다고 담담하게 이야기한다.

세상을 움직이는 33가지 핵심 경제이론을 깔끔하게 정리한 경제 입문서다. 리처드 세일러의 ‘넛지 이론’, 대니얼 카너먼의 ‘전망 이론’, 쉬나 아이엔가의 ‘상품 선택의 법칙’ 등 행동경제학과 게임이론에서부터 현대 화폐 이론(MMT)과 피케티의 21세기 자본론까지 꼭 알아야 할 최신 경제이론을 한 권에 담았다. 

또한 애덤 스미스의 ‘보이지 않는 손’, 리카도의 비교우위론, 케인스의 유효수요론, 슘페터의 경기순환론 등 역사적으로 중요한 경제이론들이 어떻게 발전해오며 세계를 변화시켰는지 살펴본다. 경제이론과 실물 경제가 어떤 지점에서 어긋나는지, 경제이론의 한계도 지적한다. 이 책은 세상을 움직이는 경제의 원리를 쉽지만 제대로 이해하고 싶은 사람들에게 유용한 가이드가 될 것이다.

지금은 버블인가, 아닌가? 현재 상황을 두고 개인 투자자들은 물론 전문가들도 의견이 팽팽하게 맞선다. 급변하는 현재를 어떻게 해석하고 행동을 취해야 하는가? 거대한 전환점에 서 있는 우리는 이익을 얻는 사람이 될 것인가, 잃는 사람이 될 것인가? 이 책은 인류 최초의 버블부터 현재까지 300년 역사를 뒤흔든 버블의 사태를 살펴본다. 왜, 무엇이, 버블을 만들었으며 누가 그것을 이용해 부를 잃고 누군가는 이익을 얻었는지 반복되는 호황과 불황의 주기를 바탕으로 통찰력을 제공한다.

저자들은 ‘시장성·자본·투기’가 만드는 거품 경제를 ‘버블 트라이앵글’이라고 분석하며 새로운 프레임워크를 제시한다. 역사상 버블의 사태는 이 3가지 요건의 비이성적 패턴을 가졌다는 것이다. 사회적 변화와 이슈가 있을 때마다 전 세계 경제는 대전환기를 맞아왔다. 코로나 19가 지핀 전 세계 경제 변화는 씨앗의 형태가 다를 뿐, 역사상 최초의 현상이 아니다. '파이낸셜타임스'가 선정한 올해의 책이자, 급변하는 경제 상황을 분석하고 새로운 프레임워크를 제시하는 <버블 : 부의 대전환>을 통해 거인의 어깨, 놀라운 통찰에서 그 답을 구해보자.

경제학의 기본 개념과 그와 관련한 세부 용어들을 고사성어와 섞어 설명한다. 여기에 현실의 예를 더해 ‘고사성어’와 ‘경제용어’가 ‘이야기’라는 공통분모 속에서 독자에게 흥미롭고 효과적으로 다가오도록 했다.

자원과 자본 등 경제의 기초 개념을 1장에서 다루었으며, 수요에 관한 기본 개념을 2장에서 다루었다. 3장에서는 교환과 노동, 임금, 기회비용 등 생산에 얽힌 경제용어를 다룬다. 4장에서는 시너지 효과, 범위의 경제, 파레토의 법칙 등 경제의 효율성을 설명하는 고사를 소개한다. 

기업과 시장 경제에 관한 이야기는 5장에서 소개하며, 6장에서는 살면서 접하게 되는 갖가지 마케팅의 이면을 소개해놓았다. 7장에서는 그레셤 법칙과 함께 금본위제도와 금산분리 등 금융 전반을 다룬다. 8장에서는 낙수효과와 소득격차, 구조조정에 따른 실업의 문제와 물가와 경제성장에 관련한 거시경제의 모습들을 설명한다. 

9장에서는 공유지의 비극과 코즈 정리, 역선택, 모럴해저드 등 미시경제 문제를 <갈택이어, 연못 물을 빼어 고기를 잡다>라는 제목으로 다룬다. 마지막으로 10장은 조세피난처와 경제정책, 금리, 국제 경제에 관한 문제를 다룬다.

차세대 산업혁명인 4차 산업혁명은 지금껏 상상만 해 왔던 기술들을 점차 현실화시키고 있다. 많은 이들이 우려하는 대로 이러한 기술의 진보가 인간의 일자리를 빼앗는 일이 이미 벌어지고 있다. 얼마 전까지만 해도 사람이 제공하던 서비스들을 이제 AI(인공지능)나 로봇 등의 기계가 대신 하는 일이 급속히 늘고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 본격적으로 진행될수록 이런 현상은 더욱 가속화할 것이다.

저자는 일과 일자리 관점에서 볼 때 4차 산업혁명은 인간의 사고를 뿌리까지 바꾸게 함으로써 이전과는 완전히 다른 세상을 도래하게 만드는 ‘변곡점’이 될 것이라 확신하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명을 통해 발전할 기술들로 인해 기존의 일자리 대다수가 사라질 가능성이 농후하기 때문이다. 

많은 이들이 4차 산업혁명의 기술적 성취에 취해 장밋빛 미래를 그리고 있는 지금, 저자는 다음과 같은 질문을 던진다. 4차 산업혁명이 성공적으로 마무리되고 나면 우리는 기술 진보의 혜택을 마음껏 향유할 수 있을까? 현재와 같은 우리 일자리는 남아 있을까? 그때에도 우리는 먹고살기 위해 일해야 할까? 모든 면에서 인류를 능가하는 AI가 등장해도 우리는 지금처럼 생태계 최정상의 지위를 유지할 수 있을까?

이 책은 인류 문명 탄생부터 AI와 로봇까지, 일과 일자리 변천사를 일목요연하게 정리하고 있으며, 4차 산업혁명이 앞선 산업혁명들과 본질적으로 어떤 차이가 있으며 어느 정도의 파급력을 가질지에 대해 통찰력 있는 전망을 내놓고 있다. 그리고 기술 진보가 예고된 미래 세상을 디스토피아가 아닌 유토피아로 만들기 위해 지금 인류가 어떤 준비를 해야 하는지에 대해서도 구체적인 방안을 제시한다.

<요약>

본 연구는 북한당국이 발표하는 지역별 토지가격이나 토지의 특성에 관한 자료들이 없는 조건에서 북한지역의 토지가격과 토지자산의 규모를 추정하는 방법론과 모형을 제시하고 이를 이용하여 북한 시가화지역 전체를 대상으로 시장가격 기준의 토지자산 규모를 실험적으로 추정하였다.   우선 관련 사회경제적 변수를 이용가능하면서 최근의 북한과 소득수준의 격차가 상대적으로 크지 않았던 것으로 평가되는 남한의 1970년대 중후반, 그리고 도시화 수준이 유사했던 1980년대 초반 남한의 시, 군, 구별 실거래가격을 기준으로 시가화지역 토지에 대한 지가결정함수를 도출하였다. 다음으로 북한지역에 대한 지리정보분석을 통해 도출되는 지가결정요인의 대리변수들을 대입하여 2015년경 북한 시가화지역 토지의 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율을 산출하였다. 더 나아가서 최근 북한지역 일부 도시들을 대상으로 조사된 주택거래가격과 본고에서 추정한 상대가격비율을 결합하여 북한전역을 대상으로 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모를 추정하였다.  추정결과 북한 시가화지역의 토지가격은 시, 군, 구역별 상대가격비율로 볼 때 평양시 동대원구역이 100으로 제일 높고 양강도 풍서군이 1.70으로 가장 낮은 것으로 평가되었다. 한편 시가화지역의 토지자산 규모는 2015년 기준 216억 달러로 추정되었는데, 이는 동년 북한GDP의 1.2~1.3배에 달하는 규모이다.  이 비율은 남한의 1978~1980년과 비슷한데, 해당시기의 남한의 경제성장률이 평균 6%인데 반해 북한은 1%대 수준인 것을 고려하면 상당히 높은 것으로 보인다.]]></summary>

본 연구에서는 2017년과 2019년 이민자 체류실태 및 고용조사 자료를 이용하여 직업훈련 프로그램이 외국인의 노동시장 성과에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 성향점수매칭(propensity score matching)을 적용한 분석 결과를 살펴보면, 직업훈련은 평균적으로 외국인들의 고용률을 6.4%p 높였으며 월평균임금을 상승시키는 효과도 있었다. 또한, 체류자격에 따라 상이한 효과가 나타났는데 먼저 취업비자로 들어온 외국인은 훈련참여의 결과로 고용률이 크게 높아지지 않았지만 임금 상승효과는 상당히 컸다. 반면, 결혼이민자의 경우 임금에 대한 긍정적 효과가 관찰되지 않았다. 정주비자 소지자는 훈련을 통해 고용률과 임금이 모두 증가하였다.]]></summary>

<요약>

본 연구는 1981년부터 2019년까지 한국의 생산가능인구 1인당 실질 GDP 추세성장률을 추정하기 위해 추세성장률이 임의보행을 따르는 비관측요인모형을 사용한다. 추정 결과, 추세성장률은 외환위기를 극복하던 시기인 2000년 전후를 제외하고 1980년대 후반부터 2010년대 초반까지 지속해서 하락하였다. 추세성장회계를 통해 추세성장률 하락요인을 분석한 결과, 지속적인 추세성장률 하락은 노동생산성 둔화와 관련이 깊은 것으로 나타났다. 구체적으로 살펴보면, 1988년부터 1998년까지의 추세성장률 1차 하락기는 외환위기 이전부터 둔화되기 시작한 노동증강 총요소생산성에 가장 큰 영향을 받았다. 이러한 결과는 외환위기로 추세성장률이 하락했다는 가설과는 배치되는 것이다. 한편 부진한 투자는 2002년부터 2012년까지의 2차 하락기의 중요한 배경인 것으로 나타났다.]]></summary>

[라이노 파이썬]은 라이노 환경과 사용법에 어느 정도 익숙한 독자를 대상으로 하고 있으며, 파이썬 언어를 활용한 라이노 프로그램의 조형 연구 및 제어를 다루고 있다. 이 책의 근본적인 목적은 특정 언어 및 프로그램의 사용법을 익히게 하는 것이 아니라, 건축 디지털 디자인과 관련된 프로그래밍에 대한 기본적인 이해를 돕고 3D 프로그램과의 연동 및 그 가능성을 탐구하도록 하는 것이다. 

건축 디자이너로서 프로그래밍을 어떻게 받아들여야 하는지, 프로그래밍은 무엇을 할 수 있는지, 스크립트를 쓸 때는 어떻게 생각해 나가야 하는지, 기본적인 바탕으로 숙지해야 되는 내용은 무엇인지 등 디지털 디자인에 대한 생각을 정리하고, 직접 뛰어들어 써 나갈 수 있도록 방향을 제시할 수 있는 조력자의 역할을 수행하고자 한다.

오랫동안 학자들은 인간 행동도 바이러스처럼 우연한 접촉을 통해 전파된다고 믿었다. 그러나 새로운 믿음이나 행동, 규범의 확산은 질병의 확산과는 다른 규칙을 따른다. 무엇보다 이러한 변화들은 개인의 삶을 뒤바꿀 뿐 아니라 기업과 정부, 세계 질서에 거대한 전환을 불러온다. 아무도 경험하지 못한 대변혁의 길목에서 이제는 ‘변화는 어떻게 일어나는가’라는 근본적인 질문을 던져야 하는 이유다.

이 책은 우리 주변에서 발생하는 크고 작은 변화의 메커니즘을 과학적으로 밝힌다. 변화는 어떻게 일어나고, 찻잔 속 태풍으로 끝나는 일이 왜 그토록 많은가? 가망 없어 보이던 혁신이 안착하고, 논란을 동반한 홍보 캠페인이 승리를 거두고, 비주류로 불리던 운동이 세상을 뒤흔든 데에는 어떤 비밀이 숨어 있는가?

20년 넘게 방대한 연구를 이어온 저자는 그 핵심이 소셜 네트워크, 즉 사회적 연결망에 있음을 증명해낸다. 복잡한 전염(complex contagion)이라는 개념에 따르면, 기존의 믿음과 규범을 흔드는 변화일수록 가족이나 친구, 동료처럼 끈끈하게 연결된 관계가 확산의 성패를 좌우한다. 소수의 유명 인플루언서와 오피니언 리더가 다수를 움직인다는 통념이 뒤집히는 순간이다.

전 세계를 강타한 코로나19 바이러스의 대유행으로 수억 명의 감염자와 수백만 명의 사망자가 발생하면서 지구촌 전체가 큰 위기를 맞고 있다. 4차 산업혁명과 인공지능을 기반으로 한 과학기술의 발전으로 인류는 보다 편리하고 풍요로운 미래를 맞이하게 되었지만 디지털 전환과 맞물려서 가속화된 비대면 방식의 삶과 급격한 일자리 변화는 그동안 우리 사회를 움직여왔던 메커니즘에 상당한 충격을 안겨 주었다.    

《팬데믹과 한국 사회의 대전환》은 국내를 대표하는 5인의 석학들이 코로나 이후 한국 사회를 진단하고 뉴노멀을 향한 시대의 갈림길에서 인간, 사회 그리고 세상에 대한 근원적인 질문을 던진다. 고(故) 박태준 포스코 명예회장 10주기 추모 학술 연구로 2020년 12월 진행된 ‘포스텍 미래 전략 좌담회’ 내용을 정리한 이 책에서는 팬데믹 상황에서 위기에 처한 우리의 안전과 자유’를 다시 생각해 보고 시장경제의 변화가 민주주의에 어떠한 영향을 미치는지 살펴본다. 

또한 인류가 처했던 역사적 위기 상황을 현재와 비교하고 해결책을 제시하며, 팬데믹으로 가속화된 불평등과 양극화 현상의 이유와 탈진실의 시대에 우리가 어떻게 생각하고 행동해야 이러한 위기를 극복할 수 있는지 살펴본다.
