        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study global trade responses to the US-China trade war. We estimate the tariff impacts on product-level exports to the US, China, and rest of world. On average, countries decreased exports to China and increased exports to the US and rest of world. Most countries export products that complement the US and substitute China, and a subset operate along downward-sloping supplies. Heterogeneity in responses, rather than specialization, drives export variation across countries. Surprisingly, global trade increased in the products targeted by tariffs. Thus, despite ending the trend towards tariff reductions, the trade war did not halt global trade growth.]]></summary>

Customers, as opposed to transactions per customer or dollar sales per transaction, consistently account for about 80% of sales variation. The top 1% of growing and shrinking merchants account for about 70% of customer and sales reallocation in a given year. In order to illustrate some of the potential implications, we write down an endogenous growth model with and without the customer margin. In the context of this model, we find that the customer margin dramatically increases the size and growth contribution of the largest firms, but lowers the aggregate growth rate by diverting resources from research to customer acquisition activities.]]></summary>

Under such demand equivalence, researchers can use time series evidence on fiscal multipliers to recover the general equilibrium "missing intercept" of shocks to private spending identified in the cross section. I apply this method to deficit-financed stimulus checks, and find a) a large direct consumption spending response, and  b) a fiscal multiplier of one and so a missing intercept close to zero. I also discuss the robustness of this aggregation approach to empirically plausible violations of demand equivalence.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For whom has earnings risk changed, and why? To answer these questions, we develop a filtering method that estimates parameters of an income process and recovers persistent and temporary earnings for every individual at every point in time. Our estimation flexibly allows for first and second moments of shocks to depend upon observables as well as spells of zero earnings (i.e., unemployment) and easily integrates into theoretical models. We apply our filter to a unique linkage of 23.5m SSA-CPS records. We first demonstrate that our earnings-based filter successfully captures observable shocks in the SSA-CPS data, such as job switching and layoffs. We then show that despite a decline in overall earnings risk since the 1980s, persistent earnings risk has risen for both employed and unemployed workers, while temporary earnings risk declined. Furthermore, the size of persistent earnings losses associated with full year unemployment has increased by 50%. Using geography, education, and occupation information in the SSA-CPS records, we refute hypotheses related to declining employment prospects among routine and low-skill workers as well as spatial theories related to the decline of the Rust-Belt. We show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. Lastly, we find that rising persistent earnings risk while employed (unemployed) leads to welfare losses equivalent to 1.8% (0.7%) of lifetime consumption, and larger persistent earnings losses while unemployed lead to a 3.3% welfare loss.]]></summary>

Time-series analysis for each province and for France, Italy and Germany corroborates this finding, and we estimate cumulative gains of up to 5 percentage points in provincial vaccination rates and 790,000 or more first doses for Canada as a whole as of October 31, 2021 (5 to 13 weeks after the provincial mandate announcements). We also find large vaccination gains in France (3 to 5 mln first doses), Italy (around 6 mln) and Germany (around 3.5 mln) 11 to 16 weeks after the proof of vaccination mandate announcements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We develop a machine-learning solution algorithm to solve for optimal portfolio choice in a detailed and quantitatively-accurate lifecycle model that includes many features of reality modelled only separately in previous work.  We use the quantitative model to evaluate the consumption-equivalent welfare losses from using simple rules for portfolio allocation across stocks, bonds, and liquid accounts instead of the optimal portfolio choices. We find that the consumption-equivalent losses from using an age-dependent rule as embedded in current target-date/lifecycle funds (TDFs) are substantial, around 2 to 3 percent of consumption, despite the fact that TDF rules mimic average optimal behavior by age closely until shortly before retirement. Our model recommends higher average equity shares in the second half of life than the portfolio of the typical TDF, so that the typical TDF portfolio does not improve on investing an age-independent 2/3 share in equity. Finally, optimal equity shares have substantial heterogeneity, particularly by wealth level, state of the business cycle, and dividend-price ratio, implying substantial gains to further customization of advice or TDFs in these dimensions.]]></summary>

When interventions are ex post efficient, a government cannot commit not to inject capital into the banking system. Contrary to common wisdom, we show that the government may still avoid moral hazard and implement the first best allocation by using the distribution of bailouts across banks to provide ex ante incentives. In particular, we analyze properties of credible tournament mechanisms that provide support to the best performing banks and resolve the worst performing ones, including through mergers. Our mechanism continues to perform well if banks are partially substitutable, and if they are heterogeneous in their size, interconnections, and thus systemic risk, as long as bailout funds can be targeted to particular banks.]]></summary>

At the industry level, improvements in technology are associated with higher labor productivity but a decline in the labor share. Exploiting variation in the extent certain technologies are related to specific occupations, we show that technological innovation has been largely associated with worse labor market outcomes—wages and employment—for incumbent workers in related occupations using a combination of public-use and confidential administrative data. Panel data on individual worker earnings reveal that less educated, older, and more highly-paid workers experience significantly greater declines in average earnings and earnings risk following related technological advances. We reconcile these facts with the standard view of technology-skill complementarity using a model that allows for skill displacement.]]></summary>

Using a reduced-form, gravity-based econometric model for monthly trade, we estimate the effects of COVID-19 incidence rates, policy restrictions imposed by governments to curb the outbreak, and the de facto reduction in human mobility/lockdown effect on global agricultural trade through the end of 2020. We find that while agricultural trade remained quite stable through the pandemic, the sector as a whole did not go unscathed. First, we estimate that COVID-19 reduced agricultural trade by the approximate range of 5 to 10 percent at the aggregate sector level; a quantified impact two to three times smaller in magnitude than our estimated impact on trade occurring in the non-agricultural sector. Second, we find sharp differences across individual commodities. In particular, we find that non-food items (hides and skins, ethanol, cotton, and other commodities), meat products including seafood, and higher value agri-food products were most severely impacted by the pandemic; however, the COVID- 19 trade effect for the majority of food and bulk agricultural commodity sectors were found to be insignificant, or in a few cases, positive. Finally, we also examine the effects across low vs high income countries, the changing dynamics of the pandemic’s effect on trade flows, and the effects along the extensive product margins of trade.]]></summary>

Ancestral stress is associated with longevity after age 45 of male-line grandsons but not of granddaughters or female-line grandchildren.  I rule out transmission through socioeconomic channels and direct cultural transmission from grandfather to grandson.  An epigenetic explanation is consistent with observed male-line transmission at epigenetically sensitive ancestral ages and mediation by own late gestational conditions.    Consistent with epigenetic reprogramming depending on the in-utero environment, the association between the veteran's ex-POW status and that of his male-line descendants declines across generations.]]></summary>

Despite the large decrease in reimbursement rates, we find no evidence that the policy affected the amount of health care that injured workers receive or recoveries after injuries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From housing economist Tom Lawler:
Based on publicly-available local realtor/MLS reports released across the country through today, I project that existing home sales as estimated by the National Association of Realtors ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.45 million in November, up 1,7% from October’s preliminary pace but down 2.1% from last November’s seasonally adjusted pace.  Unadjusted sales should be little changed from a year earlier, with the SA/NSA difference reflecting this November’s higher business day count relative to last November’s.
Local realtor reports, as well as reports from national inventory trackers, suggest that the YOY % decline in the inventory of existing homes for sale last month was larger than was the case in October.
Finally, local realtor/MLS reports suggest the median existing single-family home sales price last month was up by about 13.0% from last November. 
CR Note: The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is scheduled to release November existing home sales on Wednesday, December 22, 2021, at 10:00 AM ET.  The consensus is for 6.20 million SAAR.   Take the over.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
This update adds Austin, California, Des Moines, Memphis, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Sacramento.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 15.3% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 26.7% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 23.4% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market.

From CoStar: STR: US Weekly Hotel Occupancy Improves From Previous Week
U.S. hotel performance increased from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through December 11.
December 5-11, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 57.4% (-4.8%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $128.35 (+2.3%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $73.73 (-2.7%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Although down compared to 2019, the 4-week average of the occupancy rate is now above the median rate for the previous 20 years (Blue).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: November Housing Starts: Most Housing Units Under Construction Since 1973
Excerpt: 
The fourth graph shows housing starts under construction, Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
Red is single family units. Currently there are 752 thousand single family units under construction (SA). This is the highest level since March 2007.
For single family, most of these homes are already sold (Census counts sales when contract is signed). The reason there are so many homes is probably due to construction delays. Since most of these are already sold, it is unlikely this is “overbuilding”, or that this will impact prices.
Blue is for 2+ units. Currently there are 734 thousand multi-family units under construction.  This is the highest level since July 1974! For multi-family, construction delays are probably also a factor. The completion of these units should help with rent pressure.
Census will release data next year on the length of time from start to completion, and that will probably show long delays in 2021.  In 2020, it took an average of 6.8 months from start to completion for single family homes, and 15.4 months for buildings with 2 or more units.
Combined, there are 1.486 million units under construction. This is the most since 1973.

Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in November. The indexes for both manufacturing and mining increased 0.7 percent, while the index for utilities decreased 0.8 percent.
At 102.3 percent of its 2017 average, total industrial production in November was 5.3 percent above its year-earlier level and at its highest reading since September 2019. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.3 percentage point to 76.8 percent; even so, it was 2.8 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2020) average.

This graph shows Capacity Utilization. This series is up from the record low set in April 2020, and above the level in February 2020 (pre-pandemic).
Capacity utilization at 76.8% is 2.8% below the average from 1972 to 2020.  This was at consensus expectations.
Note: y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the change.

The second graph shows industrial production since 1967.
Industrial production increased in November to 102.3.  This is above the February 2020 level.
The change in industrial production was slightly below consensus expectations.]]></summary>

Housing Starts:
Privately‐owned housing starts in November were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,679,000.  This is 11.8 percent above the revised October estimate of 1,502,000 and is 8.3 percent above the November 2020 rate of 1,551,000.  Single‐family housing starts in November were at a rate of 1,173,000; this is 11.3 percent above the revised October figure of 1,054,000. The November rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 491,000.
  
Building Permits:
Privately‐owned housing units authorized by building permits in November were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,712,000.  This is 3.6 percent above the revised October rate of 1,653,000 and is 0.9 percent above the November 2020 rate of 1,696,000.  Single‐family authorizations in November were at a rate of 1,103,000; this is 2.7 percent above the revised October figure of 1,074,000.  Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 560,000 in November.

The first graph shows single and multi-family housing starts for the last several years.
Multi-family starts (blue, 2+ units) increased in November compared to October.   Multi-family starts were up 37% year-over-year in November.
Single-family starts (red) increased in November, and were down 0.7% year-over-year.
The second graph shows single and multi-family housing starts since 1968. 
This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble, and then the eventual recovery (but still not historically high).
Total housing starts in November were above expectations, and starts in September and October were up slightly revised, combined.

Here are the projections.  In September, about half of participants expected one rate hike in 2022.  Now, participants expect 3 rate hikes in 2022.
Wall Street forecasts are for GDP to increase at close to a 6.5% annual rate in Q4 that would put Q4-over-Q4 at around 5.4% - so the FOMC projections for 2021 were revised down.

FOMC Statement: 
The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.
With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but continue to be affected by COVID-19. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial cond…]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
Using the Census Bureau data, we can calculate the impact the number of households needed in the 1970s due to 1) population growth, and 2) changes in household size:
Over those 12 years, the US needed an additional 950 thousand housing units per year due to the changes in household size.  However, the US only needed about 550 thousand housing units per year due to population growth.  Because of the changes in household size, the U.S. needed far more additional housing units in the '70s than in recent years with the number of persons per household relatively stable.
Notes for all tables:
Over the last two years - in 2020 and 2021 - the US needed very few new housing units due to population growth, so the demand for homeownership and rentals must be coming mostly from smaller household size. (NOTE: There was also significant 2nd home buying and other reasons).
Is something similar happening now to household size with the millennials?    It probably is, and unfortunately household data is not timely or reliable.]]></summary>

For manufacturing, the diffusion index was at 67.3, up from 66.7 the previous month.
Think of this as a measure of how widespread job gains or losses are across industries. The further from 50 (above or below), the more widespread the job losses or gains reported by the BLS.  From the BLS:

... today's effective rates were a bit lower versus Friday afternoon.  Improvement mostly followed a bond rally which, in turn, followed weakness in the stock market.  Low volume contributed to the size of the move, which is to say it would have been even smaller during a busier time of the year for financial markets.
Nonetheless, things will probably get fairly busy in the middle of the week after the Federal Reserve releases its new policy statement.  The Fed is expected to announce that it will curtail its rate-friendly bond purchases at a faster pace.  [30 year fixed 3.17%]

경기가 좋을 때든 나쁠 때든 흔들림 없이 ‘인플레이션은 반복된다’는 굳건한 믿음을 갖고 꾸준히 투자하는 사람만이 결국 부자가 될 수 있다. 자본주의 시스템이 지속되는 한 실물자산의 가격은 계속 오를 것. 일시적인 하락을 기다리거나, 폭락을 두려워할 필요가 없다. 인플레이션이 재테크에 주는 영향을 빨리 이해하고 빨리 시작하는 사람만이 조금 더 빨리 부를 이룰 것이다.

주식, 코인보다 무서운 구매력 위험
인플레이션에 올라타면 구매력 위험이 사라진다
지금 당장 풀어야 할 두 가지 과제

3장 부자로 가는 디딤돌, 목돈 마련과 기초 투자법
필요한 자금을 계산해보자
자연스럽게 저축하는 몸을 만들자
많은 돈을 모을 수 있는 골든타임
돈을 모으는 목적은 주택 구입이 아니다
돈을 모으는 동안 공부를 해야 한다
도박과 투자의 차이점은 불확실함의 정도
떠올려보자! 누구에게나 투자 성공 경험이 있다
적립식 펀드로 재밌게 실용적인 공부를 하라
분산투자는 나중에, 지금은 집중하자

4장 MZ세대가 부동산에 투자하는 법
많은 투자 상품 중 무엇부터 공부해야 할까?
소액 아파트 투자, 이렇게 성공했다
부동산 규제 정책이 실패한 이유
주택 공급량에 구매 타이밍이 있다
가격 하락이 예상되더라도 집은 사야 한다
‘영끌’은 감당할 수 있는 수준에서
집값이 영원히 올라갈 수는 없다
내 집을 장만하는 네 가지 방법
청약통장, 미리 준비해두는 게 좋다
집 하나를 구하더라도 입지를 고려해서
재건축과 재개발에 관심을 기울이자

5장 주식으로 인플레이션에 올라타는 방법
안전한 주식 투자를 위한 기본 지식
시가총액 상위 종목의 특징
개별 종목 투자가 어려운 이유
시장에 투자하면 실패하지 않는다
안전하고 유망한 시장은 정해져 있다
주식 투자는 길게 보는 사람이 이긴다
주식 투자의 목적은 어디까지나 목돈 키우기

Excerpt: 
Looks like we will see new record low inventories this winter
...
Here is a summary of active listings for these housing markets in November. Inventory was down 14.7% in November month-over-month (MoM) from October, and down 28.7% year-over-year (YoY).
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in November, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 25.4% YoY, so the YoY decline in November is larger than in October. This isn’t indicating a slowing market..

기본소득은 과연 가능할까. 인공지능과 로봇이 인간의 노동력을 대체할 미래에는 기본소득으로 불평등과 빈곤문제를 해결할 것으로 전망하는 실정이다. 제도의 취지나 당위로는 더할 나위가 없다. 관건은 재원 마련이다. 막대한 돈이 드는 기본소득을 현실로 옮길 수 있을까. 이 책 『모두의 기본소득, 재원을 마련하다』의 저자들은 “기본소득 지급도, 재원조달도 모두 가능하다”고 입을 모은다.

기본소득 재원 마련의 철학적 기초는 ‘공유부’에 있다. 토지, 환경, 지식, 데이터 등 모두에게 속한 공유부의 수익을 평등하게 나눈다는 것이다. 이 책은 기본소득으로 지급할 수 있는 재원으로서, 공유부에 근거해 정당성을 획득한 모든 방안을 다룬다.

기본소득 금액을 먼저 정하고 이에 부합하는 재정모델을 설정한 다음 지급 방안을 마련하는 접근과는 다르다. 조달 가능한 재원을 최대한으로 모색하고 그 규모를 추계해 제시하는 방식이다. 실현가능한 재원조달 방안들과 조달액 추계 범위 내에서 상황에 따라 단계별로 취할 수 있는 조합을 모색하는 데 도움이 된다.

현재 뜨겁게 논쟁이 일고 있는 메타버스에 대한 전반적인 이해를 넘어서 산업 생태계, 관리, 경제학, 기반시설 등 여러 각도에서 생각해 봐야 할 관점을 보여 준다. 저자들은 과거 디지털 경제를 연구하면서 깨달은 바에 과학 기술 분야의 가장 놀랄 만한 변혁을 결합해 향후 발전 방향의 윤곽을 정리했다.

문제는 인류가 앞으로 살아갈 이 디지털 신세계에서는 과거 전통 경제에서 당연하다고 여겨졌던 기본 원칙들이 모두 통하지 않는다는 것이다. 더구나 이 책의 서문을 쓴 이더리움의 창시자 비탈릭 부테린은 메타버스의 디지털 자산 규모가 머지않아 현실 세계의 자산 규모를 넘어설 것이라고 예언한다.

메타버스는 단순한 경제가 아니라 ‘사회’이며 더욱이 M세대(메타버스 세대)가 만든 포스트모던 사회다. 메타버스에는 경제 현상은 물론이고 문화 현상과 사회 현상도 있다. 국가, 민족, 지역, 시간의 경계를 초월한 이 사회는 어떤 문명을 만들어낼까? 이 책은 도래할 메타버스 시대를 준비하고 기회를 포착하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것이다.

블록체인이란 거래정보가 중앙 서버에 집중되지 않고, 네트워크의 여러 컴퓨터에 분산해서 저장되는 것을 말한다. 블록체인 기술에 주목하는 이유는 저렴한 비용으로 투명하고 안전한 전자금융거래가 가능해질 것이라는 기대감 때문이다. 비용 측면에서도 블록체인은 기술의 특성상 막대한 비용절감 효과를 기대할 수 있기에 금융권과 공공서비스 부문의 블록체인 도입은 더욱 활발해질 전망이다.

20세기 가장 위대한 경제학자, 케인스. 그는 경제 이론과 경제 정책에 있어 위대한 지적 혁명을 촉발시켰다. 이 책은 수학 방정식 등을 최소화하면서, 대학교 학부학생, 열린 마음을 가지고 있는 기존 강단 경제학자, 공무원 그리고 일반 경제인 등 다양한 계층의 독자 모두가 쉽게 케인스의 경제 사상을 이해할 수 있도록 설명하고 있다.

이 책은 케인스 이론의 핵심적인 개념들, 즉 시장경제에 있어서 불확실성, 균형의 의미, 화폐의 역할, 그리고 유효수요의 원칙을 설명함으로써, 이러한 핵심 개념을 철저히 무시하고 있는 기존 주류 경제학과 그 안에서의 자칭 케인지언들이 가지는 오류를 지적하고 있다.

또한 그에 비추어 현대 경제에 있어서 다양한 논쟁점들, 즉 고용과 실업의 문제, 재정과 금융 정책, 국제수지 문제 등에 대한 케인스적인 해결 방안을 시사하고 있다. 특히 그러한 논의들을 역사적 배경(베르사유조약부터 브레턴우즈 체제까지)과 연결시키고, 또한 케인스의 경제 이론이 현재의 유로존 문제에 어떤 해결점을 제시할 수 있는지도 검토한다.

지금 우리가 처한 세계를 이해하는 가장 적합한 키워드가 있다면 그것은 ‘불평등’이다. 토마 피케티는 지난 몇십 년 동안 전 세계적으로 소득과 부의 불평등이 증가했다고 말한다. 그의 책 『21세기 자본』이 촉발한 불평등이라는 주제는 경제뿐 아니라 정치, 사회적으로 경각심을 일으키고 커다란 영향을 끼쳤다. 

경제학자 이정우는 피케티의 첫 책과 함께 최근작 『자본과 이데올로기』와 여러 저명한 경제학자가 함께 쓴 『세계불평등보고서 2018』을 통해 피케티가 정확히 어떤 진단을 내리고 있는지 알기 쉽게 설명하고 있다. 또한 불평등 문제를 해소하기 위해 피케티가 제시한 사회국가, 누진소득세, 세계자본세 그리고 참여사회주의와 참여연방주의 등의 처방에 대해서도 살펴본다. 

저자가 피케티의 책을 안내하는 이유는 한국 사회의 불평등을 바로 보고, 그에 따른 대안을 제안하고자 하는 데 있다. 한국은 소득 불평등, 정규직과 비정규직의 양극화, 부동산으로 인한 자산 불평등이 유독 심각하다. 저자는 이 문제의 해결 없이는 한국 경제의 지속적인 발전과 선진국 진입은 어렵다고 말한다. 나아가 한국이 처한 현실을 냉정하게 드러내 보여주고, 더 나은 세상으로 바꿔나가기 위한 다양한 해법들을 제시하고 있다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 ‘테라 인코그니타: 공존을 위한 새로운 시대정신을 찾아’를 아젠다로 제안했다. 한 번도 가보지 않은 새로운 세계는 우리에게 기회가 될 수도, 위협이 될 수도 있다. 하지만 정치.경제.학술.문화 등 각 분야의 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 통해 미래를 예측하고 준비할 수 있다면, 위협 또한 기회로 바꿀 수 있을 것이다.

제22회 세계지식포럼은 현재 우리가 직면한 문제를 ‘정치 변화의 역학 Global Power Dynamics’, ‘비즈니스의 새 정의 New Business Path’, ‘부의 탐색 Wealth Discovery’, ‘넷제로 레이스 Race to Net-zero’, ‘비욘드 그래비티 Beyond Gravity’, ‘새로운 세계로의 입문 Hello, New World’ 등 6개의 대주제로 정하고 이에 대한 글로벌 리더들의 목소리를 들었다.

전자공학과 소프트웨어에 대한 비전공자들도 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 기초적인 파이썬 언어에 대한 내용과 리눅스 기초 명령어들을 습득하고 라즈베리파이 4 실제 보드에서 파이썬을 이용해서 간단한 센서들의 동작 원리를 바로 실습해 볼 수 있도록 하였다. 파이썬 언어 전용으로 집필되었기 때문에 프로그램 언어의 초보자들도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있고, 센서 실습도 복잡한 부품과 브레드보드(일명 빵판)를 사용하지 않고 센서 HAT보드에 연결만 하면 바로 실습이 가능하기 때문에 전자공학 비전문가들도 간단하게 따라 하기가 가능하다. 특히 최근 온라인 비대면 수업을 할 때 배선 오류에 대한 부담감을 줄일 수 있다.

TensorFlow와 sklearn을 사용해 금융이나 경제 맥락에 인공지능을 접목하는 방법론을 설명한다. 먼저 경제학이 추구하는 지향점과 머신러닝의 특징과 장점을 비교해 같은 점과 다른 점을 분석한 다음 양 측면에서 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 방대한 참고문헌과 함께 설명한다. 기초적인 회귀에서 출발해 결정 트리와 랜덤 포레스트를 살펴보고 이미지 처리와 자연어 처리가 금융 맥락에서 어떻게 활발하게 활용되고 있는지 설명한다. 특히 자연어 처리 부분이 금융 맥락과 접목되는 지점은 다양한 실습과 예제를 통해 손쉽게 이해하도록 돕는다.

금융 데이터의 특징인 시계열 데이터는 RNN과 LSTM를 활용해 설명한다. 또한 생성적 모델을 적용하는 방법과 이론적 모델 부분도 다룬다. 각 장은 모두 예제와 코드를 지원하며 이를 통해 각 상황을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 기초를 제공한다. 책에서 제공하는 방대한 참고문헌은 금융 맥락에서 인공지능을 접목하려던 수많은 학자의 발자취를 살펴볼 귀중한 자료다.

니오, 샤오펑, 리오토 등 넥스트 테슬라를 외치는 중국 기업들이 두각을 드러내며 중국을 자동차 후진국에서 모빌리티 강국으로 탈바꿈시키고 있다. 그리고 중국의 거대한 시장 잠재력을 꿰뚫어 본 글로벌 자동차 업체들이 차이나 모빌리티에 올라타기 위해 앞다퉈 투자에 나서고 있다. 과연 미래 모빌리티라는 피할 수 없는 변화의 물결 앞에서 우리는 어떻게 대응해야 할까.

한국은 세계 5위 자동차 생산국이지만, 모빌리티 비즈니스 부문에서는 후발주자에 가깝다. 결국 미래 모빌리티의 핵심 강국으로 떠오르는 차이나 모빌리티에 주목해야 앞으로 생존을 넘어서 100년 만에 찾아온 새로운 모빌리티 시대를 주도할 수 있다. 차이나 모빌리티의 모든 것이 이 책에 담겨 있다.

“수신료의 가치를 증명한 명품 다큐” 등 시청자들의 뜨거운 호평을 받은 2021년 화제의 다큐멘터리 〈팬데믹 머니〉가 책으로 만들어졌다. 2차 세계대전 이후 최악의 실물경제와 최대 호황을 맞이한 자산 시장이 교차하는 이 모순된 현실은 왜 발생하는 걸까? 

그 답을 구하기 위해 〈팬데믹 머니〉 제작진은 제러미 리프킨, 제이슨 솅커, 오건영, 박종훈 등 국내외 최고 경제 전문가들을 만나 달러라는 기축통화가 작동하는 방식부터 어마어마하게 풀린 돈이 거품과 부채를 만들고 결국 경제 위기를 불러일으키는 과정을 깊이 있게 추적한다.

특히 『팬데믹 머니: 감염된 경제, 풀린 돈의 역습에 대비하라』는 방송에서 미처 다 보여주지 못한 전문가들과의 대담을 수록했다. 또한 2022년 달라질 경제 환경과 자산 시장에 대해 통화정책 전문가 김진일 고려대 교수와 금융 전문가 오건영 신한은행 부부장과 이야기를 나눴다.

금리와 환율만 알면 경제 공부 다했다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 그만큼 금리와 환율에는 국내외 경제 상황이 총체적으로 반영되어 있기 때문이다. 금리와 환율이 주가에 미치는 영향이나 상관관계에 따른 책은 많으나, 금리와 환율에만 초점을 맞추며 경제를 풀어내는 책은 찾기 어렵다. 그래서 ‘거시경제의 거장’이라 불리는 김영익 서강대 경제대학원 교수는 『금리와 환율 알고 갑시다』를 통해 어렵고 복잡한 경제이론과 시장의 상황을 낱낱이 분석하여 자신만의 철학으로 쉽게 명쾌하게 풀어낸다. 

지금 우리에게 필요한 것은 단순 금리와 환율의 개념이 아니다. 금리와 환율을 통해 현재의 경제 상황을 이해하고, 미래를 내다볼 수 있는 통찰력을 갖추어 조금 더 명확하게 경제의 흐름을 파악하는 안목이다. 그 깊이 있는 안목은 금리 인상(하락), 환율 변동, 집값 상승(하락) 등의 위기에도 올바른 판단과 실행을 이룰 수 있게 도와줄 것이다.

프롤로그: 금리와 환율 알고 갑시다

제1부 금리 알고 갑시다
금리란 무엇일까요?
• 금리의 기원은 신용에 있습니다
• 경제학 교과서에서는 현재의 소비를 참는 데에 대한 대가를 금리라 합니다
한국은행의 통화정책 수단, 기준금리
• 한국은행의 기준금리는 모든 금리의 기준입니다
• 기준금리는 한국은행 금융통화위원회에서 결정합니다
• 통화정책방향 결정문과 의사록은 꼭 보아야 합니다
• 비둘기파와 매파의 구분은 이렇습니다
• 한국은행은 기준금리를 왜 올리고 내릴까요?
• 기준금리는 어떻게 물가에 영향을 주나요?
• 미국의 기준금리는 연방기금금리 입니다
• 적정 기준금리 수준을 결정하는 하나의 방법이 테일러준칙이라 합니다
금리인상이 가계와 자영업자에 미치는 영향
• 금리인상으로 가계 이자부담금액이 늘어나게 되었습니다
• 금리인상으로 자영업자 부담도 더 늘어납니다
• 금리가 오르면 가계 전체적으로는 이익입니다
단리와 복리
• 저축은 복리로 해야 합니다
• 72법칙을 알아야 합니다
• 중국이 미국 GDP에 접근해가는 것도 복리의 마법에 있습니다
금리와 채권 가격은 역관계
• 금리가 오르면 채권 가격은 떨어집니다
• 채권의 수요와 공급에 따라 가격과 금리가 결정됩니다
• 금리 하락기에 채권투자를 해야 합니다
금리로 미래의 경제를 예측 — 금리의 기간구조 
• 수익률 곡선은 채권만기에 따른 수익률을 연결한 선입니다
• 장단기 금리차이가 선행지수에 앞서갑니다
• 장단기 금리차로 미래의 경제성장률도 예상해볼 수 있습니다
• 장단기 금리차이 역전은 경기침체를 예고합니다
금리로 금융시장 안정성 판단 — 금리의 위험구조
• 금융시장이 불안하면 위험 프리미엄이 확대됩니다
통화와 금리의 관계 
• 통화 공급이 늘어나면 유동성 효과로 금리가 떨어집니다
• 소득효과와 피셔효과로 금리는 다시 상승합니다
예금금리와 대출금리
• 가중평균금리를 보면 금리 추이를 알 수 있습니다
• 한국은행연합회에서 예금과 대출금리를 비교해줍니다
• 첫째, 대출금리가 어떻게 결정되는 건가요?
• 둘째, 대출금리의 종류는 어떤 것들이 있나요?
• 셋째...

지난 2,000년 사이에 지구의 온도는 1도 정도를 오르내리는 선에서 안정적으로 유지되었다. 덕분에 인류는 살아남아 번영을 구가했고 전 세계 인구는 70억까지 늘어났다. 그러나 지금의 세계는 지구온난화로 인한 기상이변으로 돌이킬 수 없는 타격을 입고 있다. 경제적 측면에서도 위기의 상황에 접어들었다. 

이에 저자는 지금 당장 국가, 기업이 탄소 중심의 경제 체제에서 벗어나 재생에너지, 전기자동차 등 저탄소 경제 체제로 변화하지 않으면 미래는 없다고 단언하고 이미 기후위기를 기회로 만드는 국가와 기업들의 사례를 통해 우리에게 나아가야 할 방향을 제시한다.

존 엘킹턴 지음, 정윤미 옮김 / 더난출판사 / 2021년 12월 / ISBN:9788984054202
정가: 17,000원 / 판매가: 15,300원 / 마일리지: 850원
이벤트: 화제의 책+알라딘 사은품(이벤트 도서 포함, 국내도서 4만원 이상)




회복과 재생을 촉진하는 새로운 미래 자본주의 모델 안내서 《그린 스완》이 출간됐다. 그린 스완은 지난 2007년 뉴욕대학교 교수 나심 니콜라스 탈레브가 제시한 용어 ‘블랙 스완’에서 파생했다. 블랙 스완은 가능성이 극히 적지만, 일단 발생하면 돌이킬 수 없을 정도의 엄청난 충격을 주는 사건을 말한다. 9.11 테러나 2008년 세계 금융위기가 그 대표적인 예다. 그린 스완은 ‘해결책’을 더한, ‘자본시장의 변화를 촉진하는 개념’으로 지속가능성 측면에서 새롭게 정의한 미래 자본주의 모델이라고 할 수 있다. 

이 책은 이미 시작된 ‘변화의 징후’를 읽는 10가지 용어인 목적, 비즈니스 모델, 수익, 성장, 가치, 임팩트, 책임, 중대성, 지배구조, 좌초자산을 통해 세계 경제의 패러다임이 바뀌고 있음을 확인한다. 기업에서 전례가 없는 엄청난 사안에 직면하게 될 때, 종종 ‘사악한 문제’가 발생한다. 예를 들면 담배 회사는 흡연이 수많은 질병을 일으킨다는 것을 알면서도 그 문제를 은폐해왔고, 결국 거대한 액수의 벌금을 선고받아야 했다.

저자가 지적하는 사악한 문제는 크게 다섯 가지다. 플라스틱 쓰레기로 오염된 바다, 살인자 칼로리, 항생제가 초래한 슈퍼버그, 탄소가 급격히 기온을 상승시킨 것, 심각하게 증가한 우주 쓰레기다. 책에서는 이를 해결하기 위한 다섯 가지 패러다임을 짚어내고, 그린 스완의 특성을 지닌 자본주의와 민주주의 그리고 지속가능성을 제시한다. 저자는 세계 기업들에 다음과 같이 엄중하게 윤리성을 촉구한다.

‘공정한 보상’의 저자 신재용 교수는 ‘MZ세대에게 ‘공정’이란 노력에 대한 정당한 대가를 의미하는 매우 실용적인 개념’이라고 말한다. 부도 신분도 대물림되는, 별다른 출구가 없는 이 세대가 살아남기 위해 강조하는 레토릭(rhetoric)이 바로 ‘공정’인 것이다. 

MZ세대는 ‘교환(exchange)’이라는 틀로 세상을 본다. 신재용 교수는 이 책에서 화이트칼라 MZ세대의 특수한 성장배경을 분석하며, 학창시절부터 통과의례처럼 거듭한 토너먼트 경쟁 끝에 현재의 직장에 자리한 이들에게 ‘투입한 노력에 상응하는 대가’를 받는 공정한 교환관계를 유지하는 것이야말로 자신을 지키는 일임을 밝힌다.

01 왜 지금 공정한 보상인가?
공정이 최고의 가치다: 공정성에 민감한 MZ세대의 등장
화이트칼라 MZ세대가 생각하는 공정은 다르다
화이트칼라 MZ세대는 왜 공정한 보상에 더 민감한가?
MZ세대의 토너먼트 연대기
더 이상 비밀은 없다-MZ세대의 소속기반 커뮤니티
왜 갑자기 지금? 최근의 성과급 논란
SK하이닉스 성과급 논란: 이천 쌀집에서는 무슨 일이 있었나?
EVA=영업이익-세금-자본비용

02 무엇이 공정한 보상인가?
보상을 보는 두 가지 이론
기본급 결정을 위한 세 가지 실무
한국기업의 성과급: 인재의 영입, 유지, 동기부여의 도구인가?
한국의 MZ세대 직장인들은 보상을 공정하다고 생각할까?
보상은 무엇에 근거해야 하는가?
공정과 “운”의 필터링
글로벌 기업 CEO 보상을 둘러싼 논쟁
[더 알아보기1] 암젠(Amgen)의 CEO 성과보상 사례
[더 알아보기2] 사회적 가치 혹은 사회성과에 근거한 보상
[더 알아보기3] 넷플릭스 드라마 ‘오징어 게임’에서 나오는 게임들 중 가장 공정한 게임은?

03 성과에 근거한 보상: 성과측정과 인센티브 설계
성과목표는 왜 필요할까?
성과지표의 선정
성과-보상 간 민감도 결정

04 임직원 보상격차
우리 사장님은 얼마 받고 일하실까?
나도 언젠가 그 자리에 올라갈 수 있으니까-토너먼트 이론
임원은 직원의 몇 배를 받아야 할까?
토너먼트 이론과 공정성 이론은 공존할 수 있을까?
중요한 것은 승진가능성!
전무, 상무의 동기부여가 직원보다 더 중요하다

05 어디로 나아갈 것인가? 보다 공정한 보상을 위한 제언
MZ세대의 보상에 대한 요구를 이해하고 제도를 정렬하라
집단을 넘어 개인의 성과로: 역량 있는 관리자의 육성부터 시작하자
평가/보상의 투명성이 중요하다
직급 중심에서 역할 중심으로, 획일적인 보상에서 다양한 보상으로
성장할 수 있는 기회도 보상의 일부다

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The competitive impacts of vertical mergers are a long-standing question in antitrust economics. A recent wave of vertical mergers has reinvigorated the academic and policy debate on enforcement, and the discussion is far from settled. An example of this is that US antitrust authorities presented new vertical merger guidelines in 2020, but the Federal Trade […]

파이썬을 마스터할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 연습이다. 숫자 맞히기 게임, 16진수 출력하기와 같은 간단한 문제부터 판매세 계산하기, 순환하는 이터레이터 만들기와 같은 궁금한 문제들까지 프로그래밍 실력을 키워 줄 엄선된 50가지 연습 문제를 담았다. 

먼저 어떤 내용을 다룰지 알아보고, 문제를 제시한 후, 해답과 함께 풀어보며, 어떻게 동작하는지 그리고 추가로 어떤 부분을 고민해볼지도 설명한다. 새로운 문제에 도전할 때마다 프로그래밍 기술과 자신감을 키울 수 있을 것이다. 또한, 이렇게 배운 내용들은 자신의 프로젝트에 적용해볼 수도 있다. 파이썬을 배운 후 어떻게 실력을 키울지 막막하다면 이 책으로 시작해보자.
