From CoStar: STR: US Hotel Occupancy Drops, but Rates Increase Slightly
U.S. hotel occupancy dipped a percentage point week over week, while room rates rose slightly, according to STR‘s latest data through October 23.
October 17-23, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 63.9% (-9.1%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $134.14 (-0.6%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $85.74 (-9.6%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The Summer months had decent occupancy with solid leisure travel, and occupancy was only off about 7% in July and August compared to 2019.


Usually weekly occupancy increases to around 70% in the weeks following Labor Day due to renewed business travel.   However, this year, so far, business travel has been lighter than leisure travel in 2021.]]></summary>

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.0 percent in the third quarter of 2021, according to the "advance" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 6.7 percent.
emphasis added
On a Q3-over-Q3 basis, GDP was up 4.9%.
The advance Q2 GDP report, at 2.0% annualized, was below expectations, due to several factors - a sharp decline in Motor vehicles and parts (due to supply constraints), a decline in residential investment, a decline in government expenditures and a negative contribution from trade.
Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased at a 1.6% annualized rate in Q3, a much slower pace than the previous two quarters.

Pending home sales dipped in September, retreating slightly following a previous month of growth, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Each of the four major U.S. regions saw contract activity decline month-over-month and year-over-year, with the Northeast weathering the largest yearly drop.
The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI), a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, decreased 2.3% to 116.7 in September. Year-over-year, signings decreased 8.0%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
...
Month-over-month, the Northeast PHSI fell 3.2% to 93.1 in September, an 18.5% decline from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index dropped 3.5% to 111.4 last month, down 5.8% from September 2020.
Pending home sales transactions in the South decreased 1.8% to an index of 139.1 in September, down 5.8% from September 2020. The index in the West declined 1.4% in September to 105.3, down 7.2% from a year prior.
emphasis added
This was below expectations of a 0.5% increase for this index.  Note: Contract signings usually lead sales by about 45 to 60 days, so this would usually be for closed sales in October and November.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The headline below "No one seems worried ... Just like last time the bubble burst" applies to government officials in the Bush administration and at the Fed (although there was some concern at the Fed, notably from Dr. Janet Yellen).  Plenty of private forecasters were expressing concern in 2005 like Dean Baker (for example, see my post Speculation is the Key in early 2005).
Chris Isidore writes at CNN: No one seems worried about a housing bubble. Just like last time the bubble burst.

CR take: There is agreement that underwriting standards are much better today than during the bubble (although I'm a little concern about some non-QM loans, and FHA loans are always a little risky - but nothing like the insanity during the housing bubble).  And also, if prices do fall, there is agreement we won't be cascading price declines like during the housing bust.


Here are some interesting quotes from the article: 
"I don't think we'll see prices fall 20% to 30% once again," said Dean Baker, senior economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy and Research. "I don't think there's that kind of story out there." But he cautioned that even a modest rise in interest rates could lead home prices to slide between 5% and 8%.
 And from Mark Zandi: 
"The housing market is out of whack. It's not sustainable. It is overvalued, stretched and vulnerable as [mortgage] rates rise, and affordability gets crushed," he said. "But I'm not concerned we're going to have a crash."
And from Ivy Zelman: 
Zelman doesn't believe there will be another collapse in housing prices like the last time. She said that a rise in the 30-year fixed rate mortgage from the current 2.9% to about 4% could be enough to send prices lower. "A lot of what we're seeing is scary," she said. "We don't know what will happen with interest rates."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using a structural life-cycle model and data on school visits from Safegraph and school closures from Burbio, we quantify the heterogeneous impact of school closures during the Corona crisis on children affected at different ages and coming from households with different parental characteristics. Our data suggests that secondary schools were closed for in-person learning for longer periods than elementary schools (implying that younger children experienced less school closures than older children), and that private schools experienced shorter closures than public schools, and schools in poorer U.S. counties experienced shorter school closures. We then extend the structural life cycle model of private and public schooling investments studied in Fuchs-Schuendeln, Krueger, Ludwig and Popova (2021) to include the choice of parents whether to send their children to private schools, empirically discipline it with data on parental investments from the PSID, and then feed into the model the school closure measures from our empirical analysis to quantify the long-run consequences of the Covid-19 school closures on the cohorts of children currently in school. Future earnings- and welfare losses are largest for children that started public secondary schools at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Comparing children from the top- to children from the bottom quartile of the income distribution, welfare losses are ca. 0.8 percentage points larger for the poorer children if school closures were unrelated to income. Accounting for the longer school closures in richer counties reduces this gap by about 1/3. A policy intervention that extends schools by 3 months (6 weeks in the next two summers) generates significant welfare gains for the children and raises future tax approximately sufficient to pay for the cost of this schooling expansion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the economic consequences of the West’s foray into China after the Opium War (1839-42), when Western colonial influence was introduced in dozens of so-called treaty ports. We document a turnaround during the 19th century in the nature of China’s capital markets. Whereas before the Opium War, coastal cities were of relatively minor importance, the treaty port system of the West transformed China into an economy focused on coastal areas and on international trade that aligned with the trading interests of the West. We show, first, that the West had a positive impact on China’s economy during the 19th century. It brought down local interest rates, and regions under Western influence exhibited both higher rates of industry growth and technology adoption. Second, the geographic scope of influence went far beyond the ports, impacting most of China. Interest rates fell by more than a quarter in the immediate vicinity of the ports and still by almost ten percent at distances of 450 kilometers from treaty ports. The development of China was not simply propelled by its own pre-1800 history, or by post-1978 reforms. The nearly 100 years of semi-colonization have shaped China’s economy today as one focused on the coastal areas.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many governments have engaged in policy experimentation in various forms to resolve uncertainty and facilitate learning. However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China’s policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find three main results. First, more than 80% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality’s economic development, and much of this can be attributed to misaligned incentives across political hierarchies. Second, local politicians allocate more resources to ensure the experiments’ success, and such effort is not replicable when policies roll out to the entire country. Third, the presence of sample selection and strategic effort is not fully accounted for by the central government, thus affecting policy learning and distorting national policies originating from the experimentation. Taken together, these results suggest that while China’s bureaucratic and institutional conditions make policy experimentation at such scale possible, the complex political environments can also limit the scope and bias the direction of policy learning.]]></summary>

A bank is vulnerable to a run when a loss of investors' confidence triggers deposit withdrawals and leads the bank to default on its obligations.  We analytically characterize how the vulnerability of an individual bank depends on macroeconomic aggregates and how the number of banks facing a run affects macroeconomic aggregates in turn. In general equilibrium, runs can be partial or complete, depending on aggregate leverage and the dynamics of asset prices. Our normative analysis shows that the effectiveness of credit easing and its welfare implications depend on whether a financial crisis is driven by fundamentals or by self-fulfilling runs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract We evaluate the duration of the China trade shock and its impact on a wide range of outcomes over the period 2000 to 2019. The shock plateaued in 2010, enabling analysis of its effects for nearly a decade past its culmination. Adverse impacts of import competition on manufacturing employment, overall employment-population ratios, and income per capita in more trade-exposed U.S. commuting zones are present out to 2019. Over the full study period, greater import competition implies a reduction in the manufacturing employment-population ratio of 1.54 percentage points, which is 55% of the observed change in the value, and the absorption of 86% of this net job loss via a corresponding decrease in the overall employment rate. Reductions in population headcounts, which indicate net out-migration, register only for foreign-born workers and the native-born 25-39 years old, implying that exit from work is a primary means of adjustment to trade-induced contractions in labor demand. More negatively affected regions see modest increases in the uptake of government transfers, but these transfers primarily take the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Adverse outcomes are more acute in regions that initially had fewer college-educated workers and were more industrially specialized. Impacts are qualitatively—but not quantitatively—similar to those caused by the decline of employment in coal production since the 1980s, indicating that the China trade shock holds lessons for other episodes of localized job loss. Import competition from China induced changes in income per capita across local labor markets that are much larger than the spatial heterogeneity of income effects predicted by standard quantitative trade models. Even using higher-end estimates of the consumer benefits of rising trade with China, a substantial fraction of commuting zones appears to have suffered absolute declines in average real incomes.]]></summary>

Using data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we document striking similarities in spatial differences in unemployment, vacancies, job finding, and job filling within each country.

We find that a spatial version of a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with endogenous separations and on-the-job search quantitatively accounts for all the documented empirical regularities. The model also quantitatively rationalizes why differences in job-separation rates have primary importance in inducing differences in unemployment across space while changes in the job-finding rate are the main driver in unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the role and incidence of entry preemption strategic motives on the dynamics of new industries, while providing an empirical test for entry preemption, and quantifying its impact on market structure. The empirical context is the evolution of the U.S. drive-in theater market between 1945 and 1957. We exploit a robust prediction of dynamic entry games to test for preemption incentives: the deterrence effect of entering early is only relevant for firms in markets of intermediate size. Potential entrants in small and large markets face little uncertainty about the actual number of firms that will eventually enter. This leads to a non-monotonic relationship between market size and the probability of observing an early entrant. We find robust empirical support for this prediction using a large cross-section of markets. We then estimate the parameters of a dynamic entry game that matches the reduced-form prediction and quantify the strength of the preemption incentive. Our counterfactual analysis shows that strategic motives can increase the number of early entrants by as much as 50 percent in mid-size markets without affecting the number of firms in the long run. By causing firms to enter the market too early, we show that strategic entry preemption leads on average to a 5% increase in entry costs and a 1% decrease in firms' expected value (relative to an environment without strategic investments).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Socioeconomic inequalities in child development crystallize at early stages, with associated disparities in parental investment in children. A key to understanding the data patterns is to document the sources underlying the observed inequalities. We first show that there are dramatic differences in parental beliefs across socioeconomic backgrounds (SES), with parents of higher SES being more likely to believe that parental investments impact child development. We then use two field experiments targeted to low-SES families to explore the mutability of such beliefs and their link to parental investments. In both cases, we find that parental beliefs about child development are malleable. The less intensive version of the program based on educational videos changes parental beliefs, but fails to lastingly increase parental investments and child outcomes. By contrast, in the more intensive version of our program combining home visits and feedback, the augmented beliefs are associated with enriched parent-child interactions and improved vocabulary, math, and social-emotional skills for the children. Together, these results suggest that changing parental beliefs can be an important pathway to raising parental investments and reducing socioeconomic gaps in children’s skills, but that simple informational policies may not be sufficient.]]></summary>

For households in zip codes with higher exposure, the decline is as high as $39 per month, or 19 percent. We also show evidence that the composition of food purchases changes, with low income households experiencing an increase in the dietary quality of their food purchases by about 3 percent after CEP. Finally, we show CEP exposure is associated with an 11 percent decline in the percent of households that ran short of money or tried to make their food money go further, and an almost 5 percent decline in households classified as food insecure. Our results on the heterogeneous effects of CEP exposure by prior free/reduced price lunch eligibility reveal large benefits in terms of both spending, dietary composition, and food insecurity for previously eligible low-income families, suggesting that the stigma of free school meals may be declining after universal access.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two hallmarks of U.S. monetary policy since the 1981-1982 recession have been declining interest rates and moderation in inflation. Coincident with these trends has been a surge in U.S. wealth inequality, with the Gini coefficient up by 0.070 between 1983 and 2019. This paper analyzes the connection between these two developments on the basis of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Contrary to expectations, the paper finds that these two monetary effects have reduced wealth inequality rather than increasing it. The effect is sizeable, with the Gini coefficient declining by 0.045 over these years. Asset price changes and debt devaluation accounted for 72.6 percent of the advance of mean wealth over 1983-2019. They also would have led to a 204.9 percent gain in median wealth, compared to the actual rise of 23.4 percent. Moreover, they have helped lower the racial wealth gap rather than enlarging it. These results are at odds with previous literature in which estimates range from a weak negative effect on inequality to neutral, small positive, and strong positive. In terms of methodology, this paper differs from previous work by focusing on only the direct effects of interest rate changes and inflation on the household balance sheet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To what extent did an expansion and contraction of credit drive the 2000s housing boom and bust? The existing literature lacks consensus, with findings ranging from credit having no effect to credit driving most of the house price cycle. We show that the key difference behind these disparate results is the extent to which credit insensitive agents such as landlords and unconstrained savers absorb credit-driven demand, which depends on the degree of segmentation in housing markets. We develop a model with frictional rental markets that allows us to consider cases in between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically assumed in the literature. We argue that the relative elasticities of the price-rent ratio and homeownership with respect to an identified credit shock is a sufficient statistic to measure the degree of segmentation. We estimate this moment using three different credit supply instruments and use it to calibrate our model. Our results reveal that rental markets are highly frictional and closer to fully segmented, which implies large effects of credit on house prices. In particular, changes to credit standards can explain between 34% and 55% of the rise in price-rent ratios over the boom.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We find that sin good purchases are highly concentrated with 10% of households paying more than 80% of taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. Total sin tax burdens are poorly explained by demographics (including income), but are well explained by eight household clusters defined by purchasing patterns. The two most taxed clusters comprise 8% of households, pay 68% of sin taxes, are older, less educated, and lower income. Taxes on sugary beverages broaden the tax base but add to the burdens of heavily taxed households. Efforts to increase sin taxes should consider the heavy burdens borne by few households.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From 2011 to 2014, the Brazilian government conducted a heavily advertised major credit expansion program through government banks as part of its effort to stimulate the economy. Using administrative data on individual-level borrowing and spending, we find that the program led to a substantial rise in borrowing by government employees, especially those with low financial literacy. We trace the impact of credit stimulus on borrowers' consumption through the 2011-16 business cycle, and find that the credit stimulus resulted in higher consumption volatility and lower average consumption over the cycle. Our results suggest a potential downside of using household credit as stimulus in emerging markets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. state pensions are underfunded by trillions of dollars, but their economic burden is unclear. In a model of inefficient taxation, real estate fully reflects the cost of pension shortfalls when it is the only form of immobile capital. We study the effect of pension shortfalls on real estate values at state borders, where labor and physical capital could more easily relocate to a state with a smaller shortfall. Using plausibly exogenous variation driven by pension asset returns, we find that one dollar of pension underfunding reduces house prices near state borders by approximately two dollars. Our estimates imply a deadweight loss associated with addressing pension shortfalls that is consistent with prior research in settings with high returns to public spending and costs of taxation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We estimate the likelihood of financial distress of U.S. hospitals in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic using AHA Annual Survey data for 2011-2019 and smartphone mobility data for 2020. We find that while the average likelihood of distress across all hospitals is 28.53 % in 2020, slightly increasing from 2019, for-profit hospitals are much more likely to be distressed. Their average likelihood of financial distress is 39.13 %---a 6.93 percentage point increase from 2019. For-profit hospitals are the main providers of specialty health care services, such as psychiatric and acute long-term care, so their increased likelihood of distress poses a risk to service provision in these specialty areas, and particularly in rural communities. Our prediction model based on mobility data performs very well in sample against actual data and can potentially help policymakers and hospital administrators to monitor financial distress in real-time when case mixes change, or other large shocks materialize.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We document that nearly half of the global decline in agricultural employment during the 20th-century was driven by new cohorts entering the labor market. A newly compiled dataset of policy reforms supports an interpretation of these cohort effects as human capital. Through the lens of a model of frictional labor reallocation, we conclude that human capital growth, both as a mediating factor and as an independent driver, led to a sharp decline in the agricultural labor supply. This decline accounts, at fixed prices, for 40% of the decrease in agricultural employment. This aggregate effect is roughly halved in general equilibrium.]]></summary>

The Market Tightness Index decreased from 96 to 82 – indicating further tightening in market conditions (any reading above 50 indicates tighter conditions).

Even though the index declined in October, this indicates market conditions tightened further in October, after being especially weak during the early months of the pandemic.

71% of respondents said their markets were tighter (lower vacancy / higher rents) than 3 months ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Case-Shiller house price indexes for August were released this morning.   Zillow forecasts Case-Shiller a month early, and I like to check the Zillow forecasts since they have been pretty close.
From Zillow Research: August 2021 Case-Shiller Results & Forecast: Beginning to Ease Off the Gas
House price growth through August sustained July’s unprecedented velocity, but autumn’s reports indicate that the market is easing off the gas pedal.
...
Compared to August, homes took a little bit longer to sell in September and the for-sale inventory inched higher. In other words, though extraordinary market conditions pushed house prices skyward between the Spring of 2020 and the Summer of 2021, the latest signs indicate that the market is relenting. And while house price appreciation will remain elevated for the next several months, further acceleration is unlikely.
Monthly growth in September as reported by Case-Shiller is expected to accelerate from August in both the 10- and 20-city indices, and slow in the national index. Annual growth in September is expected to accelerate in the 20-city and national index, and slow in the 10-city index. S&P Dow Jones Indices is expected to release data for the September S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices on Tuesday, November 30.
emphasis added
The Zillow forecast is for the year-over-year change for the Case-Shiller National index to be at 20.2% in September, up from 19.8% in August.]]></summary>

Excerpt (there is much more): 
 Here is a graph of the month-over-month (MoM) change in the Case-Shiller National Index Seasonally Adjusted (SA).
The MoM increase in Case-Shiller was at 1.43%; still historically high, but lower than the previous five months. House prices started increasing sharply in the Case-Shiller index in August 2020, so the last 13 months have all been historically very strong, but the peak MoM growth is behind us.

The previous three months were revised down significantly. 
Sales of new single‐family houses in September 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is 14.0 percent above the revised August rate of 702,000, but is 17.6 percent below the September 2020 estimate of 971,000

The first graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions since 1963. The dashed line is the current sales rate.
New home sales are now declining year-over-year since sales soared following the first few months of the pandemic.
The second graph shows New Home Months of Supply.
The months of supply decreased in September to 5.7 months from 6.5 months in August. 
The all time record high was 12.1 months of supply in January 2009.  The all time record low was 3.5 months, most recently in October 2020.
This is in the normal range (about 4 to 6 months supply is normal).
"The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 379,000.  This represents a supply of 5.7 months at the current sales rate"
The last graph shows sales NSA (monthly sales, not seasonally adjusted annual rate).
In September 2021 (red column), 65 thousand new homes were sold (NSA).  Last year, 77 thousand homes were sold in September.
The all time high for September was 99 thousand in 2005, and the all time low for September was 24 thousand in 2011.
This was above expectations of 760 thousand SAAR, however sales in the three previous months were revised down significantly.  I'll have more later today.]]></summary>

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.

영국의 경제사학자이자 『존 메이너드 케인스』 전기 3부작으로 세계적 명성을 얻은 원로 경제 석학 로버트 스키델스키 교수의 최신 화제작. 2008년 글로벌 금융 위기 예측 실패 이후 별다른 진보를 보이지 못한 ‘주류 경제학(신고전주의 경제학)’의 문제점을 총체적으로 진단하고 처방을 모색한다. 모두 13개 장을 할애해 ‘방법론적 결함’에서 ‘학문적 불완전성’까지 치밀하게 살핀다. 비판의 강도가 높고 범위도 넓다.

이 책에서 스키델스키 교수는 작심하고 주류 경제학을 공격하지만, 그 의도는 경제학을 향한 깊은 믿음과 기대에 있다. 그가 보기에 경제학이야말로 인류에게 ‘더 나은 삶’을 열어줄 수 있는 가장 강력하고 현실적인 학문이기 때문이다. 그는 경제학 본연의 역할을 되찾아주고자 이 책을 썼다.

세계 제일의 케인스 전문가라는 타이틀 탓에 ‘케인스주의’로의 회귀를 주장할 것 같지만 그렇지 않고, 주류 경제학을 공격한다고 해서 비주류 경제학을 옹호하는 것도 아니다. 저자는 ‘신고전주의’가 경제학의 주류가 된 배경을 명확히 인지하되, 그 속의 심각한 결함을 바로잡아야 ‘더 나은 삶을 위한 경제학’으로의 대전환을 이룰 수 있다고 역설한다.

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.

Mortgage rates began the day right in line with Friday afternoon's latest levels.  Lenders likely would have been able to offer lower rates if the bond market hadn't begun the day at weaker levels (bond market weakness = higher rates, all other things being equal).  As the day progressed, bonds improved enough for most lenders to make positive adjustments.  The so-called mid-day reprices left the average lender in just slightly better shape on the day.

• At 9:00 AM ET, S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for August.  The consensus is for the Composite 20 index to be up 20.1% year-over-year.
• Also at 9:00 AM, FHFA House Price Index for August. This was originally a GSE only repeat sales, however there is also an expanded index.
• At 10:00 AM, New Home Sales for September from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for 760 thousand SAAR, up from 740 thousand in August.

서울대 비교경제연구센터와 경제추격연구소에서 매년 발행하는 《2022 한국경제 대전망》이 출간되었다. 서울대학교 경제학부 교수이자 국민경제자문회의 부의장인 이근 교수를 위시하여 총 26명의 경제전문가들이 분야별 산업별 국내외 이슈를 통해 우리나라 경제를 거시적으로 조망해보는 미래예측서이다.

올해 우리나라 경제는 여러 가지 중대한 진퇴양난 상황에 부딪쳤다. 대외적으로는 미국과 중국 사이에서 균형 있는 선택이 필요했다. 미·중 모두와 긴밀한 관계를 맺고 있는 한국은 미국에 섣불리 동조하기도, 여전히 성장하는 중국 시장을 무시하기도 어려웠다. 대내적으로는 코로나19 위기에 대응하기 위해 정부 재정 지출을 확충하면서 증가하는 국가부채를 고려해야 했다.

2022년 한국경제는 ‘합종연횡’이라는 키워드 아래 코로나19 경제위기에서의 탈출이라는 큰 흐름을 이어나갈 전망이다. 미·중의 통상 갈등 문제는 바이든 정부 출범 후 처음 열린 G7 정상회의에서 서방의 중국 견제가 공고화되면서 새 전기를 맞았다. 대중국 견제가 강화되면 미중 사이 디커플링이 심화되면서, 그동안 중국과의 강력한 경쟁 압력에 직면해왔던 한국 기업은 도약의 기회를 맞이할 수 있다.

2021년 노벨 경제학상은 ‘최저임금과 실업률’ 간의 기존 통념이 잘못됐음을 입증한 실증경제학자 데이비드 카드 교수에게 수여됐다. 돌아보면 1968년에 노벨 경제학상이 생겨난 후 수십 년 동안은 거의 수학 이론의 차지였다. 그러나 2008년을 기점으로 비수학적 모델에 경제학상을 수여하는 사례가 늘고 있다.

세상이 점점 더 복잡해지고 시장의 불확실성 또한 커지면서 기존의 경제학 이론으로는 설명할 수 없는 현상들이 등장하고 있기 때문이다. 하지만 여느 학문이 그러하듯이 행동경제학이나 진화경제학 등 새로운 경제학 이론 모델도 이전의 경제학자들이 만들어놓은 토대 위에서 발전해온 것이다.

이 책은 경제학의 300년 역사를 선택 이론을 중심으로 펼쳐내며 새로운 서사를 제안한다. 그 서사의 축은 위험과 불확실성 그리고 인간(더 정확히는 인간의 욕망)이다. 그에 따라 경제적 의사결정에 가장 기본적 척도인 효용(재화나 용역에 대한 주관적인 만족의 정도) 이론을 태동시킨 수학자들(니콜라스 베르누이, 다니엘 베르누이, 레몽 드 몽모르, 가브리엘 크라메르)과 존 로크, 제러미 벤담 등 사상가들부터 ‘한계효용체감의 법칙’의 3인방(윌리엄 스탠리 제번스, 레옹 발라, 카를 멩거), ‘게임 이론’의 창시자 존 폰 노이만, 시카고학파의 시조 밀턴 프…]]></summary>

This is partly the result of central governments having provided substantial fiscal support, while at the same time subnational governments have relied heavily on relatively stable revenues from recurrent taxes on immovable property which, unlike in the previous crisis, are not expected to decline due to a housing market crash.]]></summary>

This column explores how the location of oil reserves can affect the likelihood of a particular tension descending into widespread civil violence or war. Using a Norwegian data set, the authors show that the presence of onshore oil has a greater effect than offshore oil in driving conflict. Where a resource is relatively straightforward to access (i.e. on land as opposed to out at sea), rebel groups will be more easily able to reap the benefits of taking control through violence.]]></summary>

투자에 실패한 사람들은 정부 탓, 사회 탓을 한다. 자신의 욕망과 무지를 자책하는 사람은 없다. 투자 수익을 올릴 땐 자신의 능력이고, 손실을 보면 금융감독원이 세금만 받아먹고 하는 일이 없어서 그렇다고 말한다.

 『금융시장의 포식자들』은 때로 아플 정도로 시장경제의 민낯에 대해 얘기한다. 금융시장에서 포식자로 자리잡은 대기업, 최대주주, 기관, 글로벌 기업, 이웃나라인 일본과 중국에 대해 그동안 우리는 잘못된 시각을 지니고 있었다.

대기업 승계와 지배구조 개편 이면의 돈의 흐름, 글로벌 기업들의 한계와 솔루션, 지정학적으로 밀접한 관계를 맺고 있는 일본과 중국의 경제에 대한 냉혹한 판단까지 금융시장을 이끌어가는 포식자들의 면면을 통렬히 해부하고 있다. 이 책의 핵심 메시지는 이렇다. 돈을 벌기 위해서라면 그동안 낡은 피식자의 프레임을 벗어 던지고 포식자의 논리를 깨달아야 한다고 말이다.

프롤로그 _시장에 대해서는 낙관하되 현실에서는 냉철해져라

포식자 마인드 체크포인트

첫 번째 포식자, 대기업
당신이 삼성을 보는 시각은 틀렸다
재벌 개혁? 웃기지 마. 목적은 돈이잖아
SK의 미래가 SK하이닉스인 이유
삼성물산과 제일모직의 합병, 한국인으로서 부끄럽다?
전문 경영인은 연봉을 위해 일한다
가난한 사람은 절대 모르는 부자의 고통
작가의 직설 / 엘시티는 죄가 없다 _엘시티 소유주의 고백
분식회계 좀 했는데 왜요? 그게 뭐 잘못인가요?
전문 경영인과 오너 경영인, 누가 옳은가?
대기업 총수 절반이 범법자인 나라, 정상입니까?
작가의 직설 / 라이벌 LG화학과 SK이노베이션의 쌍둥이 같은 물적 분할

포식자 행세하는 피식자, 노조
대체 가능한 인력일수록 노조에 목을 맨다
애플, 테슬라, 구글, 페이스북은 왜 노조를 싫어할까?
희망 없는 도요타의 미래가 일본의 미래다
투자자 노후는 불안한데 노조는 착실히 밥그릇을 챙긴다
기업의 가장 큰 죄는 부도덕이 아니라 이윤을 못 내는 것이다
노조가 없는 산업은 대체 불가한 미래 산업이다
작가의 직설 / 링컨은 노예를 해방할 생각이 없었다

두 번째 포식자, 기관
단타 치는 기관 관계자들이 왜 밖에서는 장기 투자를 추천할까?
ESG는 미래가 아니라 지독한 이기주의다
작가의 직설 / 힘없는 피식자가 공정을 부르짖는다

세 번째 포식자, 글로벌 기업
테슬라교 교주 일론 머스크가 바라는 건 믿음이 아니라 헌금이다
노조가 없어서 발전한 테슬라, 노조가 없어서 망한다
포식자들은 신화 너머의 추락을 늘 염두에 두고 있다
아마존은 내려갈 일만 남았다
시장의 한계를 인지한 상상력이 돈이 된다
작가의 직설 / 스파에서 대기업 부회장을 마주치다

네 번째 포식자, 이웃나라 일본과 중국
일본 산업은 외래종 유입을 반대하는 섬에 갇혔다
세계 1등이라서 쓰러질 수밖에 없는 시총 1위 도요타
욕망이 없으면 부의 전환도 없다
피로 얻은 건 빼앗기지 않는다
일본 정치인, 너 이름이 뭐니?
일본을 기다리는 건 디폴트의 늪이다
한국을 미워하는 건 일본이 열등하다는 증거다

Freddie's serious delinquency rate peaked in February 2010 at 4.20% following the housing bubble, and peaked at 3.17% in August 2020 during the pandemic.
These are mortgage loans that are "three monthly payments or more past due or in foreclosure".

Mortgages in forbearance are being counted as delinquent in this monthly report, but they will not be reported to the credit bureaus.
This is very different from the increase in delinquencies following the housing bubble.   Lending standards have been fairly solid over the last decade, and most of these homeowners have equity in their homes - and they will be able to restructure their loans once (if) they are employed.
Also - for multifamily - delinquencies were at 0.12%, unchanged from 0.12% in August, and down from the peak of 0.20% in April 2021.]]></summary>

For the economy, what I focus on is single family starts and new home sales.   For the bottoms and troughs for key housing activity, here is a graph of Single family housing starts, New Home Sales, and Residential Investment (RI) as a percent of GDP.

This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of October 22nd, inventory was at 423 thousand (7 day average), compared to 550 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 23.1%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 54.5% from 929 thousand.  A week ago, inventory was at 424 thousand, and was down 23.6% YoY.   


Seasonally, inventory bottomed in April (usually inventory bottoms in January or February). Inventory was about 38% above the record low in early April.


Now inventory may have peaked for the year in early September.   Seven weeks ago inventory was at 437 thousand (the peak for the year so far), so inventory is currently off about 3.3% from the peak for the year.  


Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.

투자에 성공한 수많은 사람의 필승 전략이 책, 유튜브에 넘쳐나는 지금도 여전히 실패하는 사람이 많은 이유는 무엇일까? 그 이유는 투자에 정답이 없기 때문이다. 무조건 성공한다는 비법도 개개인이 처한 상황과 심리에 따라 수익률이 천차만별로 달라진다. 투자의 원리, 자산배분과 장기투자의 이유를 스스로 이해하고 체득하지 않는 이상, 수익은 운으로 잠깐 얻는 것일 뿐 평생 불안하고 초조한 투자를 이어갈 수밖에 없다.

『사경인의 친절한 투자 과외』는 금융&증권 업계의 스타 강사 사경인이 사랑하는 가족에게 직접 전한 8번의 투자 강의를 엮은 책이다. 여의도 증권인이 아닌 코스피, 코스닥도 모르는 왕초보 아내의 눈높이에 맞춰 차근차근 풀어낸 친절한 이 책에는 사랑하는 가족이 누구보다 안정적이고, 현명한 투자를 하길 바라는 사경인 회계사의 진심이 담겨 있다.

프롤로그 내가 없어도 투자를 이어갈 당신을 위해

오리엔테이션 아내는 왜 주식투자가 배우고 싶어졌을까?
여보, 나도 주식 좀 가르쳐줘
1:1 원격 강의를 시작하다
투자의 단계와 방법은 다양하다! 하지만 투자를 잘하기 위해서는 많은 공부가 필요하다
투자에 사용하는 평균부터 다시 배우자
이지영의 생각 내가 잘 배울 수 있을까?
사경인의 생각 버핏은 왜 아내에게 자신의 유산을 인덱스펀드에 맡기라고 했을까?
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 주식투자 전 마음 다잡기

1일차 주식과 부동산, 뭐가 더 좋을까?
강남 아파트 대신 삼성전자 샀으면, 타워팰리스가 3채?
우량주를 사서 장기투자하라는 미신
사례가 아닌 통계를 봐라
코스피지수와 아파트가격지수를 비교해 보자
다 더해서 나누는 산술평균, 다 곱해서 나누는 기하평균
더하기 평균의 단리수익률과 곱하기 평균의 복리수익률
자료의 둔갑술에 속지 마라
주식과 부동산, 180번의 진검승부
하지만 이겨도 이긴 게 아니다
수익률만 쫓다 놓치게 되는 중요한 한 가지 
이지영의 생각 걱정보다는 훨씬 재미있고, 이해가 쉽네
사경인의 생각 사례와 통계를 구분하는 습관이 필요하다 
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 과거와 지금의 수익률을 비교해 보자

2일차 투자의 가성비를 따져보자
가격의 변동성은 왜 위험이 될까?
투자할 때 겪는 마음고생을 가늠하는 지표
가격지수의 상승률만 비교해서는 안 된다
주식보다 부동산이 낫다! 하지만…… 
나눠서 투자하면 좋은 수학적인 이유
돈을 나누는 것과 시간을 나누는 것의 차이
거꾸로 하는 잘못된 투자
손실게임을 수익게임으로 바꾸는 도박사의 공식
고수와 똑같이 투자해도 나만 손해가 나는 이유
자산배분이 먼저다
이지영의 생각 조급해하지 말고, 하나씩 천천히 배워가자
사경인의 생각 도박과 투자는 한 끗 차이
보충수업 투자 성과를 비교하는 다양한 지표들 
실전! 나의 첫 투자 숙제 직접 MDD를 계산해 보자

3일차 자산배분, 어떻게 할 것인가?
얼마까지의 MDD를 견뎌낼 수 있는가?
큰 욕심 안 부리고 1년에 20% 수익만 내고 싶다?
복리라면 5%도 결코 나쁘지 않다

제1차 세계 대전이 시작될 무렵, 어느 한 젊은 학자가 사이드카가 달린 오토바이를 타고 런던으로 떠났다. 당시 잉글랜드에는 역사상 가장 지독한 금융 위기가 터진 지 5일 째가 되는 날이었고, 유럽을 휩쓸어버린 전쟁이 본격적으로 시작되는 시기였다. 영국은 전쟁과 경제 위기로 촉발된 공포와 혼란으로 가득했다. 

젊은 학자는 이러한 위기와 혼란을 잠재울 수 있는 획기적인 방법을 제안하였다. 영국은 젊은 학자의 제안을 받아들였고, 긴박한 위기 상황에서 벗어날 수 있었다. 런던을 위기에서 탈출하게 만든 젊은 학자는 바로 존 메이너드 케인스였다. 그는 이 사건을 통해 무명의 학자에서 당대 가장 영향력 있는 지식인으로 자리 잡을 수 있었다.

베테랑 저널리스트 재커리 D. 카터는 그의 첫 번째 책에서 존 메이너드 케인스의 개인적인 삶과 학문적, 문화적, 정치적 활동을 절묘하게 엮어낸다. 흔히 케인스는 뛰어난 경제학자로만 알려져 있다. 그러나 카터는 케인스가 탁월한 반권위주의 사상가였으며, 예술과 사상이 전쟁과 결핍을 정복할 수 있다는 믿음에 평생을 바쳤던 인물이었음을 그의 생애를 통해 소개한다. 

도덕 철학자, 정치 이론가, 정치가이기도 했던 케인스는 예술가와 지성인의 안식처인 런던 블룸즈버리 그룹에서부터 유럽과 미국 두 대륙의 주식 시장 붕괴, 뉴햄프셔 브레튼우즈에서의 협상, 런던의 호화로운 코벤트 가든에서 열린 발레 공연, 베르사유 조약이 이루어진 파리 회의에 이르기까지 다양한 역사적 순간에서 두각을 나타냈다. 이처럼 카터는 케인스의 다채로운 면모를 보여주면서 단순히 경제학자로 국한될 인물이 결코 아니라는 사실을 깨닫게 한다.

동시대 디지털 기술세계의 확대에 의해 파생되는 ‘피지털’계의 등장을 주목한다. ‘피지털’은 ‘피지컬’과 ‘디지털’을 합친 조어로, 두 공간 지각이 뒤섞인 혼합 현실을 지칭한다. 『피지털 커먼즈』는 거의 모든 유무형 자원을 포획하고 뭇 생명을 예속화하려는 플랫폼자본주의의 인클로저 질서에 맞서서 지속가능한 공통의 미래 대안을 찾기 위한 시도이다. 현실과 가상의 경계가 무너지는 ‘피지털’ 현실에서 우리는 어떤 호혜의 공통장을 기획할 수 있을까? 

오늘날 플랫폼자본주의는 디지털계의 기술 논리를 갖고 물질계의 지형과 배치를 좌우하는 역전된 현실을 만들어내고 있다. 우리 사회가 ‘메타버스’에 바치는 숭고와 찬양은 플랫폼 자본이 주도할 피지털계의 인클로저를 알리는 서곡에 해당한다. 이 책은 피지털계의 자본주의적 왜곡을 경고한다. 인간 삶의 조건을 위협하는 이 플랫폼 인클로저 질서를 넘어설 수 있을까? 

이 책은 플랫폼 질서에 맞서 다른 삶의 직조를 위해 그리고 대안 실천의 무기력을 깨우기 위한 방법으로서 ‘커먼즈’(공통장) 운동을 제안한다. ‘인류세’ 국면 인간-기술-생태의 앙상블을 도모하기 위한 전제 조건은 무엇인가? ‘인류세’ 국면 생태 커먼즈의 구성 논의는 동시대 가장 화급한 쟁점이다. 특히 『피지털 커먼즈』는 생태 커먼즈의 구성에 있어서 인간 기술과 뭇 생명과의 공존 문제를…]]></summary>

However, there is also a risk of inflation remaining persistently high for longer. This column discusses the implications of such a contingency for central banks and monetary policy. The authors warn that sudden policy reversals could lead to severe downturns in financial markets and significantly damage public sector balance sheets. Instead, they call on central banks to develop concrete plans for dealing with persistently higher inflation, with a particular focus on their balance sheet policies in a world of rising nominal interest rates.]]></summary>

This column presents a policy triangle that highlights the trade-offs between three objectives: financial stability, competition, and data privacy. Handling these challenges requires more coordination on rules and standards, both between domestic authorities and across international borders.]]></summary>

Over the past 30 days, interest rates have risen sharply. This is true for both mortgage rates and bond market benchmarks like 10yr Treasury yields. ...
Translation: at the beginning of the month, traders only saw a small chance of the first rate hike happening in September and no chance for June.  Fast forward 3 weeks and September is seen as 100% likely and June is up to about a 60% chance. [30 year fixed 3.27%]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of October 19th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearance Declines Hit Mid-Month Lull
After two weeks of sizable drops in the number of active forbearance plans (as hundreds of thousands of homeowners reached the end of their allowable terms), we saw much more modest improvement this week – the same mid-month lull in removal activity that we’ve been reporting on for many months now.
According to our McDash Flash daily forbearance tracking dataset, the number of active forbearance plans fell by just 7,300 (-0.6%) this week, with declines of 10,500 among FHA/VA loans and 2,800 among GSE mortgages being partially offset by a 6,000 rise in plan volumes among portfolio and PLS mortgages. That’s substantially less than last week’s 143,000 (10%) drop.
As of October 19, 1.24 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 2.3% of all active mortgages, including 1.3% of GSE, 3.9% of FHA/VA and 3% of portfolio held and privately securitized loans.

  Still, on a monthly basis, improvement remains strong, with forbearances declining by 356,000 (-22.3%) over the past 30 days, and the past few weeks have seen the fastest monthly rates of improvement since the start of the pandemic.
Some 432,000 homeowners left forbearance in the first 19 days of October, making it the largest single month in terms of exit volumes since October of last year. And with more than 280,000 plans still up for review through the end of October, significant opportunity remains for additional declines through the first few weeks of November.

변화하는 국제 정세 속에서 새로운 중심지로 떠오른 동북아시아의 대표 국가 남북중의 관계에 대해 다루고, 나아가 동북아의 밝은 미래를 위한 남북중의 협력 방안을 모색한다.

1997년의 아시아 외환위기 이후 2000년대에 동아시아 지역주의의 움직임이 활성화되어 많은 역내 정책 협력이 추진되었다. 하지만 현재 동북아시아는 미중 전략 경쟁, 급변하는 남북관계, 코로나19로 인한 보건 위기 등 다양한 위기 상황에 놓여 있다. 

미중 전략경쟁은 지금부터 시작이고 보건 위기는 언젠가 해소될 가능성이 높지만, 당분간은 교류협력이 어려운 것이 현실이다. 이렇듯 침체된 국제 분위기 속이기에 더욱, 변화하는 현실 속에서 남북중이 교류와 협력을 통해 보다 상호이익의 관계로 한 발짝 더 다가갈 수 있도록 만들 논의가 필요하다.

이에 한반도 문제를 포함한 동북아 정세에 대한 공통의 관심을 가지고 그간 부산과 창춘에서 공동으로 한중 동북아지역 협력세미나를 주최해온 동서대학교 동아시아연구원 중국연구센터와 지린대학교 동북아연구원은 협력 5주년을 기념하여 이 책을 발간하고, 이를 통해 남북중 3자 협력의 초석을 마련하고자 한다.

도시재생의 성공적인 사례와 방법론이 넘치는 가운데 사업이 종료된 이후의 지속가능성을 고민하고 해결책을 제시한 책이 나왔다. 도시재생 현장에서 현실적인 문제를 접해온 저자들이 도시재생사업이 종료된 이후에도 지역경제를 이끌어갈 방법을 모색한 책이다. 저자들은 재개발, 개건축과는 달리 쇠퇴한 지역을 주민들이 주도해 문제를 해결하고 경제 활성화를 달성하기 위해 도시재생기업에 주목한다.

도시재생기업은 사회적기업, 마을기업, 협동조합 등의 이름으로 지원사업이나 공모사업을 통해 문을 열었다. 하지만 비즈니스에 대한 이해나 교육, 아이템의 부족 등 사업 지속성에 한계를 겪고 어려움에 처해 있는 조직이 많다. 저자들은 지속가능한 도시재생을 한 단계 끌어올릴 지역경제 비즈니스 모델을 제시한다.

제1편 도시재생의 이해
제1장 도시재생을 알아보자
도시는 혼자 살아갈 수 없다 | 서울은 어떻게 지금의 모습을 갖추었을까? | 도시재생은 어떻게 시작되었을까? | 도시재생을 하면 무엇이 좋아질까? | 어떻게 하면 도시재생이 지속될 수 있을까?

제2편 도시재생경제조직의 사업화(지역공동체조직의 사업화)
제1장 도시재생경제조직을 파악하자
시작하는 이유를 명확히 하자 | 열정과 행동을 구체화하자 | 사업화는 지역팀이 중심이다 | 방향과 신뢰가 중요하다
제2장 무엇을 어떻게 변화시킬 것인지 정하자
0(zero)의 중요성 | 조직에 대한 세 가지 오해 | 내 아이디어에 관심을 보이는 이를 파악한다 | 특정 개인과 구매과정을 주시하라 | 우리가 팔고자 하는 상품(서비스)을 제대로 알리자 | 말은 그만하고 숫자로 제시하라 | 비즈니스 모델과 사업계획서는 다르다 | 어디서부터 시작할지 구체적으로 정하라 | 테스트 제품부터 시작하라 | 모든 것을 융합하여 설명하자
제3장 우리 조직(나)이 더 하고 싶은 것은 무엇인가?(스케일업을 위한 전략)
고객이 참여하고 대화하도록 이끌자 | 당장 디지털화를 시작하자 | 비즈니스 모델을 다시 그리자 | 지역자원 활용범위의 확대를 기획하자 | 창업에서의 상권 vs. 도시재생에서의 상권, 관점이 다르다 | 민간투자를 목표로 성장전략을 수립해 보자 | 도시재생경제조직은 공공성과 경제성의 균형이 중요하다 | 이제부터가 시작이다

제3편 도시재생기업이란 무엇인가?
제1장 서울 도시재생기업의 이해
서울 도시재생기업이란? | 서울 도시재생기업에서는 무엇을 할까? | 서울 도시재생기업 어떻게 진행될까? | 서울 도시재생기업 어떻게 선정할까? | 서울 도시재생기업 어떻게 육성될까?
제2장 서울 도시재생기업의 사례

부동산 시장이 유례없는 대변혁의 시기를 맞고 있다. 코로나 바이러스의 유행으로 경기는 안 좋은데 집값과 전월세는 폭등하고, 상가 건물이 비어가는 와중 꼬마빌딩의 인기는 치솟고 있다. 영끌해서라도 내 집을 마련하려는 사람들, 서울에서 수도권으로 밀려나는 사람들에, 벼락부자가 된 사람들까지 뒤섞여 부동산 시장은 혼돈 그 자체다. 기존의 경험과 상식으로는 이해하기 힘든 상황에 사람들은 그야말로 ‘패닉’에 빠졌다. 

이런 대전환의 시기를 맞아 부동산 업계가 가장 신뢰하는 전문가인 김경민 서울대 교수가 ‘2022년 대한민국 부동산 시장에 대한 완벽한 해설서’를 제시한다. 빅데이터로 예측한 서울시 아파트 가격부터 코로나 이후 떠오를 핫 플레이스와 최신 투자 정보까지, 지금 반드시 주목해야 할 부동산 트렌드에 대해 상세히 분석했다. 저자는 신간 《부동산 트렌드 2022》에서 특히 2022년에는 대선과 지방선거, 금리 인상과 대출 절벽 같은 이슈가 쟁점이 되어 또 한 번 부동산 시장이 요동칠 거라 단언한다.

하버드대학교 부동산·도시계획 연구로 박사 학위를 받은 김경민 서울대 교수는, 수많은 부동산 투자자와 실수요자의 든든한 안내자 역할을 해왔다. 《부동산 트렌드 2022》는 현재 대한민국의 주요한 부동산 이슈를 총망라한 결정판이다. 책에 활용된 데이터 분석기법은 저자가 보스턴 소재 상업용 부동산…]]></summary>

부모처럼 살기 싫지만 부모만큼 되기도 어려운 세대, 밀레니얼. 그들은 ‘이번 생은 망했다’면서도 탈진 직전까지 일에 몰두하고, 필패하도록 설계된 체제에서 ‘졌지만 잘 싸웠다’며 자조한다. 밀레니얼 세대에게 ‘번아웃’은 신드롬이 아니다. 무기력과 불안정은 그들 삶 전반에 깔린 배경음악이자, 그들이 평생을 지내며 살아온 온도다. 

미국 유명 온라인 매체 <버즈피드>에서 700만 조회 수를 기록하며 국내 트위터상에서도 크게 회자한 칼럼 ‘밀레니얼은 어떻게 번아웃 세대가 되었는가’의 저자 앤 헬렌 피터슨은, 번아웃에 휩싸인 밀레니얼에게 결연히 선언한다. “반드시 이렇게 살 필요는 없다.” 더불어 그들이 겪은 실패와 좌절을 시대순으로 면밀히 살피며, 이 문제들이 사실은 예외주의와 능력주의를 기반으로 한 현대 자본주의 체제에서 비롯한 것이라고 분석한다. 아마존, 〈하퍼스 바자〉, 〈뉴욕 타임스〉, 〈에스콰이어〉에서 2020년 화제의 논픽션으로 손꼽힌 책 《요즘 애들》은 열정과 능력을 의심받으면서도 부단히 성실해야 하는 밀레니얼의 악전고투를 가감 없이 담아냈다.

작가의 말 _우리에겐 기회가 없다

· 화폐를 통한 상대 가치 
· 기축 통화와 효용
· 기축 통화의 변화

가치관과 효용 그리고 가치
· 화폐를 통해서 투영된 각 재화의 상대 가치
· 내가 느끼는 재화의 가치와 사회가 느끼는 재화의 가치
· 가치관이라는 단어는 참 특이하다
· 세상의 모든 가치는 가치관이란 필터로 결정된다
효용과 가치 그리고 마케팅
· 가치관과 사용 가치
· 미래적인 효용과 시간 가치
· 사회적 효용(Social Utility)
· 마케팅과 효용
· 광고가 만들어 내는 사회적 가치
가치관의 붕괴

코로나19를 뛰어넘는 바이러스가 몇 년마다 등장한다면? 진짜보다 더 진짜 같은 가상 인물이 세계 정치를 좌지우지한다면? 50도가 넘는 폭염이 계속된다면? 국내 최고의 미래 연구·교육기관인 카이스트 문술미래전략대학원 미래전략연구센터가 매년 발간하는 미래 보고서《카이스트 미래전략》. 

2022년에는 650여 명의 전문가가 참여해 인류에 의해 일어나는 극단적 사건, ‘X이벤트’를 살펴본다. 슈퍼코로나바이러스, 블랙아웃(대정전), 하이브리드 전쟁, 핀테크와 암호화폐로 인한 금융 대변동 등 우리 사회에 닥칠 수 있는 X이벤트를 제시하고 그 실현 가능성과 여파, 해결과제를 살펴본다. 

이어서 새로운 세상에서 기회를 잡기 위한 전략을 사회, 기술, 환경, 인구, 정치, 경제, 자원 7개 분야로 나눈 S.T.E.P.P.E.R 전략을 제시한다. 위기를 극복하고 그 속에 반짝이는 기회를 잡을 가장 객관적이고 통합적인 미래 전망.

글로벌 팬데믹은 블랙 스완처럼 전 세계인들의 생활 양식을 송두리째 바꾸어놓고 있다. 가까운 미래의 조심스러운 전망도 방역 단계에 따라 춤을 춘다. 예측이 힘든 시대, 그럼에도 불구하고 대중 소비자들의 태도(attitude)에 주목했다. 《2022 트렌드 모니터》는 2022년 변화의 핵심 키워드를 “강력한 영향력을 원하는 ‘슈퍼 개인’의 등장, 그리고 ‘일상적 통제 욕구의 확장’”으로 분석했다. 

끝이 요원해 보이는 팬데믹 상황에서 이 상황을 바꿀 수 없다고 인식한 사람들은 자신의 ‘태도’를 바꾸고 있다. 2022년 대중 소비자들은 막연한 불안감은 줄이고, 앞으로 어떤 변화가 있을지 궁금해하면서, 현재의 만족을 늦추고, 미래에 투자하려고 한다. 코로나19가 끝날 날을 막연히 기대하며 위시리스트를 적는 대신, 짠테크로 절약하고 다양한 방식으로 미래 가치에 투자한다. 불확실한 미래를 준비하기 위해 ‘현재의 만족을 지연(遲延)’시키고 있는 것이다.

이와 동시에 주변 환경과 일상, 사회와 정책 이슈에까지 광범위하게 개입하면서 ‘개인의 통제력’을 확대하려 하고 있다. 대중은 파편화되어 있으면서도, 강력한 영향력을 원하는 ‘슈퍼 개인’이 되려고 하는 듯 보인다. 하지만 ‘답답한’ 상황은 변하지 않는다(2021년 자주 경험하는 감정 1순위–답답하다). 개인은 점점 더 고립되어 가고, 소비…]]></summary>

삼성그룹 이건희 회장이 타계한지 꼭 1년(10월 25일)이 되었다. 이 책은 고인의 1주기를 맞아 고인과 가까이에서 일했던 전직 삼성맨들을 포함한 다양한 사람들의 생생한 증언을 중심으로 하면서 고인이 남긴 에세이집 ‘생각 좀 하며 세상을 보자’를 부분 발췌해 고인의 사상과 철학을 담았다.

이건희 회장은 기업인이었지만 시대를 앞서 읽은 예언자였으며, 이 힘든 세상을 어떻게 헤쳐가야 할지 지혜를 말해준 사상가였다. 지금까지 이건희 회장을 다룬 많은 책은 오직 그의 리더십과 기업 경영 능력을 다루는 쪽에 국한된 측면이 있다. 그러나 허문명 기자가 전직 삼성맨들의 증언, 고인이 남긴 글과 자료 등을 통해 입체적으로 완성해낸 이 책은 기업인이 아닌 사상가로서의 인간 이건희를 본격 조명한다. 책을 읽다보면 지금은 만날 수 없는 고인의 생각과 삶이 생생하게 느껴진다.

주식에 뛰어든 ‘주린이’들은 각종 전문 용어에 어려워하기 마련이다. D램, 양극재, 전해질, 팹리스 등, 전공자들에게는 기본 상식 수준의 내용이지만, 일상에서는 접하기 어려운 단어들! 주식투자를 꼭 하고 싶지만, 상장사에 대한, 그리고 그 상장사가 속한 산업에 대한 지식이 없는 채 투자를 하는 것은 얼마나 위험한 일인가? 이런 ‘주린이’들을 위해 18년 동안 산업현장을 직접 뛰어다녔던 현직기자인 강경래 작가가 직접 책을 내게 되었다.

강경래 기자는 [강경래의 인더스트리] 연재를 통해 산업에 대한 기초적인 지식과 상식을 전달해주었고, 많은 이들에게 긍정적인 반응을 얻었다. 그리고 조금 더 많은 이들에게 이러한 지식을 전달하고자, ‘주식투자에 꼭 필요한’ 산업 이야기들을 책으로 출간하게 되었다.

인터넷은 혁명을 불러올 것으로 기대되었다. 권위에 저항하고 권력을 무너뜨리고 문화뿐 아니라 정치의 영역에서도 민주화를 확산시킬 것이라 믿어졌다. 하지만 인터넷은 다른 방향으로 흘러가기 시작했다. 군사적 필요에서 등장했고, 국가적 기반을 통해 전파된 인터넷은 어쩌면 처음부터 중립적인 도구가 아니었을지도 모른다. 인터넷 시대를 맞아 몇몇 새로운 기업이 등장했지만, 이들 역시 인터넷이라는 구조가 만들어놓은 철로를 따라 움직이는 기차일 뿐이다. 

인터넷은 원래부터 권력과 지배력과 돈을 가지고 있던 사람들에게 더 많은 권력과 지배력과 돈을 안겨주었다. 인터넷과 인터넷이 작동하는 방식은 소수의 신념과 동기와 이해에 따라 결정되었다. 인터넷의 진짜 구조를 들여다보면 현대 세계를 움직이는 거대한 권력이 드러난다. 

현대 사회를 지배하고 있는 인터넷 기술과 문화를 통해 과거와 현재를 진단하는 이 책은 수면 아래 감춰진 인터넷의 진짜 구조를 파헤친다. 1부에서 저자는 인터넷을 만든 사람과 연결하는 사람, 관리하는 사람을 만난다. 이들은 인터넷이라는 시스템의 탄생과 유지에 기여하는 사람들이다. 

2부에서는 인터넷으로 가장 큰 이익을 얻는 집단인, 투자자와 광고업자를 다룬다. 세계적인 영향력을 행사하는 것으로 보이는 첨단 기술기업일지라도 중요한 결정권은 모두 투자자들에게 있음을 보게 될 것이다. 3부는 인터넷에서 벌어지는 전쟁을 다룬다. 인터넷은 문화적 영향력을 겨루는 전선이자, 강대국들의 전장이다. 국가와 기업, 시민단체, 개인이 뒤엉켜 전선은 광범위하게 펼쳐진다.

디지털 자산에 대한 명확한 개념과 현재 주목받는 디지털 자산의 종류를 정리하고, 국내외 글로벌 기업들의 사례 제시와 함께 전망 분석까지 나아간다. 이를 통해 디지털 자산에 관심을 가진 투자자들에게는 새로운 부의 기준을 소개하고, 관련 업계 종사자들에게는 미래 경제전망과 인사이트를 제시한다. 특히 자산에 대한 관점의 변화과정과 생태계 확장 속도를 다룸으로써, 가장 최신의 내용을 상세하게 담고 있다.

이 책은 비트코인이나 블록체인의 기술을 분석하거나 설명하는 기술서가 아니다. 그보다는 디지털 자산을 특정한 코인으로만 알고 있거나 모호하게 알고 있는 독자들에게 정확한 개념을 전하고 디지털 자산의 탄생으로 인한 변화를 알기 쉽게 설명한다. 

이와 더불어 디지털 자산 투자자들을 위한 안내서 역할도 하고 있다. 독자들은 이 책을 통해 디지털 시대로 나아가기 위해서 필수요소인 디지털 자산을 이해하고 관련 미래를 전망해 그 이면에 감춰진 인사이트를 파악할 수 있을 것이다. 

또한, 이 책은 현재 디지털 자산의 기술이 어디까지 발전했으며 글로벌 기업들이 주목하는 지점은 어디인지 한눈에 보여준다. 시장과 전망에 대한 이해가 선행돼야 미래의 부를 차지하기 위한 싸움에서 승리할 수 있다.
