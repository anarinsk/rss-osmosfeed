        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We add to recent evidence on deindustrialization and document a new pattern: increasing industry polarization over time. We assess whether these patterns can be explained by a dynamic open economy model of structural change in which the two primary driving forces are sector-biased productivity growth and sectoral trade integration. We calibrate the model to the same countries used to document our patterns. We find that sector-biased productivity growth is important for deindustrialization, and sectoral trade integration is important for industry polarization through specialization. The interaction of these two driving forces is also essential. The key transmission channel is the declining relative price of manufacturing goods to services over time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Provider payments are the key determinant of insurance generosity within many health insurance programs covering low-income populations. This paper analyzes the effects of a large, federally-mandated provider payment increase for primary care services provided to low-income elderly and disabled individuals.  Drawing upon comprehensive administrative payment and utilization data, we leverage variation across beneficiaries and across providers in the policy-induced payment increase in difference-in-differences and triple differences research designs. The estimates indicate that the provider payment reform led to a 6.3% increase in the targeted services provided to eligible beneficiaries, indicating an implied payment elasticity of 1.3.  Further, the provider payment reform decreased the fraction of low-income beneficiaries with no primary care visit in a year by 9%, completely closing the gap relative to higher-income beneficiaries with the same observable characteristics. Additionally, the results indicate that the payment reform caused an increase in established patient visits, with no increase in new patient visits. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the payment increase led to an expansion of utilization for many subgroups, with somewhat larger effects among beneficiaries who are younger, are white, and live in areas with many primary care providers per capita.]]></summary>

Diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimates using conﬁdential US Census Data on manufacturing establishments show that tax policies increased both investment and employment, but did not lead to wage or productivity gains. Using a structural model, we show that the primary eﬀect of the policy was to increase the use of all inputs by lowering overall costs of production. The policy further stimulated production employment due to the complementarity of production labor and capital. Supporting this conclusion, we ﬁnd that investment is greater in plants with lower labor costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facing unprecedented uncertainty and drastic trade-offs between public health and other forms of human well-being, policy makers during the Covid-19 pandemic have sought the guidance of epidemiologists and economists. Unfortunately, while both groups of scientists use many of the same basic mathematical tools, the models they develop to inform policy tend to rely on different sets of assumptions and, thus, often lead to different policy conclusions. This divergence in policy recommendations can lead to uncertainty and confusion, opening the door to disinformation, distrust of institutions, and politicization of scientific facts. Unfortunately, to date, there have not been widespread efforts to build bridges and find consensus or even to clarify sources of differences across these fields, members of whom often continue to work within their traditional academic silos. In response to this “crisis of communication,” we convened a group of scholars from epidemiology, economics, and related fields (e.g., statistics, engineering, and health policy) to discuss approaches to modeling economy-wide pandemics. We summarize these conversations by providing a consensus view of disciplinary differences (including critiques) and working through a specific policy example. Thereafter, we chart a path forward for more effective synergy between disciplines, which we hope will lead to better policies as the current pandemic evolves and future pandemics emerge.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies optimal capital-control and bank-reserve remuneration policy in an open economy with a banking channel and a collateral constraint that limits household debt by a fraction of income. It finds that the unregulated economy borrows too little relative to what is optimal (underborrowing). This finding contrasts with the standard overborrowing result obtained in the absence of a banking channel. Under optimal policy, the central bank injects bank reserves during recessions. In this way, the monetary authority is able to uncouple household deleveraging from economy-wide deleveraging, thereby ameliorating the severity of the financial crisis. The paper documents that in emerging and developed economies the lending spread (lending rate minus deposit rate) displayed a muted response during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. This fact is consistent with a decline in the demand rather than in the supply of loans and gives credence to models in which the collateral constraint is placed at the level of the nonfinancial sector as opposed to at the level of the bank.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congress responded to the COVID pandemic’s disruptions to instruction with unprecedented federal aid for school districts. While this relief has been widely characterized as a major windfall for K-12 education, per-pupil amounts vary considerably across districts, as will the costs districts face for COVID mitigation and recovery. In this paper, we conduct simulations to understand the potential distribution of net effects of the pandemic and federal aid on the finances of local school districts in the next several years. In our baseline scenario, we assume one-time adjustment costs of $500 per pupil plus additional costs of $1,000 per student in poverty and $500 per student not in poverty per year for four years. Federal aid was distributed proportional to the longstanding Title I program, which sends more money per pupil to higher poverty districts. Low-poverty districts are therefore projected to face some budgetary shortfalls, while many higher poverty districts are projected to have excess funds, which they could direct towards long-standing challenges. While our findings depend on key assumptions about the COVID-related costs, we find significant district-level variation in simulated net fiscal impacts, in part but not completely due to poverty rates, across all the scenarios we consider.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper evaluates the impact of slowing economic growth on labor market dynamism and misallocation. It provides a model of endogenous growth via imitation in a frictional labor market. The framework accounts for rich data on worker job-to-job transitions as well as stochastic and lifecycle properties of firm growth and job reallocation. High productivity entrants gradually replace obsolescing incumbents by poaching their workers, a process that is intermediated via a frictional labor market. When the likelihood of entrants imitating technologies in the tail of the distribution falls (ideas are harder to find), so does growth. Consistent with US data over the past 30 years, firm entry, incumbents’ employment response to productivity shocks, and job-to-job transitions decline, while the share of old firms increases. With lower imitation, however, there is less misallocation, because the slower aggregate rate of obsolescence induces productive firms to invest more in costly hiring and grow faster to their optimal size.]]></summary>

First, air and water pollution have declined substantially, although greenhouse gas emissions have not. Second, environmental policy explains a large share of these trends. Third, much of the regulation of air and drinking water pollution has benefits that exceed costs, although the evidence for surface water pollution regulation is less clear. Fourth, while the distribution of pollution across social groups is unequal, market-based environmental policies and command-and-control policies do not appear to produce systematically different distributions of environmental outcomes. I also discuss recent innovations in methods and data that can be used to evaluate pollution trends and policies, including the increased use of environmental administrative data, statistical cost-benefit comparisons, analysis of previously understudied policies, more sophisticated analyses of pollution transport, micro-macro frameworks, and a focus on the distribution of environmental outcomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Empirical tests in the 1990s found little evidence of poor countries catching up with rich - unconditional convergence - since the 1960s, and divergence over longer periods. This stylized fact spurred several developments in growth theory, including AK models, poverty trap models, and the concept of convergence conditional on determinants of steady-state income. We revisit these findings, using the subsequent 25 years as an out-of-sample test, and document a trend towards unconditional convergence since 1990 and convergence since 2000, driven by both faster catch-up growth and slower growth of the frontier. During the same period, many of the correlates of growth - human capital, policies, institutions, and culture - also converged substantially and moved in the direction associated with higher income. Were these changes related? Using the omitted variable bias formula, we decompose the gap between unconditional and conditional convergence as the product of two cross-sectional slopes. First, correlate-income slopes, which remained largely stable since 1990. Second, growth-correlate slopes controlling for income - the coefficients of growth regressions - which remained stable for fundamentals of the Solow model (investment rate, population growth, and human capital) but which flattened substantially for other correlates, leading unconditional convergence to converge towards conditional convergence.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We examine how disadvantaged students make postsecondary education decisions, focusing on why they often opt for short, ﬂexible programs that tend to have low returns in the labor market. Prior literature emphasizes information deﬁcits and ﬁnancial constraints. We draw upon qualitative data collected via open-ended interviews conducted with a sample of economically disadvantaged Black youth in Baltimore. We use these data to develop and explore a complementary narrative: students who have faced instability or hardship in the form of disruptive events, or “adverse shocks” (e.g., violence, eviction or incarceration of a family member), anticipate future shocks that could derail their educational plans. In response, they opt for shorter, more ﬂexible educational programs that they expect they can complete despite anticipated shocks. When possible, we corroborate this narrative using publicly available, large-N data sets such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Finally, we formalize this narrative as a simple dynamic structural model calibrated using data on education choices and returns. The model clariﬁes that it is impossible to identify costs of schooling without data on beliefs about the probability of non-completion, thus providing guidance on future data collection priorities. More broadly, our approach demonstrates a novel application of mixed methods research: using qualitative data to aid in the speciﬁcation of a structural model. This approach could be applied in other contexts where behavior is poorly understood and extant data do not contain all of the information needed to generate and test plausible hypotheses.]]></summary>

Both studied at Cambridge University, where Paley became one of the first women to take the Tripos exam and the first female lecturer in economics, with Marshall’s encouragement. But in later life, Marshall opposed granting Cambridge degrees to women and their participation in academic economics. This paper recounts Alfred Marshall’s use of gender norms, born out of a separate spheres ideology, to promote and ingrain women’s exclusion in academic economics and beyond. We demonstrate the persistence of this ideology and resultant norms, drawing parallels between gendered inequities in labor market outcomes for Cambridge graduates in the UK post-Industrial Revolution and those apparent in cross-country data today. We argue that the persistence of the norms produced by separate spheres ideologies is likely to reflect, at least in part, the rents associated with preferential access to better paid, high-skilled labor market opportunities. In doing so, we ask who benefits from gender norms, who enforces them, and suggest relevant policy work and areas for future research.]]></summary>

We found high support for state PFL programs in 2019 that rose substantially over the course of the pandemic: by the fall of 2020, almost 70% of firms were supportive. Increases in support were larger among firms that had an employee use PFL, suggesting that experience with PFL led to employers becoming more supportive.

To study demographic transitions across time and space, we compile a data set of birth and death rates for 186 countries spanning more than 250 years. We document that (i) a demographic transition has been completed or is ongoing in nearly every country; (ii) the speed of transition has increased over time; and (iii) having more neighbors that have started the transition is associated with a higher probability of a country beginning its own transition. To account for these observations, we build a quantitative model in which parents choose child quantity and educational quality. Countries differ in geographic location, and improved production and medical technologies diffuse outward from Great Britain. Our framework replicates well the timing and increasing speed of transitions. It also produces a correlation between the speeds of fertility transition and increases in schooling similar to the one in the data.]]></summary>

Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $81.17	per barrel and Brent at $82.45 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $40, and Brent was at $42 - so WTI oil prices are up double year-over-year.

Here are few excerpts from the note: 
While the unemployment rate continues to fall quickly, labor force participation has made no progress since August 2020. ... Most of the 5.0mn persons who have exited the labor force since the start of the pandemic are over age 55 (3.4mn), largely reflecting early (1.5mn) and natural (1mn) retirements that likely won’t reverse. The outlook for prime-age persons who have exited the labor force (1.7mn) is more positive, since very few are discouraged and most still view their exits as temporary.

The number of job openings was little changed at 10.4 million on the last business day of September, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires and total separations were little changed at 6.5  million and 6.2 million, respectively. Within separations, the quits level and rate increased to a series  high of 4.4 million and 3.0 percent, respectively. The layoffs and discharges rate was unchanged at 0.9  percent.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (yellow line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 
This series started in December 2000.
Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for September, the most recent employment report was for October.
 Click on graph for larger image.
Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.
The huge spike in layoffs and discharges in March  2020 are labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.
Jobs openings decreased in September to 10.438 million from 10.629 million in August.
The number of job openings (yellow) were up 58% year-over-year. 
Quits were up 34% year-over-year to a new record high.  These are voluntary separations. (see light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for "quits").]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This data is as of November 9th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Drop Below 2% Entering November
Forbearance plan exit volumes increased week-over-week heading into November as the share of mortgage loans in forbearance fell below 2% for the first time since the early stages of the pandemic.
According to our McDash Flash daily mortgage performance dataset, the number of loans in active forbearance fell 123,000 (-10.8%). The week’s strongest declines were among loans held in bank portfolios and private label securities, which recorded a reduction of 59,000 (-15.9%). FHA/VA plans also showed significant improvement, declining by 48,000 (-11.3), while GSE loans in forbearance plans decreased by 16,000 (-4.8%).
As of November 9, 1.01 million mortgage holders remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans, representing 1.9% of all active mortgages, including 1.2% of GSE, 3.1% of FHA/VA and 2.4% of portfolio/PLS loans.
  Click on graph for larger image.
  
  Nearly 300,000 borrowers have left their plans over the past two weeks down from 455,000 over the same two-week period last month as we hit the downslope of exit activity. That said, more than 250,000 plans are still listed with October/November reviews for extension/removal. Half of those are expected to reach final expiration, which could lead to continued improvement, albeit at a slower pace, in the weeks ahead.
Plan entries were down 9% from a week ago, logging one of the lowest weeks in terms of new entries since the onset of the pandemic.

Florian Englmaier tells Tim Phillips about new research into what gives these teams the will to win. Do they respond to having a common sense of identity, do they want kudos and status from other people, or are they just looking for a cash prize?

This column discusses new evidence for a panel of advanced and emerging economies on the impact of very high temperatures on prices. It finds that extreme temperatures have noticeable effects on price developments even in the medium term, although more so in emerging than in advanced economies. On balance, the impact of high temperatures on prices appears to be on the upside in the short term, and on the downside in the medium term.]]></summary>

Using large-scale survey and experimental data, this column investigates how Black and white Americans perceive racial inequities, why they believe those inequities persist, and what interventions they would support to correct them. A stark partisan gap emerges: white Democrats and Black respondents tend to attribute racial inequities to the history of slavery and discrimination – and favour redistributive policies – while white Republicans tend to attribute those inequities to individual decisions or insufficient effort and oppose interventions to reduce them.]]></summary>

Excerpt: 
This is the third look at local markets in October. This update adds Albuquerque, Atlanta, Colorado, Houston, Jacksonville, Minnesota, Portland, Sacramento and Santa Clara.
...
Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported so far in October. For these markets, inventory was down 7.9% in October MoM from September, and down 25.1% YoY.
Of the markets that have reported so far, inventories in Jacksonville and San Diego are at record lows.  Sacramento is the only market so far with inventory up YoY in October.
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these markets were down 22.9% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is slightly larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market.

From CoStar: STR: Weekly US Hotel Occupancy Drops Below 60%
U.S. hotel performance increased slightly from the previous week, according to STR‘s latest data through November 6.
October 31 through November 6, 2021 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019*):
• Occupancy: 59.8% (-13.0%)
• Average daily rate (ADR): $128.14 (-3.2%)
• Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $76.61 (-15.8%)
*Due to the steep, pandemic-driven performance declines of 2020, STR is measuring recovery against comparable time periods from 2019.
   emphasis added
The following graph shows the seasonal pattern for the hotel occupancy rate using the four week average.

The red line is for 2021, black is 2020, blue is the median, dashed purple is 2019, and dashed light blue is for 2009 (the worst year on record for hotels prior to 2020).

Note: Y-axis doesn't start at zero to better show the seasonal change.


The occupancy rate will now decline seasonally into the new year.]]></summary>

이와나미 시리즈. 노벨 경제학상 후보로 거론되기로 했던 세계적인 경제학자 모리시마 미치오. 2004년 사망했지만, 이미 국내에서도 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》 등으로 유명한 그는 LSE 교수로 역임하면서 세계적으로 이름을 날리기 시작했다. 그는 친 자본주의와 자유주의 성향인  노벨 경제학상 선정 위원회의 경향에 맞지 않아 경제학상 수상에는 실패했으나, 일본 경제 위기를 진단하는 《왜 일본은 몰락하는가》로 우리에게도 많은 교훈을 준다. 

이 책은 모리시마 미치오가 NHK에서 강의한 내용을 바탕으로 마르크스, 미제스, 케인스를 추가하여 11명의 유명 경제학자들의 사상에 관해 설명하고 있다. 방송을 기본으로 했기 때문에 어려운 근대경제학 역사를 좀 더 쉽고 정확하게 이해하는 데 도움이 된다.

근대경제학이 마주한 당시 시대 상황은 두 차례 세계대전과 대공황으로 점철된 격변의 시기였다. 그렇기에 당연히 새로운 경제 체제가 모색되었고, 많은 경제학자들이 경제학과 사회학의 종합화를 제창하였다. 저자 역시 이러한 경제학의 과제가 21세기까지도 유효하다고 보고 이 책을 집필하였다. 

책에 서술한 경제학자들이 자기 분야의 협소한 경제이론을 파고들기만 한 학자가 아닌 인간과 사회의 큰 틀에서 경제를 바라본 학자들 위주로 선정한 것도 그러한 까닭이다. 이것이 이 책의 가장 큰 장점이라 하겠다.

데이터로부터 통찰을 얻으려면 데이터를 정제해야 한다. 데이터를 적절히 정제하지 않고 곧바로 분석에 들어갔다가는 잘못된 결과를 얻게 될 수 있기 때문이다. 《파이썬 데이터 클리닝 쿡북》은 파이썬으로 데이터를 다루고 정제할 때 사용할 수 있는 도구와 기법을 보여준다.

먼저 통상적인 데이터 소스로부터 데이터를 얻고 형태를 확인하는 일상적인 작업을 하는 법을 보여준다. 그런 다음, 데이터를 유용한 형태로 바꾸는 법을 가르친다. 원하는 데이터를 골라내고 요약함으로써 통찰을 얻는 법, 도출된 문제점을 해결하는 법도 알려준다. 

이어서 누락값 처리, 오류 검사, 중복 데이터 제거, 이상값과 날짜를 다루는 법으로 진행한다. 지도학습으로 예상치 못한 값과 분류 오류를 식별하고, 탐색적 데이터 분석(EDA)을 위한 시각화를 통해 예상치 못한 값을 식별한다. 끝으로, 새로운 데이터에 대해서도 수정 없이 재사용할 수 있는 함수와 클래스를 작성한다.

However, twice as many panellists thought these rules harmed the conduct of macroeconomic policy than those that thought they helped.

Excerpt: 
We are being flooded with housing stories.  Will house prices decline or will price growth just slow?  Does the US have a housing shortage?   If mortgage rates rise to 4%, will that “halt the housing market” as Ivy Zelman said on CNBC?
Although my crystal ball is cloudy at this point, I believe inventory will tell the tale.  That is why I watch inventory closely.  Not just the monthly existing home sales report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the monthly new home sales report from the Census Bureau.  I also use weekly data from Altos Research (See Altos’ Mike Simonsen’s weekly presentation on YouTube).
And I track inventory and sales for 30+ local markets each month.
...
My Spidey senses are tingling, however it isn't obvious why this time - or what the outcome will be.
But I believe one thing is certain: inventory will tell the tale!

Here is a summary of active listings for the housing markets that have reported so far in October.  For these markets, inventory was down 9.6% in October MoM from September, and down 30.4% YoY.
Inventory in San Diego is at an all time low!
Inventory almost always declines seasonally in October, so the MoM decline is not a surprise. Last month, these eight markets were down 27.4% YoY, so the YoY decline in October is larger than in September. This is not indicating a slowing market (but this is just 8 early reporting markets).

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Center for Microeconomic Data today issued its Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. The Report shows that total household debt increased by $286 billion (1.9%) to $15.24 trillion in the third quarter of 2021. The total debt balance is now $1.1 trillion higher than at the end of 2019. It is also $890 billion higher than in Q3 2020, and $2.57 trillion higher, in nominal terms, than the $12.68 trillion peak seen in 2008. The Report is based on data from the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel, a nationally representative random sample of individual- and household-level debt and credit records drawn from anonymized Equifax credit dat…]]></summary>

I'm looking at data for some second home markets - and I'm tracking those markets to see if there is an impact from the lending changes.
This graph is for South Lake Tahoe since 2004 through October 2021, and shows inventory (blue), and the year-over-year (YoY) change in the median price (12 month average).
  
Note: The median price is distorted by the mix, but this is the available data.
  
   Click on graph for larger image.
Following the housing bubble, prices declined for several years in South Lake Tahoe, with the median price falling about 50% from the bubble peak.
Currently inventory is still very low - above the record low set early in 2021, but down YoY - and prices are up sharply YoY.   

This will be interesting to watch, but so far there isn't any evidence of a 2nd home slowdown in these numbers (The fires don't seem to have impacted these numbers either).]]></summary>

모든 국민에게 조건 없이 일정한 금액의 돈을 정기적으로 지급하는 기본소득. 모두에게 속한 ‘공유부’를 분배하자는 것이다 보니 돈이 많은 부자에게도 지급한다. 게다가 일을 하지 않아도 주는 무조건성의 원칙 때문에 자칫 사람들의 노동의욕을 꺾는 것은 아닐지, 기본소득 도입으로 선별 복지의 수혜자들에게는 오히려 복지가 줄어드는 것은 아닐지 의문이 꼬리에 꼬리를 문다.

기본소득이 화두가 되면서 여전히 많은 사람들이 의구심을 갖고 있다. 하지만, 소모적인 논쟁 대신 기본소득이 정확히 어떤 개념이며, 어떤 원칙을 가진 제도인지 꼼꼼하게 알아볼 필요가 있다. 

어려운 경제개념을 쉽고 재미있게 이해할 수 있도록 만화로 구성된 이 책은 기본소득의 원리와 5대 원칙, 기본소득이 탄생한 역사적 배경과 경제철학을 소개하는 것은 물론이고, 기본소득을 둘러싼 여러 의혹들을 명쾌하게 해명, 실제 입법이 되려면 어떤 숙의 과정이 필요한지, 재원 마련은 어떻게 하는지, 적정한 지급액은 얼마로 추정하는지 등 기본소득을 둘러싼 모든 개념과 궁금증을 해소해준다.

‘금의 가격’은 전 세계적인 경제 위기 때마나 가파른 상승세를 보이며 급등했다. 멀게는 1929년 대공황 때부터 가깝게는 2008년 세계금융위기를 거치며 급등을 반복, 2011년에는 1온스당 장중 1,900달러 선을 돌파하며 사상 최고점을 찍었다. 이를 통해, 경제 위기→양적완화→달러 가치 하락→금의 급등으로 이어지는 흐름이 공식처럼 굳어졌다.

2019년, 코로나 팬데믹이 전 세계를 강타하고, 각국의 경제가 위기에 빠지자, 다시 ‘금의 가격’이 요동치고 있다. 거기에 더해, 이미 바닥을 드러낸 금의 추정 매장량과 달러의 대량 공급 등이 과거 경제 위기 때보다 금의 가격 상승 요인을 더욱 풍부하게 뒷받침하고 있다. 2008년 세계금융위기 때 위기를 기회로 바꿨던 전설적 투자가들이 다시 금에 집중하는 이유다.

PART 1_코로나 팬데믹이 불러온 금의 대시세
위기를 기회로 형성된 금의 대시세

PART 2_기본적인 금 수급 살펴보기
유사 이래 채굴한 금, 20만 톤

과거 10년에 걸쳐 왕성한 매입을 계속한 공적 부문
중앙은행과 금준비 입장 변화
금 가격의 전환점

반세기 전에 일어난 대변화
1980년- 버블화된 금
위기 시의 달러 뒤에 가라앉은 금
전환기가 된 2000년
2008년 리먼 쇼크 직후 금의 움직임

코로나 팬데믹과 전대미문의 금융완화
적극적으로 위험을 무릅쓰기 시작한 FRB
금융 비대화 속에서 반복되는 버블 생성과 붕괴
코로나 팬데믹에 가려진 채권 버블 붕괴 위기

구독경제는, 사용자(구독자)가 일정 기간 동안 일정 금액, 즉 구독료를 내고 원하는 상품이나 서비스를 제공받는 경제활동을 말한다. 이전부터 있었지만, 새롭게 주목받고 있는 유통 서비스이다. 용도에 따라 변화를 추구하고 그에 따른 경험을 누리는 것, 그것이 주는 가치가 매우 중요해진 요즘 시기에 주목하지 않을 수 없다.

현 MZ세대는 직접 하는 요리나, 청소 등 집안일에 들어가는 시간을 아끼고 출퇴근 시간에 들어가는 시간을 아껴서 자신에게 투자하는 것을 선호한다. 자신이 좋아하는 취미활동을 하는 데 시간과 돈과 에너지를 아끼지 않는다. 이러한 현상은 젊은 세대일수록 뚜렷하게 나타난다.

아직 경제활동을 하는 1인 가구라면 내가 가장 중요하기 때문에 무엇을 하든 가장 효율적인 방법을 찾기 마련이다. 내가 가장 즐겁고 행복해지는 방법을 우선적으로 찾으며, 나에게 다양한 경험을 주는 것들에 흔쾌히 마음을 내어줄 것이고 그것들에 가치와 의미를 부여할 것이다. 즉 이러한 소비자의 입맛에 맞추어 소비자가 원하는 유무형의 아이템을 제공한다는 것이 구독경제의 핵심이다.

인터넷에 공개된 데이터를 수집하는 일을 ‘크롤링(Crawling)’, 이 데이터를 해석해 필요한 데이터를 구하는 일을 ‘스크래핑(Scaping)’이라고 하는데, 파이썬은 인터넷에 액세스할 수 있는 라이브러리가 풍부해 이 두가지 모두 쉽고 편하게 할 수 있는 언어로 널리 알려져 있다. 이 책에서는 스크래핑을 하는 라이브러리 ‘Beautiful Soup4’아 데이터를 분석하는 라이브러리 ‘판다스(pandas)’를 사용해 실제로 파이썬의 핵심 기능에 접근할 수 있도록 한다.

이 책의 예제 코드와 함께 홈페이지 회원들에게만 제공하는 회원특전 PDF는 예제와 라이브러리 사용법 간이 매뉴얼로 성안당 홈페이지(www.cyber.co.kr) [도서몰]에 회원가입 후 [자료실]-[자료실] 바로가기에서 도서 검색을 통해 다운로드할 수 있다.

인간과 시공간이라는 물리적 한계를 넘어 그 속에서 상호 융합 및 공진화하게 될 메타버스 글로벌 시장! 지금까지 계속 관망만 해 왔다면, 이제는 마지막 기회가 될 메타버스에 과감히 탑승하길 바란다. 앞으로 AR·VR 등 XR 기반의 기업들과 AI, 블록체인 기업들이 힘을 합쳐 지속적으로 메타버스 기술 개발을 이끌어가야 할 것이다. 

메타버스 시장은 2020년 50조 원, 2023년 535조 원 이상, 2030년에는 1,700조 원가량 성장할 전망이며, 우리나라는 향후 5년간 2.6조 원의 메타버스 관련 예산을 단계적으로 집행할 예정이다. 그렇다면 그 주인공은 누가 될 것인가? 현재로서는 예측이 불가하지만 문화와 IT 기술, 콘텐츠 강국인 대한민국이 그 주인공이었으면 하는 바람이다. 그리고 그 변화의 바람에 나도 함께할 것이다.

어떻게 하면 이 시대 청년들에게 꿈과 희망을 줄 수 있을까? 이 시대적 과제에 대한 해결책을 모색하고자 뜻을 같이하는 교수 6명이 이 책을 집필하게 되었다. 더 이상 강단에서 지켜보지만 말고 시대에 역행하는 모순을 바로잡아야만 한다는 사명감에서 출발하였다. 

흔히 우리는 기술혁신이 일자리를 빼앗고 소득 양극화를 심화시킬 수 있다고 오해하기 쉽다. 그러나 이는 편견에 지나지 않으며, 불평등 사회를 조장하는 것은 기술혁신이 아니라 그 혁신을 가로막는 제도다. 그 제도 때문에 일자리가 줄어드는 것이다.

제1장 노동시장의 이중구조와 노동조합의 사회적 책임

1. 노동조합이 노동시장 양극화를 만든 모순
기형적인 한국의 노동조합
불평등을 키우는 노동조합
모순에 빠진 한국의 노동운동

2. 노동시장은 왜 단절되었는가
노동법과 노동시장의 괴리
빈익빈부익부 만드는 노동정치
민주화와 노동운동
민주노총과 전투적 노동운동의 모순
노사정의 사회적 대화의 실패
노동의 경제민주화와 기울어진 정책무대
기업의 사회적 책임 및 공공성 강화와 고용의 왜곡
노동조합의 비정상적 운영 관행
낙후된 노동법

3. 노동조합의 사회적 책임은 우리나라만의 문제인가
노동조합의 사회적 책임
자본주의와 노동조합의 사회적 책임
정부와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：미국
정치와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：영국
복지와 노동조합의 사회적 책임：스웨덴
기술혁신과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：독일
고용과 노동조합의 사회적 책임：프랑스와 남부 유럽

4. 디지털 시대의 노동, 무엇을 어떻게 할 것인가
디지털 시대의 노동시장과 노동조합
손 놓고 있는 한국
노동개혁의 방향
일자리문제의 시각부터 바로잡자
중소기업을 고임금 일자리로 만들자
교육훈련을 사회적 권리로 만들자
후진적인 임금고용관행을 바꾸자
노동조합은 사회적 책임 강화에 나서라
노동법을 바꾸자
정치적 결단이 요구된다

제2장 최저임금제도의 역설：2018년~2019년 2년간 최저임금 29.1% 인상의 부작용

1. 최저임금제도, 왜 사회경제적 논란이 되었나

시장이 클수록 혁신에 대한 보상은 증가하며, 이는 더 많은 혁신을 불러온다. 그러나 전 세계 인구의 0.7%에도 미치지 못하지만 세계 10위의 경제 규모를 가지게 된 우리나라는 무역을 통해서 혁신을 자극하는 효과를 누려왔다. 박지형 교수는 한국의 사례를 들어 국내의 인적·물적 자원뿐 아니라 전 세계 자원을 효과적으로 활용해야 지속적 혁신을 할 수 있다고 강조한다.

2021년 글로벌혁신지수(Global Innovation Index)에서 한국은 스위스, 스웨덴, 미국, 영국에 이어 세계 5위의 혁신국가로 평가됐다. 하지만 한국은 ‘기술 융합 역량’은 우수한 편이나 ‘창의적 사고’와 ‘공정하고 유연한 제도’의 면에서는 다른 선진국에 비해 뒤처진다. 이정민 교수는 정부가 충분한 숙려 기간과 사전 검토 기간을 거친 후 정책을 체계적으로 결정해야 엉뚱한 곳으로 투자 자원이 소모되지 않는다고 지적한다.

돈이 무엇인지 설명한다. 세계사의 여러 장면을 조명해 돈이 어떻게 만들어지고, 어떻게 발전해왔는지 알아본다. 지배자들은 돈에 개입해 주화라는 개념을 만들면서 시뇨리지를 챙기고, 지배자들의 더 큰 개입은 훗날 은행으로 발전한다. 

천재 과학자 뉴턴은 영국의 금본위제를 도입하고 이는 산업혁명과 함께 유럽 전체가 금본위제를 도입하게 되는 시발점이 된다. 사실 영국의 금본위제는 우연과 실수의 산물이며 이는 중국과 유럽 사이의 무역 불균형에서 초래한 바가 크다.

한편, 두 번의 세계 대전을 거쳐 미국의 달러는 소위 기축통화의 위치를 얻게 되는데 소위 브레튼 우즈 협약을 통해 미국 달러는 종이로 만든 금의 위치에 오르게 된다. 훗날 IMF는 SDR이라는 형태로 케인스가 주창했던 방코르를 흉내 내고 이는 현재까지도 세계 무역의 기본이 되는 통화다. 

이 밖에도 미국과 일본의 양적완화와 테이퍼링, 인플레이션과 초인플레이션, 현대 통화 이론 등을 살펴보며 미국 정책금리와 통화량의 변화도 알아본다. 전 세계를 뜨겁게 달군 비트코인도 조명한다. 비트코인은 화폐인지, 비트코인은 투자인지 투기인지, FATF와 가상자산은 무엇인지, 암호화폐와 토큰, NFT, DeFi, CBDC, DAO 비트코인과 엘살바도르의 위험한 실험, 디지털 자산의 실체도 자세히 살펴본다.

1장. 화폐의 등장

경제라는 복잡한 세계의 입구에서 갈팡질팡하는 분들을 위해 쓰인 책이다. 비즈니스는 물론이고 정치와 행정 등 모든 사회적 현상의 기초에는 경제 문제가 관련되어 있다. 하지만 일반적인 경제학 입문서나 교과서에는 추상적인 개념만 가득할 뿐, 우리의 실생활과 어떤 관련이 있는지는 찾아보기 어렵다. 

이 책은 ‘가격’이라는, 경제에서 가장 기초가 되는 키워드를 바탕으로 쓰인 책이다. 가격이 상품과 함께 태어나서 자라나는 험난한 여정을 따라가며, 가격이 수행하는 사회적 역할의 크기를 살펴보고 어떤 사람들이 어떻게 가격을 만들고 키워내는지, 그 과정을 거슬러 올라가며 확인할 것이다. 또 사회 속에 존재하는, 가격을 중심으로 한 전반적인 경제 시스템을 탐구해 나갈 것이다.

가격은 ‘우리의 생활’ 그 자체다. 이 책의 의도는 가격 결정 과정에서부터 시작된 경제가 사회에서 실제로 어떻게 작용하는지, 그 생생한 시스템을 보여 주는 것이다. 약속하건대 이 책을 읽는 사람은 누구든 경제가 무엇인지 명확하게 실감할 수 있게 될 것이다.

들어가며 - 옛날에는 주먹밥에 가격이 없었다?
프롤로그 - 가격을 통해 보는 사회 시스템

제1장 우리는 가격에 의지해 구매할 수밖에 없는가?
물건을 산다는 것은 무엇일까? 
사실 구매자는 상품에 대해 잘 모른다 
왜 내가 올 것이라는 것을 미리 알고 있을까? 
우리의 눈은 ‘이안 반사식 카메라’ 
가격은 경제의 ‘키 플레이어’

제2장 경제의 이모저모는 가격이 조정한다
전제: 시장경제란 무엇일까 
매매에서는 ‘가격’과 ‘수량’이 문제 
‘가격 메커니즘’ - 가격이 움직이면 수량도 움직인다 
경매에서는 ‘가격 메커니즘’이 작동한다 
가격 메커니즘은 그래프로 나타낼 수 있다 

제3장 투입한 생산비용을 회수할 수 있을까?
상품을 생산한다는 것은 무엇일까? 
상품이 팔리지 않는 것이 가장 큰 문제 
이익을 키우는 방법 
리스크가 적은 행동을 선택한다 
드디어 출하! 
가격은 생산자의 생명줄

제4장 가격은 어떻게 결정되는가?
현실의 시장은 어떤 시스템인가? 
시장에는 상품도 기업도 모여든다 
도매상을 중심으로 사고팔다 
경매 거래로 공정한 가격을 만든다 
시장이라는 시스템을 
경제학적으로 생각해 보자 
경매의 구조 
수요와 공급은 어떻게 가격을 결정할까

제5장 전부 팔아 치우기 위한 전략적 가격 결정
소매상에 있어 가격이란 무엇일까? 
상점에서는 가격을 어떻게 결정할까? 
소비자는 어떻게 판단할까? 
소비자의 ‘실속있는 소비’, 그 적정 가격은? 
타점포와의 가격 경쟁도 있다 
‘가격을 파는’ 전략을 취한다 
이렇게 해서 가격이 결정된다

제6장 최후의 관문, 소비자의 ‘까다로운 눈’
적절한 가격을 순간적으로 판단하는 기준은? 
쇼핑의 심리와 행동의 흐름 
우리는 매번 합리적으로 판단하지는 않는다 
판매자가 교묘히 이용하는 쇼핑 심리 
우리도 경험을 쌓아 직감을 기르자

덧붙이는 장 눈에 보이지 않는 가격도 있다
칼럼① 무료여도 괜찮을까? 
칼럼② 보이지 않는 가격에는 어떤 의미가 있을까? 
칼럼③ 가격의 끝자리를 주목하자 
칼럼④ ...

대학에서 지난 수년간 “소프트웨어 프로그래밍(파이썬)” 과목을 강의하면서 다양한 교과서를 살펴보았다. 어떤 서적은 한 학기에 파이썬 교육을 완성하기에 분량이 너무 많았고 시간이 부족해서 적절한 교과서를 찾기 쉽지 않았다. 연세대 강의는 전교의 다양한 학생들이 수강하고 있으며 거의 대부분의 수강생들이 프로그래밍 배경이 전혀 없는 상태이다. 실제 강의는 매주 강의 2시간 및 실습(LAB) 2시간으로 진행해 왔다. 이러한 요구와 여건에 맞추어 이 책을 저술하게 되었다. 

이 책은 실제 강의 내용에 기반하여 LAB 내용(연습문제의 B. 따라하기 실습 및 C. 프로그래밍 실습)을 구성하였다. 수강생들은 LAB 내용(B. 따라하기 실습)을 그대로 따라함으로써 파이썬 언어를 익히고, 간단한 프로그래밍 문제(C. 프로그래밍 실습)를 LAB 시간 내에 완성하는 방식을 따랐다. 이 책을 사용하는 모든 사람이 이와 동일한 방법으로 비교적 단시간 내에 파이썬 언어의 모든 것을 배우고 활용 능력을 발휘해 나갈 수 있을 것이다.

익숙하지 않을 뿐, 부족한 게 아니에요’라는 슬로건 아래, 이제 막 사회에 발을 들여 모든 것이 낯설고 두려운 뽀시래기 직장인들을 위한 뉴스레터를 만들고 있는 <뽀시래기의 지식 한 장> 팀이 신입사원이나 IT 용어가 낯선 이들이 현장에서 바로 써먹을 수 있는 실무 용어들을 모아 한 권의 책으로 엮은 것이다. 

이 책에서는 총 175개의 용어를 7개의 분야로 나눠 설명하고 있는데, 우리의 뽀시래기 직장인들이 궁금해하는 용어가 실제 현장에서 어떻게 활용되는지 대화와 상황 설명을 통해 보여주고, 뽀식이 캐릭터를 활용한 일러스트와 더 알아두면 좋은 정보를 통해 해당 용어를 실무에서 완벽하게 이해 혹은 활용할 수 있도록 도와주고 있다.

많은 인문학자들이 입을 모아 현재를 ‘대변혁의 시대’라고 칭한다. 전 인류를 위협하는 질병과, 경제 위기 등으로 매일 아침 우리는 변화를 맞이하고 그에 발맞추어야 하는 시대를 살고 있다. 이런 격변의 시기에 우리는 어떻게 살아가야 하는가? 한국인이 맞닥뜨린 이 존재론적 고민에 대한 해결의 실마리를 제시하기 위해, 대한민국 대표 석학 12인이 한자리에 모였다. 기후 위기 등 환경 문제(최재천, 공우석, 제임스 후퍼), 삶과 죽음을 대하는 자세(유성호, 정상훈), 코로나 이후 자본의 흐름(홍익희, 유인경), 운과 운명(강헌, 박성준) 그리고 미래를 주도할 열쇠 메타버스(김상균, 강유정, 전범선)까지. 인생을 구성하는 핵심 키워드를 놓고, 방대한 지식을 바탕으로 더 나은 삶에 대한 예리한 인사이트를 풀어 놓는다. 『한국인을 읽는다』는 이 시대에 현대인이 필수로 갖춰야 할 지식과 통찰을 묶어 놓은 현대 지성의 산물이다. 삶이 갈피를 잡지 못해 부유한다고 느끼는가? 이 책의 지식과 통찰은 당신의 삶에 지혜라는 돛을 달아줄 것이다.

한국판 뉴딜정책에 대해 진단하고 그 성과를 기반으로 더 큰 보폭으로 디지털 혁신 시대를 준비하기 위해 출간된 도서이다. 여기에는 뉴노멀 트렌드를 고려한 전통산업의 디지털 전환, 디지털 산업의 신성장, 비대면 시대의 신산업 트렌드, 뉴노멀 시대 신인류와 교육혁신, 지역균형발전과 양극화 해소, 재난안전관리와 스마트 복지, 스마트 정부와 공공혁신 등의 주제에 대해 각 분야의 전문가와 학자들이 1년여 동안 연구한 내용이 담겨있다.

그간 추진해온 ‘한국판 뉴딜’의 성과를 딛고 디지털 혁신으로 이루는 미래 비전을 준비해 모든 국민이 더불어 행복한 명실상부한 혁신적 포용국가로 거듭나야 할 것이다. 조금만 더 체계적으로 노력한다면 ‘디지털 융합 경제’시대를 이끌 더 강한 대한민국이 될 r것이다.

이미 강남 아파트 가격이 미국 맨해튼의 평당 가격을 넘어선 지 오래다. 자산은 버블 국면에 진입하면 그 자체의 관성으로 계속 오르는 경향이 있다. 언젠가 터질 것을 알지만 적어도 내 앞은 아닐 것이라는 낙관론, 정부가 무언가 할 것이라는 학습 효과가 지금과 같은 2030세대의 비이성적인 주택 추격 매수까지 양산하고 있다.

경제학자들의 경제학자, 한계혁명의 주창자 레옹 발라. 그의 경제학 체계는 그 자신의 분류에 따라 순수 정치경제학, 응용 정치경제학, 사회경제학으로 나뉘는데, 이 중 발라 경제학의 바탕이자 삼부작 중 첫 책이 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫이다. 그가 이후 ≪사회경제학 연구≫≪응용 정치경제학 연구≫를 논문집으로 발간하는 데 그쳤던 것은 ≪순수 정치경제학 원론≫을 체계화해 이론서로 발간한 후 더 이상 그러한 작업을 기력이 없었기 때문이다. 발라의 역작일 수밖에 없다.

영국의 경제사학자이자 『존 메이너드 케인스』 전기 3부작으로 세계적 명성을 얻은 원로 경제 석학 로버트 스키델스키 교수의 최신 화제작. 2008년 글로벌 금융 위기 예측 실패 이후 별다른 진보를 보이지 못한 ‘주류 경제학(신고전주의 경제학)’의 문제점을 총체적으로 진단하고 처방을 모색한다. 모두 13개 장을 할애해 ‘방법론적 결함’에서 ‘학문적 불완전성’까지 치밀하게 살핀다. 비판의 강도가 높고 범위도 넓다.

이 책에서 스키델스키 교수는 작심하고 주류 경제학을 공격하지만, 그 의도는 경제학을 향한 깊은 믿음과 기대에 있다. 그가 보기에 경제학이야말로 인류에게 ‘더 나은 삶’을 열어줄 수 있는 가장 강력하고 현실적인 학문이기 때문이다. 그는 경제학 본연의 역할을 되찾아주고자 이 책을 썼다.

세계 제일의 케인스 전문가라는 타이틀 탓에 ‘케인스주의’로의 회귀를 주장할 것 같지만 그렇지 않고, 주류 경제학을 공격한다고 해서 비주류 경제학을 옹호하는 것도 아니다. 저자는 ‘신고전주의’가 경제학의 주류가 된 배경을 명확히 인지하되, 그 속의 심각한 결함을 바로잡아야 ‘더 나은 삶을 위한 경제학’으로의 대전환을 이룰 수 있다고 역설한다.
