From the Census Bureau: "The median sales price of new houses sold in July 2021 was $390,500.  The average sales price was $446,000."
The following graph shows the median and average new home prices.
 Click on graph for larger image.
During the housing bust, the builders had to build smaller and less expensive homes to compete with all the distressed sales.  When housing started to recovery - with limited finished lots in recovering areas - builders moved to higher price points to maximize profits.

Then the average and median house prices mostly moved sideways since 2017 due to home builders offering more lower priced homes.  Prices picked up during the pandemic, and really picked up recently.
The average price in July 2021 was a record $446,00, up 18% year-over-year.  The median price was a record $390,500, up 18% year-over-year.  
The second graph shows the percent of new homes sold by price.
Very few new homes sold were under $200K in July 2021 (about 1.6% of all homes).  This is down from 56% in 2002.  In general, the under $200K bracket is going away.    
The $400K and greater than $500K+ brackets increased significantly over the last decade.  


Half of new homes (about 50% in July) in the U.S., are in the $200K to $400K range.  The fastest growing price segment over the last 2 years has been the $400K to $500K range.]]></summary>

This was somewhat above consensus expectations for July, but still down 27.2% year-over-year - since sales increased sharply following the early months of the pandemic.  The new home sales rate is now slightly below the pre-pandemic level of around 740 thousand (the three months previous to pandemic).

This graph shows new home sales for 2020 and 2021 by month (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate).
The year-over-year comparisons were easy in the first half of 2021 - especially in March and April.
However, sales will likely be down year-over-year for the remainder of 2021 - since the selling season was delayed in 2020.
And on inventory: note that completed inventory (3rd graph in previous post) is near record lows, but inventory under construction is closer to normal.
This graph shows the months of supply by stage of construction.
  
The inventory of completed homes for sale was at 36 thousand in July, just above the record low of 33 thousand in March, April and May 2021. That is about 0.6 months of completed supply (just above the record low).

The inventory of new homes under construction is at 3.8 months - slightly above the normal level.


However, a record 105 thousand homes have not been started - about 1.8 months of supply - about double the normal level.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digitalization of Money is a crossroad in monetary history. Advances in technology has led to the development of new forms of money: virtual (crypto) currencies like bitcoin; stable coins like libra/diem; and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) like the Bahamian sand dollar. These innovations in money and finance have resonance to earlier shifts in monetary history: 1) The shift in the eighteenth and nineteenth century from commodity money (gold and silver coins) to convertible fiduciary money and inconvertible fiat money; 2) the shift in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from central bank notes to a central bank monopoly; 3) Then evolution since the seventeenth century of central banks and the tools of monetary policy. 

This paper analyzes the arguments for a CBDC through the lens of monetary history. The bottom line is that the history of transformations in monetary systems suggests that technical change in money is inevitably driven by the financial incentives of a market economy. Government has always had a key role in the provision of outside money, which is a public good. Government has also regulated inside money provided by the private sector. This held for fiduciary money and will likely hold for digital money. CBDC could make monetary policy more efficient, and it could transform the international monetary and payments systems.]]></summary>

It is crucial to study the complex industrial organization (IO) of these exchanges in order to assess their impacts to date, during the first decade of the ACA, and in order to project their impacts going forward. We revisit the inherent market failures in health care markets that necessitate key ACA exchange regulations and investigate whether they have succeeded in their goals of expanding coverage, creating robust marketplaces, providing product variety, and generating innovation in health care delivery. We discuss empirical IO research to date and also highlight shortcomings in the existing research that can be addressed moving forward. We conclude with a discussion of IO research-based policy lessons for the ACA exchanges and, more generally, for managed competition of private insurance in health care.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unemployment is notoriously difficult to predict.  In previous studies, once country fixed effects are added to panel estimates, few variables predict changes in unemployment rates.  Using panel data for 29 European countries over 439 months between 1985 and 2021 in an unbalanced country*month panel of just over 10000 observations, we predict changes in the unemployment rate 12 months in advance based on individuals’ fears of unemployment, their perceptions of the economic situation and their own household financial situation.  Fear of unemployment predicts subsequent changes in unemployment 12 months later in the presence of country fixed effects and lagged unemployment.  Individuals’ perceptions of the economic situation in the country and their own household finances also predict unemployment 12 months later. Business sentiment (industry fear of unemployment) is also predictive of unemployment 12 months later.  The findings underscore the importance of the “economics of walking about”. The implication is that these social survey data are informative in predicting economic downturns and should be used more extensively in forecasting.  We also generate a 29 country-level annual panel on life satisfaction from 1985-2020 from the World Database of Happiness and show that the consumer level fear of unemployment variable lowers well-being over and above the negative impact of the unemployment rate itself.  Qualitative survey metrics were able to predict the Great Recession and the economic slowdown in Europe just prior to the COVID19 pandemic.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper analyzes the impact of exchange rate risk on global food supply chains. Although the theoretical literature suggests ambivalence regarding the sign and magnitude of this effect, most empirical studies indicate a negative association between exchange rate volatility and international trade flows. I contribute to the ongoing debate by investigating the relationship at the product-level using a sectoral gravity model and relying on detailed retrospective trade and exchange rate data for a balanced panel of 159 countries for 2001 to 2017. I study the relationship for 781 agricultural and food products and estimate the trade effects of short-run and long-run exchange rate volatility. My findings indicate significant heterogeneity in the trade effects of exchange rate risk. While the mean trade effects are positive for short-run and long-run volatility, these effects vary substantially according to product and industry characteristics. I find a positive association between exchange rate volatility and the trade effects for upstreamness and a negative association for downstreamness of the traded products. I show that the significant and adverse trade effects in earlier studies result from model misspecification and measurement errors. This research enhances the understanding of the implications of exchange rate volatility which is a primary source of international risk exposure for global food supply chains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People’s perceptions about others play an important role in shaping their own attitudes and behaviors, as well as social norms more broadly. This review presents a meta-analysis of the recent empirical literature that examines perceptions about others in the field. We document a number of stylized facts. Misperceptions about others are widespread, asymmetric, much larger when about out-group members, and positively associated with one’s own attitudes. Experimental treatments to re-calibrate misperceptions generally work as intended; they sometimes lead to meaningful changes in behaviors, though this often occurs only immediately after the treatments. We discuss different conceptual frameworks that could explain the origin, persistence, and rigidity of misperceptions about others. We point to several directions for future research.]]></summary>

Just what makes for an effective bureaucracy and what are the building blocks of state capacity remain subject to debate.  This paper reviews the arguments connecting contemporary research using administrative data and field experiments to wider discussions of the origins of state capacity.  Most current research has been focused on understanding specific features of the environment in which bureaucrats operate. We connect this to discussions of bureaucratic systems, specifically the relationship to politics, citizens, firms and NGOs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inducing firms to make specialized investments through bilateral contracts can be challenging because of potential hold- up problems. Such contracting difficulties have long been argued to be an important reason for acquisitions. To evaluate the extent to which this motivation leads to mergers, we perform a textual analysis of the patents filed by the same lead inventors of the target firms before and after the mergers. We find that patents of inventors from target firms become 28.9% to 46.8% more specific to those of acquirers’ inventors following completed mergers, benchmarked against patents filed by targets and a group of counterfactual acquirers. This pattern is stronger for vertical mergers that are likely to require specialized investments. There is no change in the specificity of patents for mergers that are announced but not consummated. Overall, we provide empirical evidence that contracting issues in motivating specialized investment can be a motive for acquisitions.]]></summary>

Ageing-related welfare state policy entails both fiscal issues and migration issues. The paper employs a general-equilibrium model with a policy-making focus, to help understand the mechanism governing the provision of social benefits, labor income taxation, capital income taxation, migration curbs on low skilled and high skilled, driven by the ageing of the population. Greater generosity of the welfare state comes together with policy, incentive compatible with the interests of the majority voters, of a more liberal migration policy.]]></summary>

By abstaining on Friday, the average lender was forced to adjust today's rates slightly higher to account for the bond market weakness.  In other words, this morning's rates were higher than Friday morning's.
As the day progressed, mortgage bonds improved enough for a friendly mid-day reprice.  A majority of lenders pulled the trigger, thus helping rates close the gap with Friday's rates.  Simply put, rates started the day moderately higher versus Friday morning, but are now only marginally higher (assuming the lender in question offered a mid-day price improvement).  ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: This is as of August 15th.
From the MBA: Share of Mortgage Loans in Forbearance Slightly Decreases to 3.25%
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) latest Forbearance  and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 1 basis point from 3.26% of servicers’ portfolio volume in the prior week to 3.25% as of August 15, 2021. According to MBA’s estimate, 1.6 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.
The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 1.66%. Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 3 basis points to 3.92%, while the forbearance share for  portfolio loans and private-label securities (PLS) increased 10 basis points to 7.15%. The percentage of  loans in forbearance for independent mortgage bank (IMB) servicers increased 2 basis points to 3.48%,  and the percentage of loans in forbearance for depository servicers decreased 1 basis point to 3.35%.
“The share of loans in forbearance was little changed, as both new requests and exits were at a slower  pace compared to the prior week. In fact, exits were at their slowest pace in over a year,” said Mike  Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “There were more new forbearance  requests and re-entries for portfolio and PLS loans, leading to a 10-basis-point increase in their share.  Portfolio and PLS loans now account for almost 50% of all depository servicer loans in forbearance and  almost 40% of IMB servicer loans in forbearance, which highlights the importance of this investor  category.”

Two key points:
1) Existing home sales are somewhat above pre-pandemic levels rate of around 5.5 million SAAR (average six months prior to pandemic).  Seasonally adjusted (SA) sales for July 2021 were also the highest since 2006 - about 2% above July 2020. 

Some of the increase in sales over the previous year was probably related to  record low mortgage rates, strong second home buying, a strong stock market and favorable demographics.


Also, the delay in the 2020 buying season pushed the seasonally adjusted number to very high levels over the winter.   This means there are going to be some difficult comparisons in the second half of 2021!

Click on graph for larger image in graph gallery.
This inventory graph is courtesy of Altos Research.

As of August 20th, inventory was at 432 thousand (7 day average), compared to 594 thousand for the same week a year ago.  That is a decline of 27.3%.


Compared to the same week in 2019, inventory is down 55%.


A week ago, inventory was at 422 thousand, and was down 29.8% YoY.  


Seasonally, inventory has bottomed.   Inventory was about 40.8% above the record low in early April.


A couple of interesting points from 2019:   In 2019, inventory bottomed at 814 thousand in February (so inventory is still very low compared to normal levels).   And, in 2019, inventory peaked at 972 thousand in early August (an increase of about 19% from the low).   So inventory is less than half of what we'd normally expect, however inventory has increased (as a percentage) more than normal.


Key question: Usually inventory peaks in the Summer, and then declines into the Fall.  Will inventory follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will inventory continue to increase over the coming months?  This will be important to watch for house prices and housing activity.  

Mike Simonsen discusses this data regularly on Youtube.  


Altos Research has also seen a significant pickup in price decreases - back to the level of a year ago - but still well below a normal rate for August.]]></summary>

This column uses data from the Italian electricity market to challenge this view in the context of the electricity sector, showing that carbon pricing schemes may not work efficiently when the major firms in the market are government controlled. As the vast majority of large electricity generators in the world are government-controlled and the electricity sector accounts for more than 40% of global carbon emissions from fuel combustion, the findings have important policy implications. Properly implemented command and control approaches might be more efficient, especially since reliable estimates of the production functions of electric generators are readily available.]]></summary>

From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures S&P 500 are up 4 and DOW futures are up 30 (fair value).
Oil prices were down over the last week with WTI futures at $62.38 per barrel and Brent at $65.49 per barrel.  A year ago, WTI was at $42, and Brent was at $44 - so WTI oil prices are UP about 50% year-over-year (oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Rates Stuck in The Middle
Rates are on hold until the next chapter is written in the complex saga of covid versus the market. This isn't to say rates perfectly flat--simply that the prevailing momentum has been sideways for the past few weeks.
Since mortgage rates only change once or twice a day, we can use 10yr Treasury yields to see finer detail.  This entire week took place in the fairly narrow range of 1.29 to 1.21, and it ended with yields precisely in the middle at 1.25%.
...
What does all this mean in plain English?  Rates are low--much lower than most anyone expected at this point in the year.  The key reason is "delta" and Fed's patient approach to changing rate-friendly policies.  The lingering concerns about the nature of the post-covid economy also make the list. [30 year fixed 2.93%]

3Q GDP growth is currently coming in at 4.5%, leaving annual growth to slip to 5.9% this year. We think the Delta variant is a large reason for the soft patch as can be seen by the pullback in spending on leisure services.  But we also have to consider the possibility of more permanent supply-side constraints and greater precautionary savings.  [August 20 estimate]

From Goldman Sachs: 
We have lowered our Q3 GDP forecast to +5.5%, reflecting hits to both consumer spending and production. Spending on dining, travel, and some other services is likely to decline in August, though we expect the drop to be modest and brief. Production is still suffering from supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto industry, and this is likely to mean less inventory rebuild in Q3. [August 18 estimate]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Both Black Knight and the MBA (Mortgage Bankers Association) are putting out weekly estimates of mortgages in forbearance.
This data is as of August 17th.
From Andy Walden at Black Knight: Forbearances Edge Slightly Higher
After dropping by more than 150,000 over the past two weeks, we once again saw active forbearance plans edge up slightly in what has become a well-established mid-month trend. 
  
The week’s 11,000 overall increase was driven entirely by a 12,000 rise in plans among Portfolio/PLS loans and offset by a 1,000 decline in GSE forbearances. FHA/VA plan volumes held flat from the week prior. 
  
 According to Black Knight’s McDash Flash forbearance tracker, 1.75 million (3.3% of) borrowers remain in COVID-19 related forbearance plans as of August 17. That population includes 1.9% of GSE, 5.8% of FHA/VA and 4.0% of portfolio-held and privately securitized mortgages.
Plan volumes are now down 110,000 (-5.9%) from the same time last month, with the rate of improvement slowing slightly in recent weeks.
Total plan starts were higher this week, primarily from a rise in re-start activity. New plan starts, though up slightly from last week, remain below the 5-week moving average.  
   Click on graph for larger image.
  
Meanwhile, plan removals hit their lowest weekly total since late May, but mainly due to the fact that review activity was low in general this past week.
 Of those plans reviewed since last Tuesday, 41% resulted in exits, up from the 36% removal rate the same time last month. Activity is poised to pick up significantly with the first wave of final forbearance expirations only weeks away.  
   
 Some 200,000 plans are currently slated for review through the final two weeks of August, with approximately one-third of those reaching their final expiration based on current allowable forbearance term lengths. Volumes of final expirations will increase significantly in September and October.

극중지계 2권. 대한민국 대표 중국 싱크탱크 니어재단과 당대 최고의 중국 경제 전문가들이 2년에 걸친 기획과 탐구, 토론으로 완성한 생존, 자강, 국익의 길. 미중 간 전략적 경쟁은 패권경쟁 양상을 띠고 있고, 점차 체제와 가치 전쟁으로 확대되고 있다. 이 과정에서 중국의 팽창주의적 굴기는 우리에게 중대한 위협이 되고 있다. 기존의 미국적 패권 질서에 편입되어 있던 상황을 위협하고, 중국적 질서와 가치, 중국의 국익을 강요할 가능성이 커지고 있다.

강성대국 중국을 극복하기 위한 비방서로서의, 극중지계(克中之計)인 책. 이 책은 시진핑식 노선이 우리의 주권과 생존권을 어떻게 흔들어놓을지 주시하면서 충돌이나 예속이 아닌 공생의 관계 방정식을 찾아 나간다. 거대한 전환의 시대에 재앙으로 빠지지 않고, 변화를 기회를 바꾸는 방안을 제시한다.

미래 산업과 글로벌 경제의 불확실성에도, 여전히 통계와 데이터에 기반을 둔 시장 분석은 놓칠 수 없는 유효한 수단이다. 데이터에 기반을 둔 정보 분석은 주관적 판단의 오류를 줄여주는 현실적 도구로써, 이는 이 보고서가 1989년 이후 매년 발행되는 이유이기도 하다.

특히 최근처럼 산업 간 경계가 허물어지고, 융합 기술이 중요한 경쟁력의 원천이 되고, 사업의 핵심 축으로 자리 잡게 되면서 인접 산업과 이 업종에 대한 이해와 분석은 점점 더 그 가치가 중요해져 가고 있다. 이에 이 보고서는 사업 기획과 마케팅 전략 수립에 도움을 주고자 국내 주요 산업과 시장에 대한 폭넓은 2차 자료를 최대한 망라해 소개하고 있다.

아시아를 대표하는 전문 미래학자 최윤식 박사의 새 책. 전작 《빅체인지, 코로나19 이후 미래 시나리오》에서 코로나19가 세계 경제에 미칠 영향력을 예고했다면, 이번에는 포스트 코로나 시대에 바이든 대통령의 경제 정책이 주요 선진국과 신흥국에 미칠 영향력을 예측한다.

신자유주의를 폐기하고 새로운 뉴딜 정책을 꺼내든 바이든의 결단은 주식시장을 비롯한 국제 금융시장과 각국 실물경제에 어떤 영향을 미칠까? 우리는 언제 어느 국가의 어떤 산업에 투자해야 최대의 이익을 얻을 수 있을까? 바이든 정부의 움직임을 주시하면 답이 보인다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm gathering existing home data for many local markets, and I'm watching inventory very closely this year.

The table below shows some local market data for July.
As I noted in Some thoughts on Housing Inventory 
The key for housing in 2021 will be inventory. If inventory stays extremely low, there will be more housing starts and a larger increase in house prices. However, if inventory increases significantly, there will be fewer starts and less price appreciation.
Although inventory in these areas is down about 33% year-over-year, inventory is up 13.5% month-to-month (and up 26.5% over the last two months).  Seasonally we'd usually expect a small increase in inventory from June to July - so some of this increase is seasonal (as opposed to a shift in the market).   

It does appear inventory bottomed seasonally in March.  And inventory is still historically very low, but increasing more than just seasonal.

이제껏 세상에 나온 탈성장론들은 체제비판론, 탈성장 미래사회 스케치 수준을 넘지 못했었다. 반면, 탈성장 운동은 이 책 덕분에 비로소 사회경제 시스템 전환 계획을 품은 현실 정치 운동으로 진화하고 있다. 경제성장 없는 그린뉴딜, UBI(보편 기본 소득), UCI(보편 돌봄 소득), UBS(보편 기본 서비스), 커먼스 회복, 노동시간 단축, 공공 금융 제도. 평등한 탈탄소사회라는 미래로 이행하는 데 필요하다고 저자들이 말하는 사회 개혁 정책들이다.

또한 이 책은 우리 시대를 역사적 대전환기라는 인식하에, 어떤 대전환의 비전이 필요한지, 그 청사진을 분명히 제시하고 있어서 눈길을 끈다. 그것은 행복, 평등, 지속가능성, 공동체적 삶, 돌봄, 소박함의 가치를 우선시하며 더 적은 것으로 더 잘 사는 삶이다.

‘파이낸스’라고 하면 ‘기업 재무(corporate finance)’만을 떠올리는 사람이 많다. 하지만 자세히 들여다보면 기업뿐만 아니라 가정과 일상에서도 파이낸스 사고(재무적 사고)를 필요로 한다. 파이낸스 사고법이란 미래에 끼칠 모든 영향을 돈으로 환산하여 파악하고, 상정된 안을 비교해서 가장 적절한 안을 선택하는 방법이다. 일본 디즈니와 맥도날드의 공인회계사인 저자와 함께 인생의 다양한 의사결정을 내리는 데 도움을 주는 파이낸스 사고법을 알아보자.

시작하며

STEP 0 회계 vs. 파이낸스
파이낸스는 다양한 의사결정에 활용할 수 있다
회계는 형식, 파이낸스는 사고방식
회계는 과거, 파이낸스는 미래
회계는 의견, 파이낸스는 사실
회계적 사고와 파이낸스적 사고로 내 집 마련을 생각하다

STEP 1 ‘보이지 않는 비용’을 파악한다
선택을 했더라면 얻을 수 있었던 이익을 비용으로 인식하는 것이 ‘기회비용’
기회비용을 파악하여 미래 매출을 창출한다
과거에 지출한 돈인 ‘매몰 비용’에 대해서는 감정을 배제하고 판단한다
매몰 비용을 무시했어야 할 비즈니스 사례
매몰 비용의 함정을 피하려면 ‘중간 점검’ 시기를 설정해야 한다
매몰 비용을 역으로 이용한다
‘인건비’는 비용 그 자체
‘현금’은 돈을 지출하게 만드는 ‘보이지 않는 비용’
‘시간’을 비용으로 환산한다
파이낸스적 사고를 특정 비용 항목에 국한하여 생각하지 않는다
비용은 신중하게 예측한다

STEP 2 시간가치를 고려한다
장기간에 걸쳐 영향을 미치는 ‘고정비’는 최소한으로 줄인다
고정비보다 더 고정적인 ‘초기 투자 비용
‘회수 기간’은 가능한 짧게 생각한다
‘현금’을 마련하는 데는 비용이 든다
‘언제?’에 따라 돈의 가치는 다르다

STEP 3 차이를 비교한다
비교란 ‘차이점’에 주목하는 것
‘판단 기준’을 정한다
선택지를 빠짐없이 열거하고, 마지막에 비교한다
복수의 안건을 검토할 때는 ‘허들 레이트’를 사용한다
‘금액 = NPV’와 ‘이율 = IRR’을 구분하여 비교한다

STEP 4 수치를 변환하고 이미지를 연상한다
큰 숫자일수록 쉬운 단위로 변환하여 생각한다
단위를 변환하면 ‘방법’이 보인다
단위를 변환하여 구분하면 시기적절한 ‘정기적 관측’이 가능하다
관리 항목을 구분하면 ‘개인의 목표’가 보인다
회사 내에는 수많은 KPI가 존재한다
KPI는 업종의 특성을 고려하여 정한다
‘비중’과 ‘수익’의 관점에서 매출을 늘린다
부문마다 수익성을 구분하면 개별 ‘부문의 최적화’라는 부작용이 발생한다

STEP 5 파이낸스 실전!
실전 #1: 가성비 높은 영어 공부법을 검토한...

컴퓨터 프로그래밍을 배우는 데에 있어서 기초가 되는 논리들을 이해하고, 이를 활용하여 문제를 풀어가면서 프로그램 제작 훈련을 돕기 위해 만들어진 책이다. 이 훈련의 특징은 프로그래밍의 기초부터 응용까지 15단계로 나누어 각 단계마다 필요한 논리와 개념 설명은 최소한으로 줄이고, 간단한 예제를 통해 이해할 수 있도록 설명한다. 

그러므로 다른 C언어 도서에서 다루는 구체적인 문법들이나 이론적인 설명을 자세하게 다루지 않는다. 각 단계마다 조금씩 수준을 높여 가면서 반복되는 실습문제들을 풀게 되는데, 이런 과정을 거치면서 프로그래밍 논리와 문제해결 능력이 향상되도록 하였다.

경기연구원이 기획하고 이재명 경기도지사가 추천한 ‘공정과 지속가능 프로젝트’ 경제 편이다. 이 책은 포스트 코로나 시대에 한국 경제의 구조적 문제점을 진단하고 이를 극복할 공정하고 지속가능한 경제질서와 새로운 경제 패러다임을 모색한다.

코로나19로 인해 한국 경제의 극심한 이중구조가 고스란히 드러나고 있다. 비정규직 노동자, 영세 자영업자, 저소득 계층은 더 큰 고통을 감내해야 하는 상황이다. 대기업이 성장을 기록하는 동안 중소기업은 매출과 이익 저하에 시달리며 생존을 염려하고 있다. 하위 저소득가구의 근로소득은 10%이상 감소했고, 영세 자영업은 사회적 거리 두기를 견디지 못해 폐업하고 있다. 이런 양극화 심화는 현재 소득의 격차로 끝나지 않고 점점 심화되어 불평등이 대물림될 가능성이 크다. 한국 경제는 새로운 패러다임을 구축해야 할 절박한 시점에 처했다.

《지속가능한 공정경제》는 이런 위기와 기회의 측면을 면밀하게 살펴서 지속가능한 공정경제를 위한 화두에 답하고자 한다. 포스트 코로나 시대에 새로운 경제 패러다임이 지향해야 할 시대적 가치는 무엇인지, 새로운 경제질서는 어떤 모습이고 기존 경제질서는 어떻게 재구조화되어야 하는지, 미래지향적 경제질서를 구현하기 위한 정부의 역할과 정책 기준은 무엇이어야 하는지 등을 탐색한다.

자본주의 물질문명이 형성되는 역사의 과정을 쉽고 친절하게, 역사학계의 최신 연구 성과를 바탕으로 깊이 있게 제시하는 책. 지금 우리가 누리는 물질문명이 어떻게 출현하고 발전했는지 동ㆍ서양과 한국을 가로지르고 과거와 현재를 넘나들며 폭넓게 조망한다. 그럼으로써 세계사적 관점에서 현재의 세계를 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다. 

이 책은 300년 동안 급속도로 진행된 이 세계의 변화가 도대체 무엇이었는지 구체적 사실(史實)로 톺아보는데, 저자는 물질문명을 이루어낸 원동력의 범주를 세 가지로 분석한다. 하나는 물질생활을 풍요롭게 만드는 제일 조건인 ‘생산 증대’, 그리고 생산 증대를 가능하게 한 ‘과학 기술의 비약적 발전’, 나머지 하나는 윤택한 생활의 최종 결과이자 오늘날 문명을 지배하는 ‘소비’다.

전설적인 투자가 피터 린치는 이런 말을 했다. “주식을 공부하지 않고 투자하는 것은, 카드를 보지 않고 포커를 치는 것과 같다.” 주식시장이 어떻게 움직이는지, 그리고 투자하려는 기업이 어떤 성격을 지녔는지 모르는 채로 투자한다면 눈을 감고 경기에 참여하는 것만큼 위험하다는 뜻이다. 

그러나 주식을 처음 시작하는 사람들은 대부분 주식을 공부하지 않고 남들이 추천하는 종목을 무작정 따라 산다. 언제 공부를 해서, 언제 수익을 내느냐는 조급한 마음 때문이다. 게다가 유튜브, 블로그 등 주식 정보는 어디를 가나 넘쳐흐르니, 스스로 판단하기보다 고수들의 의견을 따르는 것이 더 현명한 투자일 것 같다. 하지만 과연 이러한 정보들을 무작정 모으고, 남들이 추천하는 종목을 따라 산다고 수익을 낼 수 있을까?

저자 권순우는 경제 유튜브 ‘삼프로TV’와 KBS1 라디오 ‘성공예감 김방희입니다’에서 주식시장에서 일어나는 다양한 이슈의 맥락을 날카롭게 짚어주면서 주식 투자자들의 열렬한 신뢰를 얻고 있는 경제부 기자다. 그는 “주식 투자에서 가장 중요한 것은 정보의 맥락을 이해하는 것”이라고 강조한다. 아무리 양질의 정보가 있다 해도 주식 투자를 전체적으로 바라보는 밑그림이 없다면 올바로 해석하고 적용할 수 없기 때문이다.

자료 구조를 좀 더 쉽게 공부하기 위해 단순히 자료 구조의 구현에 집중하기보다는 “인덱스는 어떻게 작동하기에 데이터베이스의 성능을 좋게 만들 수 있을까?”라는 한 가지 질문을 던져 놓고 이 질문의 답을 찾아가는 과정을 담았다. 모든 자료 구조를 다루진 않지만 이 과정에서 다룰 수 있는 여러 가지 자료 구조를 배우며, 개념을 확장해 나가는 방식으로 설명한다. 

빅오, 재귀 함수에서부터 다양한 그래프 알고리즘까지 그림 184개로 필수 자료 구조의 핵심 개념을 익힌 후 파이썬으로 구현한 코드도 직접 확인하고 실행해 볼 수 있다. 또한, 실제 자료 구조를 어디에 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지도 엿볼 수 있다. 이 책이 자료 구조를 학습하려는 분들에게 시작점이자 다른 유명한 자료 구조 책을 볼 수 있게 해주는 징검다리 역할을 해줄 것이다.

저자가 그간 국책연구기관에서 수행했던 연구와 정부정책 수립 경험, 대학에서 경제정책론을 강의하면서 공부했던 내용에 바탕을 두고 정리한 책이다. 전통적인 학문과 정책의 세계를 넘나들면서 인적자원을 ‘시간, 공간, 인간’의 3간이 서로 융합되는 간학문적인 관점에서 논의한다. 인적자원으로서 사람의 역량을 기르는 것뿐만 아니라 길러진 역량을 활용하는 것도 중요하게 다룬다. 특히 한 인간의 삶 전체를 인적자원의 관점에서 조망한다.

현대 소프트웨어는 하드웨어의 성능 발전에 힘입어 많은 부분에서 추성화된 덕택에 코딩에 입문하기도 쉬워졌고 원하는 프로그램을 만들기도 쉬워졌다. 하지만 컴퓨터를 더 잘 이해하고 싶고 프로그래밍을 더 잘 하고 싶은 사람들에게는 불투명한 벽이 생긴 셈이다. 이 책은 그 어떤 다른 도구나 라이브러리를 사용하지 않고 인터프리터, 컴파일러, 가상머신을 직접 구현해보며 추상화라는 벽 뒤에서 실제로 일어나고 있는 일들을 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다.

《밑바닥부터 만드는 인터프리터 in Go》의 후속편. 인터프리터와 컴파일러의 가장 큰 차이점은 중간코드, 즉 목적코드의 존재 유무에 있다. 전편처럼 테스트 주도 개발 방법을 이용해, 컴파일러의 작은 부품에서부터 시작하여 점차 고급 기능으로 확장해간다. 

이런 전개의 장점은 컴파일러의 구조와 코드를 독자가 매우 쉽게 이해하게 된다는 점입니다. 레고 부품을 조립해 하나의 완성된 테마를 만들 때처럼, 구현물이 테스트를 통과할 때마다 컴파일러의 동작 원리를 깨치는 재미가 제법 쏠쏠하다.

드래곤북 류의 방대한 이론을 담은 책도, 50줄의 코드로 장난감 같은 인터프리터를 뚝딱 만드는 블로그 수준의 글을 모아놓은 책도 아니다. 저자는 그 중간 어느 지점에서 이론보다는 구현을, 여러 기능의 나열보다는 인터프리터를 제대로 이해하기 위한 본질적이면서 교육적인 기능에 초점을 맞추어 책을 집필하였다.

사상 최악의 주가 폭락은 과연 코로나 팬데믹 탓인가? 그렇지 않다. 이미 주가가 최대치로 부풀어 올랐기 때문에 터진 것일 뿐이다. 버블의 진리. 한껏 부풀어오르면 그다음에는 터질 일만 남는다. 코로나는 계기일 뿐이었다. 그런데 각국 정부는 다시금 양적 완화로 경제위기를 틀어막았다. 그로 인해 또 다른 버블이 생겼다. 이제 막다른 길이 코앞에 다가왔다. 코로나 이후 우리는 어떻게 해야 할까? 

일본 경제학계의 대표 석학이자 행동파 경제학자인 오바타 세키 교수는 코로나 이후 혼란스러운 경제상황을 냉정히 분석하고 앞으로의 변화를 날카롭게 예측한다. 아무도 경험하지 못한 '애프터 코로나'의 세계는 어떻게 변화해 갈까? 앞으로 세계경제는 성장할까, 아니면 버블의 최종 국면으로 터져버리고 말까?
 
저자는 근대 자본주의가 연명할 수 있을지, 정부와 개인이 더 나은 세상을 위해 무엇을 해야 하는지 놀랍도록 직관적인 통찰과 대담한 솔루션을 제시한다. 저자의 통찰을 따라가다 보면 일본 경제를 넘어 '포스트 코로나' 시대 세계 경제가 나아갈 방향을 알려주는 이정표를 만날 수 있을 것이다.

프롤로그 버블이 만들어낸 경제성장, 버블이 파괴한 경제성장
버블 애프터 버블｜근대 자본주의는 버블이다｜버블의 세 가지 순환｜경제성장은 버블의 확대｜
코로나 위기와 버블의 마지막 국면

제1장 버블 애프터 버블의 30년_사상 최악의 주가 폭락은 왜 일어났는가
코로나 위기와 주가 대폭락은 무관하다｜리먼 사태 후에 왜 다시 버블이?｜모든 시장에서 버블 발생｜냉전 종료와 30년 버블｜시장 자본주의는 유동화를 통한 수탈이다｜버블에 이은 버블｜코로나 위기 버블｜실물경제 버블에서 시작된 재정파탄

제2장 코로나 위기는 사상 최대급 위기인가_'급변하는 사회'는 있을 수 없다
애프터 코로나는 없다｜대공황이 아니라 마지막 버블이 다가온다｜'평범한' 불황에 그친다｜스톡 쇼크가 아닌 플로 쇼크｜공급 쇼크는 존재하지 않는다｜이기주의에서 비롯된 마스크 문제｜끄떡없는 금융시스템｜정크본드 버블과 금융위기｜버블이 '또''다시' 찾아왔다

제3장 모든 가격은 버블이다_원유 선물 -40달러는 무엇을 의미하는가
전대미문의 원유 선물 마이너스 가격｜수요와 구매는 별개｜원유의 적정가격은 없다｜원유가 비싼 것은 우연의 일치다｜금도 다이아몬드도 가치는 없다｜가치가 없는 것일수록 비싸진다｜금은 가격 상승으로 가치를 잃었다｜가격이 오르는 것이 리스크｜산업구조를 결정짓는 것은 가격｜가격 설정 혼란이 가져온 것｜가격은 대부분 버블

제4장 새로운 차원의 금융정책이 필요하다_양적 완화는 시대착오
전무후무한 경제 대책｜불요불급은 불요｜기업이 아닌 사람을 지킨다｜대기업이 아닌, 사람과 경제를 지킨다｜코로나 이전의 관광은 버블이었다｜금융정책의 근본적인 변경｜부채의 화폐화는 이미 시작되었다｜양의 세 가지 해로움｜인플레는 일어나지 않고 일으킬 수도 없다｜새로운 차원의 금융완화｜금융정책은 자산시장도 타깃으로｜리스크프리미엄 타깃

제5장 '안심' 신화가 재정을 파탄으로 내몬다_코로나 대책이 산으로 가는 이유
코로나 리스크는 제로가 될 수 없다｜제로 리스크 신화｜안심을 위해 안전을 희생하는 나라｜제로 리스크 지향에 의한 사고 정지｜전 국민 PCR 검사는 왜 틀렸는가｜검사가 안심을 가져다주지는 않는다｜거리 두기의 세 가지 행동 패턴｜...

부동산 중개업 시장에서 최고 난이도는 빌딩 시장이다. 그만큼 누구나 하고 싶어 하지만 아무나 도전할 수 없는 영역이기도 하다. 현재 주택에 대한 대출이 막혔고, 다주택자 및 고급주택에 대한 고세율 부가정책 등 주택을 투자재로서 매력을 잃게 만든 여러 규제로 인해 꼬마빌딩 투자 시장이 화두가 되고 있다. 이처럼 경기불황 속 빌딩매매에 대한 관심은 꾸준히 이어질 것으로 예상된다. 

이 책에서는 주택이 없는 근린생활시설 꼬마빌딩의 매매에 관해 다루었다. 빌딩 매입 사전지식부터 필수 실무지식을 거쳐 구매 이후 관리까지 건물 투자와 관련한 저자만의 실전 경험과 지식 노하우를 아낌없이 담았다. 학군, 교통, 편의시설, 집값을 주도하는 서울 강남구 지역을 전격 분석했으며, 책 속 지도에는 QR코드를 삽입하여 해당 위치를 그 자리에서 바로 살펴볼 수 있다. 부동산 전문가의 시선에서 바라본 빌딩매매 시장을 디테일하게 분석하여 ‘전문성’도 살렸다. 부디 부동산 재테크에 뛰어든 초보 투자자들에게 이해하기 쉽고 술술 읽히는 책이 되길 바란다.

fastai 라이브러리는 딥러닝 응용에 일관된 인터페이스를 최초로 제공하며 '모두를 위한 딥러닝'을 가능하게 한다. 이제 더 이상 딥러닝은 구글, 페이스북, 마이크로소프트 등 거대 기술 기업의 전유물이 아니다. 파이썬에 친숙한 프로그래머라면 약간의 수학적 배경지식, 소규모 데이터, 짧은 코드만으로도 딥러닝을 구현하는 놀라운 경험을 얻을 수 있다. 이 책에서 fastai 라이브러리의 창시자인 제러미와 실뱅은 fastai와 파이토치로 다양한 작업에 대한 모델을 학습시키는 방법을 소개한다. 또한 내부적인 알고리즘을 완전히 이해하는 데 필요한 딥러닝 이론도 설명한다.

신(新)중국 성립부터 지금까지의 중국 국가발전전략과 규획의 수립 및 실행적 과정을 돌이켜 보며, 국제적인 시각과 시대의 변화에 끊임없이 동조하는 자세로 그 중의 경험과 교훈에 대하여 평가와 총결을 진행하는 책이다. 국가발전전략의 분석 방면에서 저자는 전략적 패러다임 및 유파의 개념을 제시하였고, 이를 근거로 중국과 외국의 전략 유형에 대해 이론적 귀납을 진행하였으며 새로운 시대적 관점에서 앞으로의 중국 국가발전전략의 선택 및 방향을 분석하였다.

국가발전규획의 분석 방면에서 저자는 규획의 변천, 경험과 규획의 실행 과정에서 존재하는 문제를 실마리로 삼아 어떻게 국가규획사업의 품질을 제고하고, 규획체계를 완비할 것인지에 대해 연구하였는데 구체적으로 국가의 총체적 규획의 개선, 지역 규획의 완비와 그에 따른 기타 규획과의 관계, 시?현급(市縣級) 규획체제의 개혁, 주체기능구역 규획의 완비 및 규획의 법제화 등이다.

자본주의와 산업화의 역사를 꼼꼼히 살펴본다. 또한 이 현대문명의 사상적 · 기술적 기초가 된 다양한 철학자들과 과학자들의 영향과 기여들에 대해서도 소개한다. 이렇게 살펴본 산업자본주의의 발자취를 토대로, ‘스마트 공동체 사회’라는 희망적 대안을 제시한다. 

이곳은 욕망의 경제권력과 지식권력을 내려놓고 완전고용을 달성하여 빈부의 격차가 없고, 재화와 쾌락이 평등하게 분배되는 사회이다. 이 사회는 인류의 밝은 미래를 가져오기 위해 스마트주의에 입각하여 발전된 기술혁신의 인공지능, 생명공학, 그리고 로봇이 현생인류의 생존을 위협하지 않고 인간을 위해 봉사하고, 지구환경을 회복시켜 이룩한 지속가능의 미래가 보장되는 사회이다. 

인류가 역사를 시작하며 끊임없이 질문해온 ‘어떻게 하면 자연재해, 전쟁, 기아, 질병이 사라진 이상향을 만들 수 있을까?’ 하는 물음에 대한 해답의 실마리를 이 책을 통해 찾아볼 수 있을 것이다.

코로나 팬데믹이 세계 경제시장을 휩쓸고 있다. 한국경제라고 하여 예외는 아니다. 전 세계 사람들의 국가 간 이동이 막혔다. 세계 모든 나라들이 빗장을 걸어 잠그고 자국의 이익 여하에 따라 이합집산한다. 세계 경제의 패권싸움이 새로운 국면을 맞고 있는 것이다. 이 책은 4차 산업혁명 시대의 도래, 코로나 팬데믹 후 세계 그리고 20대 대선 등 굵직한 선택의 기로에 놓인 한국경제에 대한 전망서다.

투자은행 골드만삭스는 2050년 한국경제 규모가 세계 5위권에 진입할 것으로 예측했다. 새로운 10년 안에 과연 무엇이, 어떻게, 얼마나 빨리, 얼마만큼 변할 것인가? 우리는 무엇을 준비하고, 어떻게 대응해야 하는가? 이는 우리나라와 사회의 ‘지속 가능한 생존’ 문제와 직결된다. 

저자는 국민 화해, 통합과 공존과 경제, 교육, 외교 혁명을 통해 경제성장의 속도를 높인다면 이를 15년 빨리 2030년대까지 달성할 수 있을 것이라 본다. 그가 제안하는 10년 후 한국, 우리가 선택해야 할 3가지 핵심이슈를 알아본다.
